two counts, fi rst degree murder.

yes, i'm sure she's fine.

## do i sound very foolish to you?
oh, no.

## do you think cathy's alright?
annie's there.

## i'm not like this, you know?
not usually.

## would you like to rest now?
no.

## why, mrs brenner?
because my son seems to be very fond of you.

## is that so important, your liking me?
well, yes.

## why don't you try to sleep now, mrs brenner?
i wish i were stronger.

## would you like me to go for her?
oh, i couldn't ask it.

## would you?
i'd feel so much better.

## melanie?
thanks for the tea.

look.

## leave school?
we want those of you who live nearby to go directly home.

## home?
i want the rest of you to go all the way down to the hotel.

## is that clear?
yes, miss hayworth.

## melanie?
i want you to go as quietly as possible.

## now, does everybody understand?
yes, miss hayworth.

## what's the name of the school?
just the bodega bay school.

## help you, mrs bundy?
i need some change, mr carter.

## is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?
there is very definitely a difference.

## you have the number at the fawcett farm?
right here in this book, miss.

## yes, may i speak to mitch brenner, please?
i'm glad i caught you.

## what actually happened at the school?
bunch of crows attacked the school kids.

## which gulls, mr sholes?
there are several varieties.

## have you had trouble with gulls?
one of my boats did, last week.

## could you ask them to lower their voices, please?
they're frightening the children.

## what do you think they were after, miss uh...?
daniels.

## for what purpose?
to kill them.

## why?
i don't know why.

## doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait all that time to start a war against humanity?
no one called it a war.

## want some more coffee?
no... came down on one of my boats.

## huh?
gulls are scavengers, anyway.

## why not, mrs bundy?
because there are 8, 650 species of birds in the world today, mr carter.

## are the birds going to eat us, mommy?
we couldn't, you're right.

## something wrong?
we're fighting a war.

## you've frightened the children half out of their wits.
a war?

## who attacked the school?
birds did.

## what's the fastest way to san francisco?
the freeway, ma'am.

## how do i find it?
i'm going out that way, lady.

## where's cathy?
she's with annie.

## al, why aren't you over at the school, where the attack was?
i just got back from dan fawcett's place.

## what?
hold it, you don't know that for a fact.

## what are the facts?
the santa rosa police think it's a felony murder.

## how do they explain the dead birds all over the floor?
santa rosa police figure they got in after the old man was killed.

## are you coming?
now take it easy, lady.

## what do i owe you, deke?
sebastian, hold it a minute.

## huh?
i don't want to be an alarmist, but no one ever said you were.

## to ignore what?
no, mitch, frankly i don't.

## if you help, they all will.
isn't that a reason?

## what do you want to do?
( cawing.

## how long have they been gathering there?
oh, about 15 minutes.

## seems like a pattern, doesn't it?
they strike, then disappear, and then start massing again.

## doesn't look so very different, does it?
a little smoke hanging over the town, otherwise...

## you want to try your father again?
no, i tried a little while ago.

## still got power, haven't we?
i'll have to get some more wood.

## did you get the windows in the attic?
yes, i got them all.

## when do you think they'll come?
i don't know.

## when?
we'll just see what happens.

## where will we go?
i don't know.

## i'm sorry, mitch.
what happens when you run out of wood?

## where are they heading?
somewhere inland.

## santa rosa?
maybe.

## but, mom, they're in a cage.
mitch?

## mitch, why are they doing this, the birds?
we don't know, honey.

## why are they trying to kill people?
i wish i could say.

## mitch?
( gasps.

## can you finish the bandaging?
i'll try.

## mitch?
see if you can get anything on the car radio.

## did you hear anything on the radio?
it's alright.

## stay there.
mitch?

## can i bring the lovebirds, mitch?
they haven't harmed anyone.

## what do you suppose it is?
oh, no, certainly not.

## i'll call.
and he'll talk?

## would you mind waiting?
well, maybe you'd better deliver him.

## would you mind if i called?
no.

## what?
i said, i wonder if you could help me.

## what is it you're looking for, sir?
lovebirds.

## lovebirds, sir?
yes.

## is that true?
well, yes, there are.

## do you happen to have a pair of birds that are... just friendly?
oh, i think so.

## aren't those lovebirds?
no.

## doesn't what make me feel having all these poor, innocent creatures caged up like this?
well, we can't just let them fly around the shop.

## i is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
certainly.

## are they molting now?
oh, some of them are.

## how can you tell?
well, they... get a sort of hangdog expression.

## are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead?
we have some very nice canaries this week.

## back in your gilded cage, melanie daniels.
may i see it, please?

## what did you say?
i was merely drawing a parallel, miss daniels.

## how did you know my name?
a little birdie told me.

## how?
we met in court.

## don't you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a window?
i didn't break that window.

i think you're a louse.

## who was that man?
i have no idea.

## may i use this phone?
why, certainly.

## daily news?
it's melanie daniels.

i loathe you.

## what did it say?
none of your business.

## mitch?
i thought i saw your car.

i'd love one.

## is that your father?

## this afternoon?
that proves what i'm saying.

## he sold mr. fawcett a different brand.
you don't think there's something going around, do you?

## you don't think they're getting sick, do you, mitch?
i still don't understand how you knew i wanted lovebirds.

## is that right?
he was watching a ball game on television.

## what?
his wife changed the channel.

## are you coming to my party tomorrow?
i don't think so.

## don't you like us?
oh, darling, of course i do.

no, no.

## where did you go to law school?
forgive me.

## she's very rich, isn't she?

i'm neither poor nor innocent.

## do you really know annie hayworth?
no.

## so you didn't go to school together?
no.

## yes, i was lying.
and you didn't come here to see her?

## is that a lie?
no, i wrote the letter.

## well, what did it say?
i think you need these lovebirds after all.

## but you tore it up?
yes.

## why?
because it seemed stupid and foolish.

## why?
i think it might be fun.

## what do you want?
i thought you knew.

## miss daniels, is that you?
yes.

## is that cut beginning to bother you?
no, it's not the cut that's bothering me.

## would you like some brandy?
if you have some, i'd love it.

## different?
with lydia.

## did she seem a trifle distant?
mm, a trifle.

## well, what had you done?
nothing.

## a clinging, possessive mother?
wrong.

## then what was it?
lydia liked me.

## then why did she object to you?
because she was afraid.

## afraid you'd take mitch?
afraid i'd give mitch.

## didn't he have anything to say about this?
well, i can understand his position.

## then what are you doing here in bodega bay?
i wanted to be near mitch.

## hello?
oh, yes, this is melanie.

## brinkmeyer's?
mm hmm.

## do you think i should go?
well, that's up to you.

## no, it's really up to lydia, isn't it?

yes, and the freeway is much quicker.

## do about what?

## were the kids bothering the birds or something?
if you make any kind of a disturbance near them, they'll come after you.

## you want help cleaning up?

man, we're on a roll.

## hmm?
i don't know.

## are you really talking to us from the clubhouse?
well, they're not gonna play me until i come home, so i might as well do something else with my time.

## stan, how does it feel not to be playing right now?
it don't feel good, especially the way i've been swinging, but that's skip's decision.

## how's it feel?
to tell you the truth, we never thought you could do it, and some of us hoped you wouldn't, so we owe you an apology big time.

## what the hell is he talking about?
stan.

## what does the future hold?
yeah, stan.

## what game are you gonna get this hit in?
i think i'm gonna get it on the next at bat.

## you got another homer left in you?
stan ross.

## is it gonna be a home run?

mr. 3000.

## what does stanley ross think of mr. 3000?

## really?
really.

## what about your teammates?
they don't need it.

## so what you're saying is, your teammates get to see your 3, 000th hit, but not potentially move into third place?
what i'm saying is, thousands of people bought tickets this weekend, not to see us play for third place, but to see me get my hit.

## really?
damn right.

## i mean, how am i supposed to think about moving here when you can't do what you say you're gonna do?
mo, it's only one damn practice, baby.

## you gonna run after her?

of course i beat it.

## is that guy for real?
yeah, he's for real.

## are you here to confirm that daredevil is responsible for this, detective?
come on, urich.

## got it?
got it.

## what are you playing at, matt?
you didn't come here for forgiveness.

## is that how you want to live your life?
a lawyer during the day...... and then judge and jury at night.

## is that what you want?
somebody has to do something.

## well, why you?
because i can.

## like the alligators in the sewers?
there are alligators in the sewers.

## they have a picture?
it's a drawing, an artist's rendering.

## did you know that?
i didn't.

## will you pass the honey, please?
we need better clients.

## what is your problem with our clients?
we have good, honorable clients.

## better means rich and guilty, okay?
law school taught us to create a moral vacuum...... so you can represent people who aren't innocent.

## where?
front door.

## you want the truth?
absolutely.

## could you help me out?
right in front of you.

## blind?
yeah.

## friend of yours?

you're holding back.

## does every guy have to go through this to find out your name?
try asking for my number.

## have you seen the papers today?
somebody's been talking.

## you think it's funny?
they're writing about the kingpin.

details.

## the billionaire?
yeah, see.

## what's the word for that?
mulatto.

## but who can afford to fly these days?
so i said...

more peanuts, please.

## you don't remember me?
thanks, buddy.

## how can you not remember the kingpin?
no, no, no, no.

## why?

## what time are you gonna pick me up?
i'm not going.

that place is gonna be crawling with rich people.

## are you finished?
we only have an hour to prepare for court.

## what's eating you?
rough night.

## well, you want to talk about it?
no.

## it's about elektra, isn't it?
no.

## let's really bury the needle, huh?
swish.

## so does this mean you want a rematch?
i knew i'd find you.

## how did you know i wasn't a mugger?
muggers don't usually wear rose oil or high heels.

## exactly how many women have you brought up here, anyway?
you're my first.

## what's this?
that's from my mother.

## it's a good luck charm, huh?
i could use one of those.

## do they make them in braille?
she gave it to me right before she died.

## what happened?
i should go.

## matt?
i'm sorry.

## aren't you happy you listened to me?
this is gonna be great for business.

## you write articles about urban legends, right?
well, yes, among other things.

## you know the alligators in the sewers?
my partner...

## they gotta be huge by now, right, the alligators?
it's a myth.

## okay?
wesley.

## yes, why is that, mr. murdock?
because we only handle clients who are innocent.

## what's that?
nobody's innocent.

## it's like that?
it's like that.

## matt?
now i found you.

## do you mind?
no, i just...

## what's wrong?
it's just...... good things don't happen to me very often.

## doesn't she look beautiful?
i think she's happy.

## what, you have to bring that up now?
history has a way of repeating itself.

## what are you saying?
just saying goodbye, old friend.

## i'm sorry.
what is it?

## what is going on?
new york is not a safe place tonight.

## drop something?
bullseye.

## how'd it go?
oh, you know.

## coming to bed?
aye, in a bit.

## i mean, lots of people have their photos taken with their tops off on holiday in lbiza, don't they?

## i've screwed up a bloody gain, haven't i?
yet a bloody gain.

## what is the difference between this and the venus de milo?
oh, i love quizzes.

## can you just clear frame for me?
ok, celia, just lean in toward t'camera a little bit.

i'll be disappointed if they look at me fingers.

## what's your name?
ruth.

## lawrence, who's next?
ruth.

## what's the result?
i've got us a sponsor.

i want to make an announcement.

## sorry?

## which wi are you?
we're from knapely.

## i beg your pardon?
address the whole conference, please.

## sorry, does the other member from knapely want to say something?
yes, because she's about to commit heresy.

## can i assume this is a local fundraiser and you're not gonna be making too big a hoo ha out of it?
in which case, it's a branch matter, and i can leave any decision in the hands of your branch president.

## evening news?
morning herald?.

## did you invite the journalist from the gazette?
yes.

## right, where are we?
i think it's down here.

## what bigger than this has happened in knapely tonight?

not only are we not going to raise it, we're actually going to lose it.

## you after the wi thing?
yes.

## open up, maya, love, will ya?
i have, mum.

## what's your family think?
i was worried my daughter would be embarrassed, but she talked me into it.

## can i help you, officer?
you can put that joint out for a start.

## hollywood?
it's not for fun.

## can you get that?
i'm in a meeting.

## is it not illegal then?
yes, all right.

## where the hell is it?
ah, passport.

## the holidays are all different there, aren't they?
well, maybe we'll have to do a reprint.

sorry.

## the one that makes a tart of herself by taking her clothes off, or me?
sod off.

there was no need to queue, madam.

## what are you doing?
i'm going up.

## is that right?
clarke.

## or should i call you miss february?
i saw your picture in the paper this morning.

## now, i'll just talk you through the facilities, ok?
right.

## is everything ok, ma'am?
yeah, no, it's fine.

## right.
have you been in your bathroom?

## i mean, the press will be all over it by now.
what are we doing first, then, eh?

## so rod's having to deal with all that on his own, then, is he?
well, him and jem.

## are you all right?
oh, yeah.

## so, have you had a think about that, then?
yes.

## well, you know what?
let me talk with my associates, and i'll get back to you.

## who was on the phone?
very exciting.

## who?
very exciting.

## by the way, is it lee no or leh no?
we've gotta get it right.

## are you sure?
no, i think it's lee no.

## advert?
well, they sponsor us, we do their advert for washing powder.

## can i have it straight like jennifer aniston?
you know, in friends.

## why would i dye just part of my head?
it doesn't make any sense.

## how are you?
good to see you.

## have you girls been strippers all your lives?
we're not strippers.

## did you get drunk beforehand?
it was no big deal, you know.

## the same bits?
yes.

## can i have some of them rice things?
it's called sushi.

## what are you doing?
you missed it.

## welcome, ladies.
hello?

## how are we today?
fine.

## and which one of you is chris?
you're chris.

## exciting, hm?
yeah, yeah.

## sorry?
we're doing the washing powder, right, hanging the washing on the line.

## it is what you girls do, isn't it?
yeah.

## what do you think?
it's great.

## is the agency happy?
we are.

## look, are you gonna talk to me?
i need a shower.

## was it down here?
i feel dirty.

## my washing powder?
down here.

## this is cos i've organised it, right?
you cannot stand that i've made this calendar a success.

## when you're standing in a cardboard street talking about meeting george clooney.
what's that supposed to mean?

## doesn't that smack just a little bit of being a star?
loads of people lose their partners to this disease.

## eh?
i'm not a saint, because i'd rob every penny from this calendar if it would buy me just one more hour with him.

## are you coming?
hello, love.

## how's jem?
he made a quiche on tuesday.

## everything you said in the paper was true, wasn't it?
i didn't know he was a journalist.

## just why didn't you say it to me?
i know you'd have liked me to.

## where is it?
right, thank you.

## directly above us.
anyone fancy some chips?

## is that possible?
we got company.

## what is that thing?
some kind of tunneling machine.

## what?
look where we are.

## what's four kilometers straight down?
someone had to get to a drop point.

## i was in my own little world.
what?

## is it important?
very.

## oh, god.
what the hell's the matter with you people?

## yeah, what was that?
i don't know.

## how else would you explain it?
well, i can't. that's why we're conducting a little something called an investigation.

## what's gonna happen to the baby now, sheriff?
well, he'll be placed with child services until we can find a home for him.

## you think the baby's... the baby's not from earth?
we found him in a crater, just like you and mom found me.

## is he okay?
if you can believe it, all his crying is a good sign.

## me?
yeah.

## uh... when does child services come and take him?
they're not.

## could you pick up some formula on the way?
sure.

## how are youon diapers?
the diapers... pretty good.

## did he just leave her there?
if he did, he might still be alive.

## can you trace this call back to the cell phone?
i can try.

## so, uh, why am i here, if not for the, uh, pleasure of your company?
it's time to repay old debts, lionel.

## who do you think ended up with the prize?
well, my son hasn't been listening to me for years.

## lionel.
what do you want me to do, give him a good spanking?

## huh?
here, try this.

## yeah?
there you go.

## could you hand mea diaper?
here you go.

## okay?
have fun.

## why don't we call him evan?
i think he likes it.

## step back from what?
well, maybe we shouldn't get so attached.

## clark, what's happening?
clark, wha...

## what are you doing, son? an exciting new venture, something worthy of a captain of industry?
i'm simply continuing where you left off, dad.

## why not just come out and ask for it yourself?
i'm here as a father who's concerned about the safety of his son.

## you think she'd hesitate to do the same to you?
i don't have it.

## where is evan now?
in the loft with lana.

## what are we gonna tell the doctors... he's some second generation meteor freak?
he'll either wind up in belle reve or a laboratory for the rest of his life.

## if i were in trouble, and lex was the only one who could help, what would you do?
you must be very kind to him, to teach him all he needs to know in rabbit land.

## you know how to read?
i've read all of clark's books.

## the encyclopedia, huh?
that's a pretty long book.

## why are you looking at me like that?
um... you are a very, very special boy, evan.

## really?
yeah.

## like what?
like a real windmill.

## mom's taking me to see a real windmill.
can we go right now?

## wanna come?
um... evan...

## i'm sure they love you very much.
if you're not my mom and dad, where are they?

## are we going to the windmill?
uh... we will, but first, i want to take you to meet a friend of mine.

## lex, is he gonna be all right?
tell us what's happening.

## charging for what?
the theory we're working on is that once enough energy is stored, it's expended to fuel a burst of rapid cell division.

## is there any way to stop it?
my team believes a bone marrow transplant might slow the growth and bring his metabolism back to normal.

## can we use my bone marrow?
we're willing to do anything to help.

## unbelievable.
what's going to happen to evan if we can't?

## what's wrong with me?
prep the level 3 facility.

## i'm dying, aren't i?
evan, don't say that.

## and if we can find your father... do you really think they're gonna find a cure for me overnight?
it's like my life was just some sort of trick that was played on me.

## don't talk like that, all right?
we just have to keep trying.

## would you go see if he's okay?
i need to find his father.

## how long was she pregnant for?
well, last weekend, christina varrano had a party at her house, and karen apparently went nc 17 with some guy in the bedroom.

## so she got pregnant and delivered a baby a week later?
we need to find evan's father.

## does tanner sutherland work here?
yeah, he's over there.

## tanner?
leave your car around back, i'll get to it.

## hey, were you at christina varrano's party last week?
uh, i don't remember.

## look, dude, i don't have a son, and...
so you didn't hook up with karen gallagher?

## i don't know what you're talking about, all right?
i got work to do.

## what's your problem?
my problem is your son needs your help.

## what?
no.

## how could someone do that to their own son?
clark, being a father is an enormous responsibility.

## but what's more important right now is what are we gonna tell evan?
maybe it's best i don't even tell him i found his father.

## i'll talk to him, okay?
i mean, i do have a little experience in that department.

## clark, where is he?
he works downtown... at massey's auto garage.

## when can i see him?
look, evan, um, sometimes, when you meet your biological father, it can be painful.

## why?
i don't understand.

## just calm down, okay?
stop telling me what to do, clark.

## is there any possibility of an error?
we've run the projections three times.

## where is he?
he's here in smallville, but he doesn't want to help.

## you're saying evan's about to die?
it's a lot worse than that.

## what are you staring at?
my father.

## why won't you admit it?
dad.

## oh, my god what have i done?
okay, dad, call me if you find him.

## what happened?
evan's gone.

## are you okay?
i don't know.

## are you all right?
it's happening again.

## i'm gonna call clark, and we're gonna get you help, okay?
it's coming.

## the windmill that you told me about, remember?
where the whole world stretches out around you.

## chloe, has evan been here?
no.

## power surges?
yeah, they've been popping up all over town for the last hour.

## what's this?
it's the dwp grid.

## where's the most recent one?
um...

## why would lana and evan be way out there?
the windmill.

## the one at chandler field?
you were right.

## what's happening?
he's gone.

## really?
yeah.

## don't all my visits deserve to be celebrated, genevieve?
some more than others.

## mmm... do you have something for me?
i most certainly do.

## parenthood... it's an interesting phenomen on, isn't it?
the lengths we go to... to protect our children.

## how about a trade?
you give me the stone that you stole from bridgette crosby, and i give you... the antidote.

## is that understood?
the element, genevieve.

## where is it?
you did everything you could, clark.

## all the times that i've run off or disappeared or almost died, how do you guys deal with that?
it isn't easy, clark, but it does come with the territory.

## why not?
i'm from another planet.

## who knows if i can have kids?
clark, your father and i couldn't have children.

## what do you mean?
i'm releasing our findings to every research facility across the globe.

## mr. luthor... are you sure you want to release the findings?
eventually...

## that's great, i...
are you kidding me?

## are you ok?
coach, i'll take care of him.

## clark, what's the matter son?
i hear ringing.

## can you tell me where it's coming from?
i need to go.

## what, you didn't think i would trek all the way out here without having a chat with your doctor?
right there.

## what the hell are you doing here?
your father he... wanted to see me.

## did he ask you to tackle me to the floor while you're at it?
he had something sharp, lex...

## do you ever feel guilty?
about sending your father to prison, i mean.

## why would i?
the man murdered his parents.

## clark, since when did you become president of my father's fan club?
hey clark.

## are you feeling all right?
i feel fine.

## lift what?
the tractor.

## how would i do that?
very funny, clark, but i don't have all day.

## what's that?
oh... it's just... boy, is it dirty under here.

## are you sure you're all right?
never felt better in my life.

## lex?
no, i'm not lex.

## one of his teams found it in an underwater ruin off the coast of honduras.
where did lionel get this?

## well he's scouring the globe. these ancient symbols?
they've shown up in egypt...

## how do you know that?
i'm a mathematician, i'm looking for hidden patterns in the sea scrolls, money doesn't really mean a lot to me.

## you know what happened?
i was framed.

## yeah, that was pretty lucky, huh?
all i have to do is give him a hand with a couple of these symbols, and he set me up with his lawyers.

## what do you mean?
he's dying.

## how may i help you sir?
this...

## sure.... sure.
what?

## dinner's ready, but the way you're dressed are you going out?
um, no, no, i justed wanted a change, i'm bored with plaid.

## what are you doing?
well, i.... i just...

## is it because of that ringing you heard?
i, i don't know.

## how are you feeling?
it's good to see you up and around.

## you sure?
cause you're looking at me like you have absolutely no idea who i am.

## you just want to quit the team?
precisely.

## how do i do that?
well, once a week, you get a turn, unless you know how to work the system.

## what's in it for me?
i can get you out of here.

## c'mon, if the real lionel luthor can't do it, what are you going to do?
that senile act isn't going to work, trump.

## what's one more?
lex... changed the password.

## if lionel luthor managed somehow to get out of prison, what do you suppose he'd do?
about you i mean.

## do you know something i don't?
no....

## well, what exactly is that supposed to mean?
i have to confess that i...

## clark, what are you doing?
what i've wanted to do for a very... very long time.

## don't tell me the countess ran a coffee shop?
no, she's from this village in france.

## what do you think it all means?
i don't know.

## what do you think?
i wanted to thank you...

## they haven't so far, have they?
i need you to do something for me.

## why?
because if you don't, your good friend lex... will very shortly be dead.

## may i please have your mother's maiden name?
mehan.

## clark?
this one.

## do you have any idea what i have to offer you?
yeah, yeah i think i do.

## oh lana i'm very different, let me show you.
you're the one that broke up with me, remember?

## who the hell do you think you are?
i was in lionel's body.

## or spinning daydreams?
i don't remember you being a scotch drinker.

## this castle?
luthorcorp, the cars, the jets, everything to the very cuff links in your sleeves.

## i've been trying to reach you.
dad?

## where have you been?
hi sweetheart.

## tell me what weakens me.
what are you talking about martha?

## what is it?
i have no idea what you're talking about.

## i've done some more reading, and it's not good, so i hope you're getting this, cause you should come see me, a. s. a. p.
does this thing work?

## is that really you in there lionel?
no, it's the easter bunny.

## what did you find, what did the rest of the codes say?
turns out, the transferrence is eventually going to come to an end.

## save murder.
when?

## the artifact, where is it?
guards took it from me, yeah they thought it was a weapon.

## got something for me?
yeah i'm still working on it.

## you think this is some kind of game?
there's no overtime here.

## what happened to concealing your powers?
sorry, only one clark allowed.

## a farm boy?
well, for starters... you quit the football team.

## where's the artifact now, clark?
i put it in a chamber in the cave wall.

## why didn't you tell us about this earlier?
with everything we've been through with jor el, i just wanted to close that chapter in my life.

## and i think lionel luthor would disagree with that, don't you?
and now that he knows about your powers, he's more dangerous than ever.

## clark, what are you talking about?
lionel luthor's dying, dad.

## how can that be possible?
i have no idea.

## have you been taking any unregulated meds... supplements?
no.

## another convenient case of amnesia, huh?
no, but whatever it is, i'm really sorry.

## clark, you know what?
it's a really valiant effort, but you've used up your lifetime allotment of apologies.

## what?
don't play games with me, clark.

## this isn't about you and me, alright?
this is about jason losing his job.

## why do you think?
if anyone had the slightest inkling that we were a couple, he'd be fired in a heartbeat.

## you and jason?
we're both adults, and we're not hurting anybody.

## please, after everything you've put me through, can you at least keep this a secret?
it seems to be the one thing that you're good at.

## welcome back.
what'd he say that we always joke about?

## so you know what happened?
well, it was a bit of a giveaway when you asked for $57 million dollars.

## i mean, you expect me to give my blessings to this... thing?

some gender confused wolf telling him that his princess is already married.

## where are we?

## sourdough soft taco, then?

## who's the guy?
well, he's not a guy, per se.

## i hope i'm not interrupting, but i'm told you're the one to talk to about an ogre problem?
you are told correct.

## would... this be enough?
you have engaged my valuable services, your majesty.

## a little father son time?
i know it would mean the world to fiona.

## i know.
shall we say, 7:30 by the old oak?

## i'm sorry, all right?
hey, don't worry about it.

## what?
i ain't purring.

## a hug?
first there was the time that old farmer tried to sell me for some magic beans.

## is it on?
this is fairy godmother.

## let's go, shrek.

## look at him... in his wee little boots.

## you heard that, huh?
the whole kingdom heard you.

## him?
you know, you didn't exactly roll out the welcome wagon.

## well, what did you expect?

## no, really?
shh...

## right away.

## look, she's not seeing any clients today, ok?
that's ok, buddy.

## mama's working.

## everything is accounted for, fairy godmother, except for one potion.
whoa, what happened here?

## what?
oh...

## you both will be fine?
i guess it means it'll affect fiona, too.

## how bad can it be?
see, you're allergic to that stuff.

## how do you feel?
i don't feel any different.

## i look any different?
you still look like an ass to me.

## shrek?
you drink that, there's no going back.

## no more wallowing in the mud?
i know.

## uh oh.

the potion changed a lot of things, fiona.

## do you think so?
dad.

## who are you?
mom, it's me, shrek.

## i don't think they can hear us, pigeon.
i know you never get a second chance at a first impression, but, well, what do you think?

## don't you think you've already messed her life up enough?
i just wanted her to be happy.

## shrek?
senor.

## hey.
what's going on?

## why the long face?
it was all just a stupid mistake.

## what choice do i have?
she loves that pretty boy, prince charming.

## and that's why i have to let her go.
is he really that good iooking?

## excuse me, is she here?
she's, uh... in the back.

## i mean, how charming can i be when i have to pretend i'm that dreadful ogre?
no, no, it's nobody's fault.

## umm... no.
perhaps it's best if we just call the whole thing off, okay?

## what did you say?
i can't.

## is it?
no.

## mother?
um...

## who is this?
may all your endings be happy and...

## darling?

## donkey?
too late.

## pardon me, would you mind letting me go?
sorry, boss.

## he's down on drury lane.

## why?

now that he's dead you're their only lead.

## i haven't?
well, it's the money, mrs. lampert, the money.

## his or theirs?
ours.

## you mean it's just lying around somewhere, all that cash?
or a certified check, safe deposit key, baggage claim.

## is that clear?
here's where you're to call me, day or night.

## didn't you telephone me to meet you on that corner over there?
i'm sorry.

## do you understand french?
that's the policeman.

## what's she saying now?
that she's innocent.

## well, who was that?
that's punch, of course.

## what am i going to do?
i wish you'd let me help you.

## starting tonight?
fun and games.

## you and me?
everyone.

## are you ready?
uno, due, tre...

## tell me what?
it doesn't belong to you.

## you do know that, don't you?
he stepped on my foot.

## mr. bartholomew, can you hear me?
mr. bartholomew, this is regina lampert.

## what do you want?
no, i'm not.

## what are you doing in here?
i'm having a nervous breakdown.

## what happened back there?
i'm not sure if i'm supposed to tell you or not.

## what does that mean?
he said if i told anybody... it could prove fatal for them as well as me.

## who said?
that's what i'm not supposed to say.

## would you mind seeing me to the door?
of course not.

## what was what?
what your husband was mixed up in.

## look, i know it's asking you to stretch your imagination, but don't you think... you could pretend just for a moment that i'm a woman?
i could already be arrested for transporting a minor above the first floor.

## where?
on the street where you live.

## how about getting out of here?
come on, child.

## won't you come in for a minute?
no, i won't.

## how'd you like a punch in the nose?
stop treating me like a child.

## do you know what's wrong with you?
no.

## what?
oh, peter.

## are you hurt?
mm hmm.

## how are you?
scared.

## where did he go?
out the window, i guess.

## walk up and shake you by that hand of yours?
dumb move, herman.

## you want some more?
never mind that.

## how could i with the three marx brothers breathing down my neck?
yeah, i have.

## why?
get another room.

## if you do find that money, you ain't gonna forget to tell your buddies about it, are you?
don't worry.

## you see this little fella here?
oh, he worries.

## who is it?
it's me, peter.

## why don't you confide in me and tell me what this is all about?
there are three men.

## promise me you'll never lie to me the way charles did.
where's the money?

## why do people have to tell lies?
usually because they want something.

## hello?
mrs. lampert, it's me, the man who was in your room a few minutes ago.

## who is it?
it's the man you had the fight with.

## who?
the man i had the fight with, lady.

## is he still there?
yes, that's right.

## what's he saying?
don't trust him.

## what was all that about?
he...

## what?
someone who wasn't in that photograph today.

## are you still there, mr. bartholomew?
yes, yes, mrs. lampert.

## you mean... he might have?
mr. bartholomew, i'm catching the next plane out of here.

## at les halles?
yes.

## were you followed?
yes, by dyle.

## carson?
there's only one dyle connected with this affair, mrs. lampert.

## it's enough to make you a vegetarian, isn't it?
it's just lucky i'm not hanging next to one of those right now.

## why didn't you tell me you knew about dyle?
i didn't see any point.

## mr. bartholomew, what is all this about?
the five men were your husband charles, the three men at his funeral yesterday...

## how?
by burying it, then reporting the germans had captured it.

## may i have a cigarette, please?
i can't stand those things.

## what was wrong with that one?
nothing, i guess.

## have you any idea what these things cost over here?
please go on, mr. bartholomew.

## what happened then?
carson dyle was dead, but scobie was able to travel.

## la soupe, c'est pour qui?
pour moi.

## where was i?
carson dyle was dead.

## we know what happened from the bits we were able to paste together, but we still have no proof.
but if they stole all that money, why can't you arrest them?

## what's this got to do with the c. i. o.?
c. i. a., mrs. lampert.

## why me?
nice to see you.

## when did you arrive?
it's a lovely town.

## are you having a good time?
so many things to see.

## yes?
good morning, mr. dyle.

## reggie?
it's the only name i've got.

## he was my brother.
what do you want to know?

## your brother?
the army thinks he was killed in action by the germans, but i think they did it...

## how can i?
you lied to me just the way charles did.

## i can't call you that anymore, can i?
take me a while to get used to your new name.

## hello?
do anything funny or try to talk to anyone and i'll kill you, dyle.

## now what?
we wait.

## do i knock or something?
the view had better be worth it.

## now what?
i was afraid of that.

## to ask me that?
she has it.

## supposing i had it... which i don't... do you really think i'd just hand it over to you?
step back.

## back where?
that's the idea.

## is that you?
yeah.

## you gonna open up?
sure.

## what happened?
oh, i met a man with sharp nails.

## scobie?
mm hmm.

## w w what is that stuff?
no.

## but then, you can lie from any position, can't you?
yes.

## is there a mrs. dyle?
yes, but we're divorced.

## why couldn't you just look at his feet?
because he's wearing moccasins.

## which one are you?
a truthful whitefoot.

## do you wanna look at my feet?
yes.

## you just said an horrible word.
can't you be serious?

## what did i say?
serious.

## how about that, hmm?
reggie, cut it out.

## now what are you doing?
cutting it out.

## who told you to do that?
you did.

## ain't that cute?
they've got jean louis.

## are you a real cowboy?
yeah, sure i am, kid.

## howdy, miz lampert.
so where's your gun?

## who invited him?
well, herman, i see you had a happy landing.

## then who does?
i don't know, herman.

## me?
or you.

## don't you see?
if he left, he'd be admitting his guilt.

## why don't we search their rooms?
that's all right with us.

## you have something to hide?
then there are no objections.

## who gets your vote?
scobie.

## tex?
man, that's charlie's stuff.

## why bother him?
oh.

## sure there's nothing missing here?
no, everything's here.

## meaning what?
suppose one of us has it.

## now, if you had a treasure, where would you hide it?
i would bury it in the garden.

## well, if you had to hide it in this room, where would you put it?
up there.

## you know something?
no.

## what do you mean, no?
up there.

## it's herman's spare.
yeah?

## where is he?
he's over in my room.

## oh, now, who would've done a mean thing like that?
i'm not quite sure.

## a man drowned in his bed?
impossible.

## which is it?
dyle.

## didn't you know it was against the law to register under an assumed name?
no, i didn't.

## gideon?
possibly.

## or tex?
possibly.

## what?
i think tex did it.

## why do you think tex did it?
because i really suspect gideon, and it's always the person you don't suspect.

## what's so illogical about that?
you just said it's always the one you don't suspect.

## who?
women.

## what, like scobie?
no.

## you remember when he danced down here by the river in an american in paris... without a care in the world?
mmm.

## want some?
uh...

## what makes you think that this someone is going to be satisfied with three?
he wants it all.

## what, assassinate someone?
no.

## who put that there?
it's the house detective.

## why don't you have a girl in there?
god, you're a pest.

## can i come in?
no.

## what for?
got you.

## did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
the shower's in there.

## why don't you call one of them?
i dare you.

## what are you doing?
taking off my shoes.

## did you ever hear of anyone taking a shower with their shoes on?
i usually sing a medley of old favorites when i'm in the shower.

## any requests?
come in and watch.

## how often do you go through this little ritual?
bartholomew.

## are you sure there's no mistake?
none whatsoever.

## is something wrong?
you're probably weak from hunger.

## i don't suppose you know who the murderer is, do you?
no.

## become the next victim?
it's a start, anyway.

## well, i can't very well leave without a pair of water wings, can i?
all right, get set for the story of my life.

## fiction or nonfiction?
eh...

## are you going to listen?
go on.

## you mean, you're a thief?
well, that's not exactly the term i'd have chosen, but it sort of captures the spirit of the thing.

## adam canfield?
mm hmm.

## is there a mrs. canfield?
yes, but we're divorced.

## how did i lead you on?
i don't suppose so.

## hasn't it occurred to you that i'm having a tough time keeping my hands off you?
oh, you should see your face.

## what's the matter with it?
it's lovely.

## now what's the trouble?
i'm not hungry anymore.

## you don't look so bad in this light.
isn't it glorious?

## why do you think i brought you here?
maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work... the competition was turning out.

## pretty good, huh?
i taught them everything they do.

## oh, did they do that kind of thing way back in your day?
sure.

## not allowed to kiss back, huh?
well, come on.

## are you out of your mind?
it's 3:30 in the morning.

## three of them, all in their pyjamas?
c'est ridicule.

## what is it, some new american fad?
and now your friend who lives here, uh, the one from texas, he has disappeared into thin air.

## where is he?
i wish i knew.

## madame?
tell me, mr. dyle.

## where were you at 3:30 a. m.?
in my room, asleep.

## and you, mrs. lampert?
i was too.

## in mr. dyle's room?
no, in my room.

## obviously you're telling the truth, for why would you invent such a ridiculous story?
and if i were you, i wouldn't stay in my pyjamas.

## you're gonna go looking for him now?
if the police find him first, they're not going to turn over that quarter of a million to us.

## yeah?
now you listen to me, dyle.

## where are you, tex?
come on, man.

## why?
i just heard from him.

she batted all of them big eyes at you... and you fell for it like an egg from a tall chicken.

## you want the envelope?
i'm waiting for jean louis.

## what's he up to?
he was so excited when he got the stamps you gave him this morning.

## what's all this?
the stamp market.

i can't think of a reason in the world why you should.

## oh.

it's only a quarter million.

## who's a taxpayer?
crooks don't pay taxes.

## who would i see regarding the return of stolen government money?

## mr. cruikshank?
a miss lamp...

## crooked?
i should think you'd be glad to find out i'm not crooked.

## why didn't you say something?
we're not allowed to tell.

there's a restaurant in the marina.

## why do you live on a boat?
i hate mowing lawns.

## why do you live onshore?
because that's where my warm, cozy apartment is.

## does he stay with you?
yeah.

## any hope?
start thinking about your sister...... who her friends were, where she went, all of her routines.

## how come?
that's just an angle i'm working on.

## cordell?
yeah.

## you sure?
positive.

## why?
it may be nothing.

## what?
cordell was killed at an atm machine two weeks before your sister died.

## why would she know cordell?
they were both in the wrong place at the wrong time.

## what?
nothing, but...

## what is it?
glory had this piece of jewelry she always wore.

## what was it?
it was a single earring, a dangling crucifix.

## so, what does it mean?
nothing.

## are you okay?
yeah.

## what's up?
you're working tomorrow, 6 a. m.

## who wants to go to the desert anyhow?
we go where the clues lead.

## don't any clues lead to the beach?
they lead where they lead.

## back in the day, when you were going up against all those sickos?
that was my job.

## what?
when i was at the top of my game, i felt connected to everything.

## mrs. cordell?
i'm terry mccaleb.

## as opposed to a good time?
poor choice of words.

## is that your partner in the car?
yeah.

## you work for the police?
no, i'm a retired fbi agent.

## is that someone he might have known?
i don't think so.

## is that the victim from canoga park?
right.

## is that her son?
i don't understand.

## are you suggesting they...?
no, nothing like that.

## then, like what?
the smallest detail of them coming in contact is very, very important.

## a restaurant the killer went to?
yeah.

## rings, watches?
no.

## you're sure he couldn't have been in the valley two weeks before?
no, he spent a month in northern california, working on the aqueduct.

## is that his car?
yes.

## any personal effects in that?
a picture on the dashboard.

## still there?
i don't know.

## can i...?
there it is.

## any of this stuff your husband's favorite knickknacks?
no, sorry.

## could you jot down your husband's routines for me...?
his sunglasses.

## what?
they hung from the mirror on a cord.

## what kind of glasses?
they were wayfarers.

## i said, what do you think it means?
probably nothing.

## you okay?
yeah, i'm okay.

## what profile?
take me to the l. a. county sheriff's office.

## why would the killer go back?
okay.

## how about workmen's comp?
detective winston's in the field.

## can i take a message?
tell her mccaleb was by.

## how about that?
it's mccaleb, jaye.

## what are they doing here?
this alley is the line.

## the line?
south side's l. a. p. d., north is sheriff's department.

## what are you talking about?
he's saying this case is closed.

## of what?
a serial killer.

## what are you talking about?
i was at the atm crime scene.

## and this?
i don't care what you call him.

## maybe it was a wig?
maybe.

## you wanna sit down?
i'm fine, goddamn it.

## looks like a. 38 to me.
why don't you lay down?

## why'd he put a. 38 slug in his mouth?
same reason he died on the jurisdiction line.

## worried?
yeah.

## about what?
that i might bust this case.

## gloria torres, that victim you didn't give a shit about?
i've got her heart.

## ever think about that?
pain in the ass.

## how much do i owe you?
i don't know, 200 or so.

## take a check?
yeah, sure.

## buddy?
jasper.

## i look more like a buddy than a jasper, huh?
yeah.

## what?
that's the link between cordell and your sister.

## blood?
i'll cover tomorrow's shift.

## don't you ever use a cell phone?
i don't believe in them.

## is there another way to find out?
if he gave blood often, he'd be on the computer.

## which computer?
the bopra computer.

## what do you mean, babysitting?
yeah.

## how much?
i don't know.

## what's wrong?
nothing.

## is there a place we could talk privately?
i need to talk to you.

## who's this?
graciella rivers, the one i told you about.

## what do you want?
we wanted to know...

## what?
she was the same blood type as mccaleb, ab with cmv negative.

## what do you want?
i want you to access the bopra computer.

## what's that?
yes.

## stop what?
everything.

## deceased?
no, donor.

## both organ donors?
cordell died on the scene, and gloria lived just long enough.

## what are you saying?
i missed it, damn it.

## what did you miss?
her blood.

## who?
that's the customer who came in, bandaged her head and called 911.

## detective jaye winston?
graciella rivers.

## what's up?
the surveillance camera's three seconds behind the ccw clock.

## that son of a bitch.
okay, so?

## what is it?
this guy here...... this unidentified good samaritan, who tried to help gloria.

## what's that?
the clock on the surveillance camera is three seconds behind the 911 clock.

## all right, and...?
we think he made the call before he killed her.

## could this good samaritan be the same guy you saw at the atm machine?
i don't know.

## you got those atm tapes?
no.

## what do you think about lockridge for this?
i don't know, maybe.

## lockridge is a computer man, right?
and he lives and works in my jurisdiction.

## why don't you pop the trunk?
i'll put this stuff in the back.

## you're killing me here.
what the fuck is he doing?

## you okay?
yeah.

## you okay?
yeah.

## what do you mean?
we just shot up the valley.

## did you hit anyone?
no, thank god.

## is he ill?
he hasn't called...... and he didn't come in yesterday either.

## doesn't that look like probable cause to you?
let's go.

## you okay?
yeah.

## want some coffee?
no, go home.

## how much beer do i owe you?
seven cases...... but since he's a good kid and a great fisherman, i'll take two.

## how are you?
me and buddy caught so many fish he had to get more bait.

## really?
it must be a harbor record.

## so?
i'm not sure yet, but it's looking good.

## when will you know?
soon, hopefully.

## but i'm glad i can still smile about her, you know?
i couldn't at first.

## see?
you can look at it.

## what's this?
oh, that's some code i was supposed to break, but i never could do it.

## what?
there's no 1.

## how about that?
no 1 s.

## can i stay?
no.

## were you just going to let me sit here and eat alone?
raymond loves this boat, and he was wondering if he could spend the night.

## what's wrong?
i don't know.

## mr. mccaleb, did you think this was over?
i can't comment, i don't know anything about anything.

## what?
it's all right.

## paper said something you didn't like?
ballistics will match this slug with the one in bolotov's mouth.

## what does that mean?
i shot him two years ago.

## any idea why?
i had a media profile, so did he.

## what do you make of that?
i don't know.

## what do the numbers mean?
don't know that either.

## except what?
there's no digit number one.

## just cop to cop, what's going on here?
cordell, gloria torres...

## hey, ter!
graciella?

## have you seen graciella and raymond?
i don't know.

## what?
raise it up.

## when did you figure it out?
on the check.

## what else you wanna know?
that necklace belonged to a girl named sunny.

## what?
kill me, no one will find them.

## what do you want?
i want you to live.

## can't you see i've been getting you back to where you need to be?
i'm not interested.

## what was the word?
i almost came when you said that.

## hear some love song on the radio, you start crying?
you don't look so good, ter.

## remember?
salvage company's gonna demo it next week.

## after her sister died for you?
that's tough for her to get around.

## did your father teach you to run a boat?
yeah.

## all right?
yeah.

## remember how you said i was your friend and i could tell you the truth?
well, i don't need you at all.

## you okay?
yeah, i'm okay.

## two of them okay?
yeah, if everyone will leave them alone...... not get them any more involved.

## how are you planning to deal with all this?
i'll probably just let that guide me.

## excuse me?
police work can get kind of heavy on you.

## you got anyone at home?
next time you come around this dock, this mexican will kick your ass.

## we're almost there.
what?

## sir, are you sure about this?
i told you, we're going to be all right.

## yes, sir?
given your situation, i can't say i understand your reasons...... for volunteering to operate onboard my ship.

## what's that, sir?
to trust me.

## you wanna talk?
they're just dreams.

## are we ready to go?
we're already late.

## how fast are they moving?
control estimates their descent at 100 meters an hour.

## how deep are they?
almost 2000 meters.

## what about the scans from the osiris?
they can't be accurate.

## why not?
a sentinel for every man, woman and child in zion.

## what are we gonna do?
we're gonna do what commander lock ordered.

## and does the commander have a plan for stopping 250, 000 sentinels?
a strategy is still being formulated.

## what do you think we should do, morpheus?
we should proceed as ordered...

## what is it?
i don't know.... however, i must ask one of you for help.

## do you understand what you're asking?
i am asking that one ship remain here in our place...... in case the oracle should attempt to contact us.

## what happens when you get back to zion...... and the commander throws you in the stockade?
he won't.

## how did you know someone was here?
he gave you this.

## is everything all right, sir?
the meeting is over.

## agents?
go.

## do we proceed?
yes.

## what happened?
i can't figure it out.

## okay?
shit, you should've seen him.

## where is he now?
he's doing his superman thing.

## where are you?
this is the nebuchadnezzar, requesting access through gate three.

## are you here to escort me to the stockade, captain?
i'm just here to keep the peace.

## sir?
i want the ship ready to go as soon as possible.

## morpheus and lock?
niobe.

## captain niobe?
she used to be with morpheus.

## what happened?
morpheus went to the oracle.

## doesn't he have anything better to do?
you know what they say about the life you save.

## can i carry that for you?
no, i can carry my own bag.

## trinity?
i'm fine.

## hey, you know, next year i'm old enough to join a crew, right?
i've been thinking about it, and i've made my decision.

## how?
neo.

## something big is happening, isn't it?
hey.

## what would you advise?
the truth.

## what makes you so sure?
consider what we have seen, councillor.

## are you thinking what i'm thinking?
i am if you're thinking this elevator is too slow.

## how long do we charge the neb?
twenty four, maybe 30 hours.

## okay?
all right.

## what are you feeding these two?
every ship up there's been home two, even three times more than the nebuchadnezzar.

## why?
you know why.

## you think cas thinks it's fair that i'm here and dozer's not?
i lost two brothers to that ship, link.

## how can you say that to me?
because of morpheus.

## they started yet?
only councillor hamann's opening prayer.

## follow me.
why?

## what's wrong?
it's okay, you can tell me.

## you feel this?
i'm never letting go.

## you all right?
i'll make it.

## did you see that agent?
i've never seen anything like that.

## care for some company?
councillor hamann.

## what about you?
i just haven't been able to sleep much.

## of what?
that you are in fact still human.

## have you ever been to the engineering level?
i love to walk there at night.

## would you like to see it?
sure.

## interesting, isn't it?
the power to give life...

## the idea is pure nonsense...... but it does make one wonder just...... what is control?
if we wanted, we could shut these machines down.

## that's control, isn't it?
if we wanted, we could smash them to bits.

## is that your point, councillor?
no.

## is that why there are no young men on the council?
good point.

## see that machine?
it has something to do with recycling our water supply.

## is he here?
bane.

## is something wrong?
no, i'm fine.

## you're gonna see the oracle?
there's no time.

## am i still in charge of our defense system?
of course.

## then why did you allow the nebuchadnezzar to leave?
because i believe our survival depends on more than how many ships we have.

## who are you?
i am seraph.

## apologize for what?
for this.

## of what?
that you are the one.

## these are back doors, aren't they?
programmer access.

## how do they work?
a code is hidden in tumblers.

## then what are you?
i protect that which matters most.

## how do you feel?
i...

## you're not human, are you?
it's tough to get more obvious than that.

## ... how can i trust you?
bingo.

## do you already know if i'll take it?
wouldn't be much of an oracle if i didn't.

## but if you already know, how can i make a choice?
because you didn't come here to make the choice.

## why are you here?
same reason.

## but why help us?
we're all here to do what we're all here to do.

## are there other programs like you?
well, not like me, but...

## see those birds?
at some point, a program was written to govern them.

## why?
they have their reasons...... but usually a program chooses exile when it faces deletion.

## and why would a program be deleted?
maybe it breaks down.

## what happens when you go through the door?
i see trinity...... and something happens...... something bad.

## do you see her die?
no.

## then why can't i see what happens to her?
we can never see past the choices we don't understand.

## are you saying i have to choose whether trinity lives or dies?
no, you've already made the choice.

## why?
because you're the one.

## what happens if i fail?
then zion will fall.

## the keymaker?
he disappeared.

## what do all men with power want?
more power.

## did you get my package?
yeah.

## smith?
he's not reading like an agent.

## surprised to see me?
no.

## of what?
our connection.

## and what reason is that?
i killed you, mr. anderson.

## what's happening to him?
don't know.

## are you all right?
it was smith.

## now there's more than one of them?
a lot more.

## how is that possible?
i don't know.

## is that what he was doing to you?
i don't know what he was doing...

## what?
it felt like i was back in that hallway.

## are there two among you that would answer such a call?
captain soren of the vigilant will answer the council's call.

## you understand the situation, captain soren?
yes, ma'am.

## is there another?
captain, i think we should volunteer.

## what?
you have gone crazy.

## is there no other?
be hard for any man to risk his life...... especially if he doesn't understand the reason.

## what?
thank you, captain niobe.

## niobe, what are you doing?
what i can.

## why?
because some things never change, jason...... and some things do.

## what can you see, neo?
it's strange.

## encrypted?
maybe.

## is that good for us or bad for us?
well, it looks like every floor is wired with explosives.

## right?
and the legendary morpheus.

## drink?
of course, such things are contrivances, like so much here.

## but then, if we do not ever take time, how can we ever have time?
chteau haut briond, 1959.

## you see?
it's like wiping your ass with silk.

## the question is, do you know why you are here?
we are looking for the keymaker.

## ... what?
you know the answer to that question.

## but do you?
you think you do, but you do not.

## you can see it, neo, yes?
she does not understand why.

## is it the wine?
no.

## what is the reason?
and soon it does not matter.

## where are you going?
please, ma chrie, i have told you.

## are you certain the oracle didn't say anything else?
yes.

## how do you know?
we are still alive.

## what?
a kiss.

## excuse me?
i want you to kiss me as if you were kissing her.

## why?
you love her.

## and the commandant has a plan to stop 250. 000 sentries?
a strategy is still tracing.

## what do you believe that we should make morfeo?
i believe that we should...

## what does it happen?
however...

## do you understand what you are requesting?
i am requesting that a ship remain here, in our place, only just in case the oracle he/ she tries to contact us.

## and what it will happen when you return to zion and does the commandant throw you to a cell?

## trinity?
i am well.

## do you take these?
yes, clear link.

## how?
neo.

## is something happening, not?
something big.

## what would it recommend?
the truth.

## why is it so sure?
consider what we have seen councilman...

## are you thinking the same thing that me?
yes, if you think that this elevator is too slow.

## now... we will have that to work together, well?
we go boys, hour of leaving.

## you careful with her, yes?
don't worry about my, he is who will receive it.

## what will i receive?
anyone of the other ships has been in he/ she marries two or three times more than the nebuchadnezzar.

## why?
you know why.

## you believe that cass thinks that it is fair that i am here and dozer not?
that ship was taken at two of my siblings link.

## how can you tell me that?
by morfeo, for what told me.

## have they already begun?
only the introductory sentence of the councilman hamann.

## neo...
why?

## what does it happen?
it is well, you can be.

## do you feel this?
i will never allow it to go.

## are you well?
i will resist.

## did you dress that agent?
he/ she had never seen something like that.

## would it please you some company?
councilman hamann.

## what are there of you?
i have not been able to...... dormir a lot.

## of what?
that after everything, you are human.

## you have gone at some time to the one engineering level?
he/ she loved to walk somewhere around in the night.

## would you like to see it?
clear.

## interesting, not?
the power of giving life.

## what is the control?
if we wanted, we would rot to turn off these machines.

## is that control, not?
if we wanted, we would rot to break them in pieces.

## is that the point councilman?
no, it is not the point.

## that is the reason for the one that there is not young in the council?
good point.

## why he/ she doesn't tell me that that does he/ she have in mind councilman?
there are so many things in this world...... que doesn't understand.

## do you see that machine?
he/ she has something to do with the reciclaje of our provision of water.

## is it here?
take a bath.

## does it happen you something?
no, i am well.

## will you see to the oracle, not?
we don't have time.

## councilman, i am still to position of our defensive system?
of course.

## then why it allowed that the nebuchadnezzar left?
because i think that our survival not it only depends of how many ships we have.

## hello?
searches to the oracle.

## who are?
i am seraph.

## to apologize why?
for this reason...

## of what?
that you are the elect.

## where devils did he/ she leave?
accesses to programs.

## how do they work?
a position opens a lock.

## then what you are?
i protect that that more it cares.

## how do you feel?
me...

## why don't you come and do you sit down?
maybe better it is stopped.

## you are not human, or yes?
it is difficult to become more obvious than that.

## how can i trust you?
you guessed right.

## do you already know if i will take it?
it would not be an oracle if he/ she didn't know it.

## how can i make an election?
because you didn't come to my to make the election ; you have already made it.

## why are you here?
same reason.

## but why to help us?
we all are here to make what we all have to make.

## are there more programs as you?
no, i don't eat, but...

## do you see those birds?
in a certain point a program it was written to govern them.

## why?
there are reasons, but usually a program elije the exile when he/ she faces to be erased.

## and why would it be erased a program?
maybe because it works bad, maybe another program better you cre in its substitution, happens the whole time.

## in your dreams, or not?
the door made of light.

## what does it happen when you cross the door?
i see trinity.

## do you see it die?
no.

## then why i am not able to to see what happens him?
we cannot see those first elections that we don't understand.

## you are saying that i have that to choose if trinity will live or not?
no.

## why?
because you are the elect.

## what does it happen if i fail?
then zion will succumb.

## the locksmith?
yes, it disappeared a while ago, and not we knew what it had passed him up to now.

## what it is what you/ they want all the men with being able to?
more power.

## did he/ she receive my package?
yes.

## surprised of seeing me?
no.

## of what?
our connection.

## and what reason is that?
i killed him mr. anderson, and i saw it die.

## what is it passing him?
i don't know it.

## are you well?
he/ she was smith.

## how is it possible?
i don't know it.

## is that what was making you?
i don't know what he/ she was making.

## what?
i felt as if it was again in that corridor.

## there are two among you that will they respond such a call?
captain sorren, of the vigilant, he/ she responds to the call of the council.

## you understand the situation captain sorren?
yes mrs...

## is there some other one?
i believe that we should offer.

## have you become crazy?
he/ she closes the mouth he/ she took a bath.

## there is not any other one?
it is difficult for any man to take a risk their life, especially if he/ she doesn't understand the reason.

## what?
thank you captain niobe.

## niobe, what are you making?
what i can.

## why?
because some things jason never changes.

## what can you see neo?
it is strange, the code is different somehow.

## encrypted?
maybe.

## it is that good or bad for us?
it seemed that each floor it is wired with explosive.

## can i help them?
yes, we have come to to speak with the merovingio.

## neo, the elect in person... certain?
and the legendary morfeo.

## something to eat, to drink?
of course that they are only formalities, as many of the things of here, to save the appearances.

## but if we cannot make ourselves a time to receive, how will we be able to have a time to take?
chateau aubry 1959.

## the question is, you know why are they here?
we look for the locksmith.

## the locksmith's nature is to be a means, not an end...... entonces to look for it is to be looking for a means for...... hacer... what?
you know the answer to that question.

## but do you know it?
you believe to know it, but it is not this way.

## it is not fabulous?
my god, only see it.

## sir, are you sure about this?
i told you, we're going to be all right.

## yes, sir?
given your situation, i can't say i understand your reasons...... for volunteering to operate onboard my ship.

## what's that, sir?
to trust me.

## you wanna talk?
they're just dreams.

## are we ready to go?
we're already late.

## how fast are they moving?
control estimates their descent at 100 meters an hour.

## how deep are they?
almost 2000 meters.

## what about the scans from the osiris?
they can't be accurate.

## why not?
a sentinel for every man, woman and child in zion.

## what are we gonna do?
we're gonna do what commander lock ordered.

## and does the commander have a plan for stopping 250, 000 sentinels?
a strategy is still being formulated.

## what do you think we should do, morpheus?
we should proceed as ordered...

## what is it?
i don't know.... however, i must ask one of you for help.

## do you understand what you're asking?
i am asking that one ship remain here in our place...... in case the oracle should attempt to contact us.

## what happens when you get back to zion...... and the commander throws you in the stockade?
he won't.

## how did you know someone was here?
he gave you this.

## is everything all right, sir?
the meeting is over.

## agents?
go.

## do we proceed?
yes.

## what happened?
i can't figure it out.

## okay?
shit, you should've seen him.

## where is he now?
he's doing his superman thing.

## where are you?
this is the nebuchadnezzar, requesting access through gate three.

## are you here to escort me to the stockade, captain?
i'm just here to keep the peace.

## sir?
i want the ship ready to go as soon as possible.

## morpheus and lock?
niobe.

## captain niobe?
she used to be with morpheus.

## what happened?
morpheus went to the oracle.

## doesn't he have anything better to do?
you know what they say about the life you save.

## can i carry that for you?
no, i can carry my own bag.

## trinity?
i'm fine.

## hey, you know, next year i'm old enough to join a crew, right?
i've been thinking about it, and i've made my decision.

## how?
neo.

## something big is happening, isn't it?
hey.

## what would you advise?
the truth.

## what makes you so sure?
consider what we have seen, councillor.

## are you thinking what i'm thinking?
i am if you're thinking this elevator is too slow.

## how long do we charge the neb?
twenty four, maybe 30 hours.

## okay?
all right.

## what are you feeding these two?
every ship up there's been home two, even three times more than the nebuchadnezzar.

## why?
you know why.

## you think cas thinks it's fair that i'm here and dozer's not?
i lost two brothers to that ship, link.

## how can you say that to me?
because of morpheus.

## they started yet?
only councillor hamann's opening prayer.

## follow me.
why?

## what's wrong?
it's okay, you can tell me.

## you feel this?
i'm never letting go.

## you all right?
i'll make it.

## did you see that agent?
i've never seen anything like that.

## care for some company?
councillor hamann.

## what about you?
i just haven't been able to sleep much.

## of what?
that you are in fact still human.

## have you ever been to the engineering level?
i love to walk there at night.

## would you like to see it?
sure.

## interesting, isn't it?
the power to give life...

## the idea is pure nonsense...... but it does make one wonder just...... what is control?
if we wanted, we could shut these machines down.

## that's control, isn't it?
if we wanted, we could smash them to bits.

## is that your point, councillor?
no.

## is that why there are no young men on the council?
good point.

## see that machine?
it has something to do with recycling our water supply.

## ls he here?
bane.

## is something wrong?
no, i'm fine.

## you're gonna see the oracle?
there's no time.

## am i still in charge of our defense system?
of course.

## then why did you allow the nebuchadnezzar to leave?
because i believe our survival depends on more than how many ships we have.

## who are you?
i am seraph.

## apologize for what?
for this.

## of what?
that you are the one.

## these are back doors, aren't they?
programmer access.

## how do they work?
a code is hidden in tumblers.

## then what are you?
i protect that which matters most.

## so...... let's get the obvious stuff out of the way.
you turned out all right, didn't you?

## you're not human, are you?
it's tough to get more obvious than that.

## ... how can i trust you?
bingo.

## do you already know if i'll take it?
wouldn't be much of an oracle if i didn't.

## but if you already know, how can i make a choice?
because you didn't come here to make the choice.

## why are you here?
same reason.

## but why help us?
we're all here to do what we're all here to do.

## are there other programs like you?
well, not like me, but....

## see those birds?
at some point, a program was written to govern them.

## why?
they have their reasons...... but usually a program chooses exile when it faces deletion.

## and why would a program be deleted?
maybe it breaks down.

## what happens when you go through the door?
i see trinity...... and something happens...... something bad.

## do you see her die?
no.

## then why can't i see what happens to her?
we can never see past the choices we don't understand.

## are you saying i have to choose whether trinity lives or dies?
no, you've already made the choice.

## why?
because you're the one.

## what happens if i fail?
then zion will fall.

## the keymaker?
he disappeared.

## what do all men with power want?
more power.

## did you get my package?
yeah.

## smith?
he's not reading like an agent.

## surprised to see me?
no.

## of what?
our connection.

## and what reason is that?
i killed you, mr. anderson.

## what's happening to him?
don't know.

## are you all right?
it was smith.

## now there's more than one of them?
a lot more.

## how is that possible?
i don't know.

## ls that what he was doing to you?
i don't know what he was doing...

## what?
it felt like i was back in that hallway.

## are there two among you that would answer such a call?
captain soren of the vigilant will answer the council's call.

## you understand the situation, captain soren?
yes, ma'am.

## is there another?
captain, i think we should volunteer.

## what?
you have gone crazy.

## is there no other?
be hard for any man to risk his life...... especially if he doesn't understand the reason.

## what?
thank you, captain niobe.

## niobe, what are you doing?
what i can.

## why?
because some things never change, jason...... and some things do.

## what can you see, neo?
it's strange.

## encrypted?
maybe.

## is that good for us or bad for us?
well, it looks like every floor is wired with explosives.

## right?
and the legendary morpheus.

## drink?
of course, such things are contrivances, like so much here.

## but then, if we do not ever take time, how can we ever have time?
chteau haut briond, 1959.

## you see?
it's like wiping your ass with silk.

## the question is, do you know why you are here?
we are looking for the keymaker.

## ... what?
you know the answer to that question.

## but do you?
you think you do, but you do not.

## you can see it, neo, yes?
she does not understand why.

## is it the wine?
no.

## what is the reason?
and soon it does not matter.

## where are you going?
please, ma chrie, i have told you.

## are you certain the oracle didn't say anything else?
yes.

## how do you know?
we are still alive.

## what?
a kiss.

## excuse me?
i want you to kiss me as if you were kissing her.

## why?
you love her.

## why don't you sample this instead?
trinity.

## why should we trust you?
if i don't deliver you to the keymaker, she can kill me.

## aren't you, boys?
yes, mistress.

## how many people keep silver bullets in their gun?
you betray me.

## cause?
there is no cause for this.

## lipstick?
lipstick.

## i'll handle them.
what craziness are you talking about, woman?

## you'll handle us?
you know, your predecessors had much more respect.

## you see?
ask jacinto to prepare the carriage.

## bu why this public confession?
i must settle my accounts with god and mankind.

## as they say,
what does your wife think about this?

## it seems i'm disturbing you.
so, how much are you charging me?

## aren't you going to introduce me?
i think i'm dreaming.

## indifferent, eh?

## and when he came back, holding the man in his arms, whom do i see?
jos silveira.

## what paper was that you hid so quickly?
my dear ivaro.

## when you are less drunk.
why were you at the newspaper?

## and once he had no choice but to have him whipped.

## if he were still alive, what wouldn't he do to you?
you're drunker and more vulgar than any coachman.

## and if we're found, jacinto?
don't worry.

## for what?
to be a good daughter.

## don't you want to go home, and forget this villain, who is the cause of our misfortunes?
no, father.

## not even here am i free from your hateful presence?
i am one of the servants that my cousin takes with her.

## who knows?
maybe forever.

## yes or no?
you know it's true, master.

## it's a big world and one can live anywhere.
what would you say if i offered her hand to you?

## what about my father?
i'm afraid.

## who is that with her?
i think it's jacinto, master.

## silvestre's coachman?
i think so.

## you think so, or you are sure?
it is him, master.

## do you want the girl, or not?
that's settled.

## i knew you weren't a man to leave business unfinished.

## the fish faces?
bingo.

## uh, x. r.?
slight problem.

## kind of reminds ya of yourself, huh?
yeah, kind of.

## uh, hello?
yeah, buddy.

## what are you doing here?
we want answers and we want them now.

## how's that?
it's headed toward star command.

## what happened?
i mean, there's no sign ofa struggle.

## zurg?
in a manner ofspeaking.

## anybody got a plan?
here's one.

## then how do we get past them?
looks like we've got us... a high traffic area.

## and robot?
and robot.

## what do we do?
we've got to take the battle to zurg.

## evil juggling?
farewell, lightyear.

## but why?
perfect.

## okay, and you are?
in serious need ofsome personal space.

## so, buzz, did zurg win?
not a chance, booster.

## yeah?
well, wherever he is, i'll bet he's got legroom.

## the defeat ofstar command?
i always knew it was doable.

## so nobody's ever actually infiltrated planet z before?
never.

## what button?
let me see.

## that?
that's not a spacecraft.

## let's leave the brain work to those with the brains, shall we?
uh huh.

## what what about zurg?
he's my problem.

## incidentally, why can't we have nose rings?
because nose rings are for punks, little mister.

## next target, and oh.
then who's getting a nose ring?

## who haven't we perverted into a twisted reflection of my evil?
a few planets in the beta quadrant remain unperverted.

## or am i dead?
no, you're not dead.

## but how?
the exploding moon.

## convincing, wasn't it?
yeah, zurg's fireworks are really top shelf.

## who's surprised here?
one ofstar command's finest, the perfect spy.

## buzz lightyear mission log, final entry.
miss him now?

## what's he doing?
mission log.

## did i sit on another button?
it's buzz.

## doom?

## are you crazy?
buddy boy, we're on thejanitorial staff.

## mm kay, buzz, what are we going to actually do?
the l. g. m. mindlink was activated by a simple touch.

## okay.
you're gonna ghost me?

## got the message, guys.
you know what?

## so, who's your partner gonna be, son?
don't worry, commander.

## how can that be?
it's under attack, sustaining damage.

## what about the gate?
sentinels are inside the dock.

## how many apus are operational?
thirteen, sir.

## what?
you have to open that gate.

## how much time?
two minutes to impact.

## captain mifune, do you copy?
we ain't come this far.

## but some things do?
luckily...... some things do.

## are you kidding?
i'm never gonna take it off.

## did i miss something?
i thought we saved the dock.

## save the dock, captain?
you handed it to them on a silver platter.

## your move.
do you hear that?

## so you gave them your ship?
that is correct, counciilor, i did.

## the oracle said nothing of this?
she told me neo would need my help, and i would choose to help him or not.

## but what hope can a single vessei have against their entire defense system?
none.

## how do you know that?
i can feei them.

## can you see it?
three iines.

## what are they doing?
i don't know.

## lieutenant?
goddamn it.

## what do we do now?
it is now a matter of time.

## how iong do we have?
two hours.

## commander, do you think that we have any chance of surviving?
if i were you, i wouldn't ask me that question.

## why?
he's the one who believes in miracles.

## do you see what's out there?
yes.

## what do we do?
go up, over them.

## trinity?
i'm here.

## where?
here.

## what's wrong?
i can't go with you, neo.

## what?
oh, no.

## do you remember...... on that roof, after you caught me...... the iast thing i said to you?
i wish i hadn't.

## what do you want?
peace.

## and if you fail?
i won't.

## you iike what i've done with the place?
it ends tonight.

## can you feei it, mr. anderson...... closing in on you?
oh, i can.

## could it be for iove?
iilusions, mr. anderson.

## why do you persist?
because i choose to.

## what did i just say?
it's a trick.

## is it over?
sir, he did it, sir.

## did what?
he ended the war.

## is this real?
neo, wherever you are...... thank you.

## just how iong do you think this peace is going to iast?
as iong as it can.

## what others?
the ones that want out.

## beautiful.
i have your word?

## did you do that?
for neo.

## wiii we ever see him again?
i suspect so.

## did you always know?
oh, no.

## should we try to contact them?
won't matter.

## any change?
no.

## how is he?
he's gonna be fine.

## what do you mean?
captain has some questions for him.

## you see these cuts?
i think they're self inflicted.

## why?
vdts maybe.

## for what?
for neo.

## how could he be in the matrix, sir?
he's not plugged in.

## what?
his neural patterns don't read like someone who's in a coma.

## where?
on someone jacked in.

## how long?
based on point of entry and the past speed, the machines will be in zion in 20 hours.

## what?
operator.

## who are you?
my name is sati.

## where am i?
this is the train station.

## this isn't the matrix?
that's where the train goes.

## why not?
he won't let you.

## who won't?
the trainman.

## who are you?
i'm the oracle.

## what happened?
i made a choice, and that choice cost me more than i wanted it to.

## what choice?
to help you, to guide neo.

## do you know what happened to neo?
yes.

## why?
because of who the trainman works for.

## after everything that has happened, how can you expect me to believe you?
i don't.

## are you from the matrix?
yes.

## why did you leave?
i had to.

## what are you doing here?
you do not belong here.

## who's the trainman?
he works for the frenchman.

## why did i know you would say that?
the frenchman does not forget, and he does not forgive.

## you know him?
i know only what i need to know.

## is that what you're doing here?
rama, please.

## can you tell me what you would give to hold on to that connection?
it is already late.

## you think it has something to do with me?
i cannot say.

## who knows such things?
only the oracle.

## you know the oracle?
everyone knows the oracle.

## you're not staying with her?
it is not possible.

## why?
that is our karma.

## you believe in karma?
karma is a word, like love.

## can i carry that for you?
he is a friend.

## and if we're unlucky?
there will be many men.

## can i take your?
oh, my god.

## what in the hell?
i don't believe this.

## tell me, how many bullets are there in those guns?
i don't know, but i don't think you have enough.

## yes?
i'll tell you what i will do.

## all three of us?
oh, yes, yes.

## and since you, my little judas, have brought them here...... i can only surmise that the fortuneteller has found herself another shell?
disappointing, but not unexpected.

## come now, what kind of question is this?
of course i know.

## do you know?
no.

## no?
i did not think so.

## but it is always best to ask, huh?
we want to make a deal.

## always straight to business, huh, morpheus?
okay.

## to make a deal...... you must have something i want, yes?
and it so happens there is something i want.

## what?
the eyes of the oracle.

## no?
i don't have time for this shit.

## how about this?
you give me neo, or we all die, right here, right now.

## you are really ready to die for this man?
believe it.

## what's it gonna be, merv?
okay.

## are you ready for us?
almost, sir.

## can't you see him?
no, sir.

## now?
it's my last chance.

## why?
cookies need love like everything does.

## so do you recognize me?
a part of you.

## remember how you were when you first walked through my door?
jittery as a june bug.

## where does it end?
i don't know.

## you don't know or you won't tell me?
i told you before...... no one can see beyond a choice they don't understand, and i mean no one.

## what choice?
it doesn't matter.

## does that include what things to tell me and what not to?
of course not.

## why didn't you tell me the truth?
because it wasn't time for you to know.

## who decided it wasn't time?
you know who.

## where?
the source.

## why not?
he doesn't understand them.

## what's your purpose?
to unbalance it.

## what do you want?
i want the same thing you want, neo.

## is it going to end?
one way or another.

## can zion be saved?
i'm sorry, i don't have the answer to that question, but....

## where?
you know where.

## what does that mean?
everything that has a beginning...... has an end.

## what is he?
he is you.

## and if i can't stop him?
one way or another, neo...... this war is going to end.

## are you all right?
i need time.

## what's up, maggie?
bane is.

## can i come back?
i would like to come back.

## what did she say about me?
that you were a bad man.

## i suppose you've been expecting me, right?
the all knowing oracle is never surprised.

## how can she be?
she knows everything.

## why wouldn't she leave?
maybe you knew i would do that, maybe you didn't.

## what did you do with sati?
cookies need love like everything does.

## what about the cuts on your arms?
those cuts are more than one day old.

## but why would i do something like that to myself?
unless, of course, i wasn't myself.

## has this man been tested for vdts?
yes, sir.

## the logos?
yes, sir.

## are the thermals picking up any signs of life?
no, sir.

## what about the ship?
holographic says the hull's still intact.

## what was that?
you can put that shit away, boys.

## are you all right?
yes, i'm fine.

## did you get neo out?
yes.

## how did you know about that?
the oracle.

## you saw her?
just before the sentinels found us.

## what did she tell you?
the same thing she always does.

## precisely what size force are you planning to commit to the primary dock objective?
right now, the entire apu corps and half the infantry.

## half the infantry?
lf it were up to me, councillor...... i'd take every man, woman and child, put a gun in their hand...... and march them into that dock.

## has there been word from the nebuchadnezzar?
none, and at this point there's no reason to expect there will be.

## zee, what are you doing?
making shells.

## what?
they've called for volunteers to hold the dock.

## why?
because i love him.

## but ask yourself, if it were dozer...... and you knew the only chance you had to see him was to hold the dock...... what would you do?
make shells.

## what the shit is going on over here?
an accident, sir.

## who the hell are you?
a unit volunteer, sir.

## what's a pod born pencil neck like you doing volunteering for my corps?
i want to do my part, sir.

## how old are you, kid?
eighteen.

## you want to reload the operations software, sparky?
yeah.

## could you clean the windshield while you're at it?
uplinks in place.

## so what?
you'll be the only one that can.

## sure of what?
i know what i have to do.

## what?
there's no easy way to say this, so i'll just say it.

## to go where?
to the machine city.

## is this what the oracle has told you?
no.

## sounds like providence, doesn't it, morpheus?
you've never believed in the one.

## then why are you doing this?
i believe in him.

## what's that for?
to help you relax.

## if i did that...... it wouldn't be very safe for me here, would it?
of course, it might not be very safe for you either.

## do you know what's changed in the last six hours?
no.

## you're not leaving them anything?
he said he didn't need it.

## ready?
engine's still firing.

## what are you talking about?
i think i might enjoy killing you as much as killing him.

## what if they need our help?
it's too dangerous.

## why?
because if he's killed them...... he'll control another emp.

## what?
he's out of his mind.

## confused, mr. anderson?
it'll all become clear in a moment.

## we've been here before, you and i, remember?
i do.

## still don't recognize me?
i admit, it is difficult to even think encased in this rotting piece of meat.

## what do you want?
shit, yeah.

## how far to the opening?
1. 4 kilometers.

## christ, there's a shitstorm of them.
where the hell's my infantry?

## you see that?
they're after the radio.

## what?
i think it's one of ours, sir.

## would you like to see how i've treated it?
i can hardly wait.

## just what do you mean by that?
oh, come now, watson.

## really?
the fact is, i could barely hold my own... in the pit orchestra of a second rate music hall.

## don't you think i'm aware you've been diluting it... behind my back?
as a doctor, as well as your friend...

## did you say midgets?
mmm, six of them.

## well, don't you find that intriguing?
extremely so.

## anarchists?
by now they have been smuggled to vienna... dressed as little girls in organdy pinafores.

## you really think so?
there is something missing from my desk.

## missing?
something very crucial.

## why don't you let me air the room out?
please, mrs. hudson, he's working on... a definitive study of tobacco ash.

## you do?
it's placid, imperturbable, prosaic.

## holmes... where's your self control?
fair question.

## aren't you ashamed of yourself?
thoroughly... but this will take care of it.

## why won't you go?
it's the final performance of the lmperial russian ballet.

## why should someone send us two free tickets?
anonymously, at that.

## you mean, somebody wants to lure us into a trap?
somebody wants to kill me.

## kill you?
that's right.

## who?
the great petrova.

## really?
six committed suicide... four were killed in duels... and one fell out of the gallery... of the vienna opera house.

## yes?
i am nikolai rogozhin...

## you're enjoying?
lmmensely.

## my health?
better consult my doctor.

## would you mind telling me what this is all about?
certainly.

## can you be more specific?
certainly not.

## blackmail?
after performance... there will be little celebration backstage... and madame requests your presence.

## no girls?
no caviar.

## oh, i didn't mean to be.
any of your girls understand english?

## short, tall, who cares?
it is the brains that count.

## what is your opinion of this?
antonius stradivarius, cremonensis...

## you like?
oh, it's magnificent.

## mine?
for services you will render.

## oh, is he missing?
correct.

## because without father, how could there be child?
red pepper.

## i beg your pardon?
madame would like to know when you can be ready.

## ready?
to leave for venice.

## why?
we don't know.

## because tchaikovsky how shall i put it?
women... not his glass of tea.

## so?
you know what they say about us.

## huh?
we're all bleeders.

## you find her attractive or no?
well, i...

## i am?
thank you.

## you find madame attractive or no?
oh, i find her most attractive... for a woman, that is.

## not free?
but you are bachelor.

## you mean you and dr. watson...
what is it you are trying to tell us?

## he... is your glass of tea?
lf you want to be picturesque about it.

## ... tchaikovsky?
believe me, madame, the loss is all mine.

## what is it, old boy?
we're going home.

## home?
not a chance.

## what way?
oh, you don't have to pretend.

## about me and him?
come on.

## what is?
from the sound of your footsteps...

## what the deuce were you thinking of?
watson, you have my most abject apologies.

## but have you ever been cornered by a madwoman?
it seemed like the only way to get out of it... without hurting her feelings.

## you realize the gravity of what you've done... the possible repercussions?
so there'll be a little gossip about you... in st. petersburg.

## what am i to do?
well, for one thing, i'd get rid of that flower.

## can you, holmes?
good night, watson.

## i hope i'm not being presumptuous... but there have been women in your life?
the answer is yes... you're being presumptuous.

## was there some secret he was holding back... or was he just a thinking machine... incapable of any emotion?
i was not to get the answer... until we became involved in what i considered to be... the most outrageous case in all our years together.

## were you expecting someone?
not at this hour.

## what is it, mrs. hudson?
there's a cabby here, says you owe him two and six.

## for what?
for the fare, governor.

## what young lady?
this one.

## what happened to you?
i don't know.

## where did she come from?
from the river.

## why did you bring her here?
because i found this in her hand.

## young lady, what did you want at this address?
i do not remember.

## rather perplexing, wouldn't you say?
rather.

## or shall i throw her back in the river?
oh, mr. holmes, you can't let him do that.

## could she have hit her head when she fell... or jumped into the river?
no.

## who are you?
i'm dr. watson... and this is sherlock holmes.

## do the names mean anything to you?
no.

## can you think of your own name?
no.

## namely?
something i deduced... when i was helping her up the stairs.

## vous etes francaise?
non.

## vous etes suisse?
non.

## alors, vous etes belge?
je ne suis pas sur.

## vous etes belge, de bruxelles?
we just found out she's belgian.

## gabrielle?
i don't know.

## and your husband's name is emile?
emile.

## what are you doing in london?
i don't know.

## there's already been one attempt on her life.
when did you arrive from brussels?

## this temporary amnesia, how temporary is it?
it depends on the extent of her injury.

## don't you find that challenging?
quite... but we can't afford to wait for these veils to lift.

## you really feel it's that urgent?
i do.

## emile?
emile.

## ls that you, emile?
yes, gabrielle.

## what?
i hope you're not going to be angry with me.

## did you?
a pink negligee with marabou feathers.

## don't you think it's a little bit foolish... for a married woman?
come on.

## where is the negligee?
ln my luggage.

## and where is your luggage?
oh, i don't know.

## what are you doing?
dr. watson.

## mrs. hudson, would you mind... planting your knee in the small of my back?
yes, i would.

## as a matter of fact, i did take advantage of her.
gone?

## would you hand me the butter knife, please?
of course.

## you did what?
thank you.

## have you no sense of decency, no shame?
none whatsoever.

## remember that piece of soggy cardboard... with our address on it?
it was a luggage ticket.

## what else is in here?
now we're getting somewhere.

## who do you suppose this is?
good morning, madame valladon.

## you are gabrielle valladon?
yes.

## where am l?
221 b baker street.

## which one of you is sherlock holmes... and which is dr. watson?
dr. watson is the handsome one.

## you came to london looking for your husband, right?
yes.

## how did you know?
your wedding ring it's made of copper.

## emile?
never.

## do you have any idea who could've done it?
i don't understand any of it.

## where is my husband?
you must help me find him.

## ashdown street what was that number?
thirty two.

## what do you want me to say in the letter?
nothing.

## holmes... you're sending an empty sheet of paper... to an empty shop?
that empty shop is obviously being used... as an accommodation address or letter drop.

## the question is how and by whom... and why?
hammer.

## suppose this could've been a pet shop?
maybe.

## mr. holmes?
mm hmm.

## what does it mean?
i would surmise somebody was using ice skates... if it weren't for a conspicuous absence of ice.

## what do we do now?
this way.

## you think i'd forgotten you?
yeah.

## what do you think?
taking dancing lessons.

## how many do you want this time?
two dozen.

## what's going on up there?
now, duchess, we don't know, and we don't want to know.

## does that go, too?
no.

## right, you got it?
wait.

## and where is up there?
my guess would be scotland...

## didn't you notice the paper at the bottom of their cage?
the lnverness courier.

## what about it?
it is addressed to you.

## to me?
but that's impossible.

## what time do you make it, watson?
11:43.

## how's your gout?
under control, except for an occasional twinge.

## why are you wasting this precious stuff on us?
i see you so rarely.

## how long has it been?
not since the, uh, case of the greek interpreter.

## lsn't it ridiculous?
two brothers, living in the same town.

## how old did you say it was?
why, it's...

## it's in belgium, isn't it?
quite.

## for any particular reason?
because it involves the national security.

## who's we?
the diogenes club, of course.

## yes, wiggins?
an immediate answer is requested, sir.

## why don't you crumple it up and swallow it... just to make sure?
my dear sherlock, there are certain affairs... that do not come within the province... of the private detective.

## by whose authority?
by the authority of her majesty's government.

## watson, what does the word glennahurich... suggest to you?
absolutely nothing.

## ls it?
open that door.

## did you ever try doing embroidery... with a gun in your hand?
you'll be relieved to know it was not loaded.

## holmes, are you planning to disobey mycroft's orders?
he's not just your brother, you know.

## did you find out anything?
let's just say i know what the next step will be.

## yes?
i want you to pack your things.

## at 7:30 this evening, dr. watson and i... are going to take you to victoria station... and put you on the boat train.
where are we going?

## the boat train?
oh, that's better.

## are you quite finished?
lf you recall, what i said was that... we were going to put you on the boat train.

## she's not?
at 7:30, mr. holmes and dr. watson... will be seen waving good bye to madame valladon... at victoria station.

## you don't like me very much, do you?
nothing of the sort.

## looking for something?
yes.

## am i embarrassing you, mr. holmes?
not at all.

## oh?
a very interesting case in a harem in constantinople.

## going to scotland, you gentlemen?
so are we.

## ever been there?
beautiful country.

## you must be one of those orders that's taken the vow of silence?
trappists, i think you're called.

## what did you say?
i didn't say it.

## oh?
it was one of those passionate affairs... at odd hours right in my laboratory.

## your... fiancee?
she was the daughter of my violin teacher.

## how far is it?
glennahurich...

## why do you want to go there?
well, it sounds like a nice, peaceful place... for a picnic.

## why not?
i would think so.

## working you hard, dad?
no, not really.

## what happened?
an accident, aye.

## local people?
no, no.

## what do you believe?
well, you may think i'm an old fool... an old drunk, but...

## are you trying to tell us it was the monster?
damn right.

## ls it?
last easter sunday, the wife and me... on our way to services, when suddenly...

## ah, what's the use?
here you are, dad.

## lf they're unidentified graves... why are those boys bringing flowers?
because it's their brothers who have just been buried.

## their brothers?
and they're not boys.

## pebbles?
take a look at their faces.

## they are... how do you call them in english?
not at all.

## do you remember a tumbling act six brothers missing from the circus?
that case you turned down.

## hand me that lantern.
the question now is, who's in the third grave?

## it is valladon, isn't it?
obviously... but what is not so obvious... is why his wedding ring has turned green... and why there are three dead canaries in the coffin.

## may i have your wedding ring, please?
the monster.

## there, there.
the monster?

## see it?
there.

## see it?
i see nothing.

## nothing?
it's gone.

## gone?
maybe it was never there.

## asphyxiation?
there's only one substance... that can turn a copper ring green... and bleach the color out of canaries chlorine gas.

## you call yourself logical?
you're the least logical man i know.

## am l?
how can you say it's a figment of my imagination... when for years you've been saying...

## would you like some more cranberry sauce, dear?
yes, dear.

## would you pass the cranberry sauce, john?
there's some chaps i met on the train.

## trappists, you know?
just study their bibles.

## lsn't that odd?
quite.

## it's just a pile of rubble.
what is it, dear?

## why, indeed?
let's go.

## go where?
when rebuffed at the front door... one's only choice is to try the tradesman's entrance.

## are you the guide here?
yes, but the castle is closed to the public... while work is going on.

## oh, what are they doing?
it's being restored by the society... for the preservation of scottish monuments.

## about 1400, wasn't it?
that's right.

## let me see, was it built by james ll or james ill?

never without it.

## what is it?

## but would you believe you can't borrow... a decent pair of trousers in this place?
all right, holmes.

## want to confide in us?
whenever he starts whistling...

## where?
at the ballet.

## an engine?
the stethoscope is a very sensitive instrument... and water is an excellent conductor of sound.

## you think my husband was involved in all this?
yes, madame valladon, i'm sure of it.

## just to scare people?
not very likely.

## those are my instructions.
why did they try to keep me from finding my husband?

## deliver it where?
i wouldn't know, sir... but there's a carriage waiting for you downstairs.

## are you sure you've got the right mr. ashdown?
quite sure, mr. holmes.

## well... who's minding the castle?
you'd better get on.

j. w. ferguson, naval architect.

## are you engaged in one of your fascinating cases... at the moment?
ln a manner of speaking, ma'am.

## dr. watson's account of the case?
i hope never, ma'am.

## and what, may we ask... is the purpose of that hideous gargoyle?
they are, ma'am, but because of the size of the craft... the navy made an exception.

## h. m. s. jonah has been commissioned as a warship.
but where is the glass bottom?

## it can seek out enemy ships... and destroy them with those torpedoes... while remaining completely invisible.
a warship?

## you mean it can fire at other vessels... while under water?
yes, ma'am.

## without any warning?
that is correct, ma'am.

## without showing her colors?
lndeed, ma'am.

## what will scientists think of next?
that's precisely it, ma'am.

## schlos, isn't it?
i think so.

## unten das schlos... or die schlos?
i don't know.

## fraulein hoffmanstal?

## no?
then i shall just have to do it myself.

## it isn't?
it's von hoffmanstal.

## must amuse you, mr. holmes, trappists walking into a trap?
it's more amusing than that.

## you mean you're going to let them have the air pump?
better than that.

## did you say try to?
i would suggest you get your things together.

## i never had you fooled for a moment, did l?
you knew right from the beginning... when the cabby brought me to baker street.

## it's gone?
forever.

## and a bible?
it would seem that someone carelessly loosened... the bolts of the submersible.

## do you know what he's talking about?
fraulein von hoffmanstal.

## germany?
you will be conducted to the swiss/ german border... and be exchanged for one of our agents... a man named lbidson.

oui, monsieur.

## is it true?
yes.

## did hlne?
listen, i can't believe it.

## how is she?
quite calm now.

## is she insane, doctor?
hlne could never have killed her husband.

## did she tell you anything?
nothing, except she killed him and how.

## where is madame delambre?
in the living room.

## you are the police?
inspector charas, madame.

## why?
it's all right, franois.

## madame, would you tell us what happened?
of course, monsieur.

i cannot answer that question.

## how did you kill him?
with the hydraulic press.

## you mean you put your husband under the press?
no, inspector.

## philippe?
yes, philippe.

## they think i'm mad, don't they?
oh, there.

## it's obvious, isn't it?
in spite of what the doctors think, i believe mrs delambre's mind is quite clear.

## how can you say that?
she must be mad.

## what about philippe?
she acts as if the boy were mine and not hers.

## you're in love with her, aren't you?
yes.

## why didn't you marry her?
because she loved my brother.

## why should i do such a thing?

its head is white instead of black and it has a funny sort of leg.

## oh?
i didn't notice it.

## when did you first see that fly, philippe?
the day daddy went away.

## how is she now?
resting quietly, poor lady.

## how are you?
i'm fine.

## how long do flies live?
i don't know.

## did you kill it?
no.

## what is this all about?
you haven't got it or you wouldn't ask.

## you swear you have it?
yes.

## if i tell you, will you promise to destroy it?
i can't do that until i know.

## don't you see?
i was pretending to be mad, for philippe's sake.

## if i tell you, will you tell them?
i only want to help you.

## you promise?
yes.

## hi, daddy.
who's a ticklish boy?

## are you gonna play with us?

## no matter what happens, okay?
we have enemies in our own house.

## do you know any country people?
you're labelled.

## what's that?
that was our lifeline to civilization.

## you mean head office?
anybody.

## what?
you're not armed.

## who told you that?
i'm a marketing trainee.

## why?
so we can have an intimate moment together.

## what?
what i just dug out of you.

## where were you just now?
i was wandering through existenz.

## why won't you let me contact antenna?
they've gotta be going crazy wondering what's happened to you.

## we just ran because we didn't know how many of them there were, right?
don't tell me you've never been fitted.

## you've never played any game?
look.

## or are you not?
sure.

## anything else i can do for you?
well, gas...... you could check your bio port plugs.

## spark plugs?
you heard me.

## now...... that's a sort of hole in your spine, isn't it?
lots of assholes around here, but that's generally it.

## before?
before it was changed by allegra geller.

## did you ever play her game artgod?
one word.

## those are sterilized...... aren't they?
not to worry.

## then why the clean overalls?
it's a mental thing.

## god?
the mechanic.

## that didn't hurt, did it?
i didn't expect that to hurt.

## how many have you done?
three.

## what was going on, gas?
hell...... he's acting like i'm attacking him.

## great.
yeah?

## we don't have to wait for the swelling to go down.
what's going on?

## you wanted to play my game, didn't you?
feels...... cold.

## how come...... bio ports don't get infected?
i mean...... they open right into your body.

## don't you think you could call me ted?
maybe afterwards.

## what do you mean?
i jacked you into my pod and you panicked.

## that's the only version that exists?
it's the only one and it's stuck inside...... and it's your fault.

## why is it my fault?
i'm telling you, i didn't.

## what's going on?
you're worth a lot of money if you're dead.

## what are you talking about?
you know what i'm talking about.

## why did you install a bad port into me?
there's a bonus for killing...... allegra geller's latest game, or whatever it is.

## i mean, don't you ever go to the fucking movies?
i like your script.

## we're going skiing?
look at that huge bug.

## what happens if somebody comes up here and really wants to ski?
nobody actually physically skis anymore.

## are you in danger?
there have been a couple of attempts on my life.

## what did you port into?
pikul's bio port.

## that's what caused all the damage?
it was a flawed installation.

## you see?
looks like an animal in there.

## where do the batteries go?
very funny.

## you're telling me this thing will run off my body's energy?
that's how they work.

## see?
you're humming along already.

## you want that one?
yeah, that one.

## are you sure you want that one?
yes.

## why not?
the graphics on this one are better.

## that one?
that was beautiful.

## that kind of smooth interlacing from place to place?
depends on the style of the game.

## what precisely is the goal of the game that we're playing now?
you have to play the game to find out why you're playing the game.

## ever see anything like this before?
these are delicate.

## will it work with an industry standard bio port?
i'm d'arcy nader.

## is there anything i can be helping you with?
we're just looking.

## who sent you?
it's none of your business who sent us.

## what happened?
i didn't mean to say that.

## it's a kind of schizophrenic feeling, isn't it?
you'll get used to it.

## but should you be saying this in front of him?
look at him.

## what's he doing?
he's gone into a game loop.

## we do, don't we?
i assumed we did.

## nader?
he's not a very well drawn character.

## what happened?
the whole pod just disappeared into your back.

## it's working its way round my spinal cord?
don't panic.

## do you feel anything yet?
no, i don't.

## what the hell was that?
that wasn't me.

## do you feel yours yet?
they'll take care of themselves.

## what if there's danger?

## will she be okay?
she'll be fine.

## you okay about the other night?
yeah, i'm fine.

## have you talked to harry?
he called me.

## you are?
at least i think i am.

## would i know his name, this guy?
you'll think i'm a little girl with a crush.

## but do you think it's true, all the terrible things they say?
not spider man, not a chance in the world.

## has he mentioned me?
yeah.

## what'd he say?
i said....

## and what did you say?
because you feel...... stronger...... and weaker at the same time.

## you said that?
well, something like that.

## what is it?
you were right about m. j. you're right about everything.

## parker?
yeah.

## and how does he feel about her?
he's loved her since the 4th grade.

## i haven't always been there for you, have l?
you're busy.

## can i do anything for you?
you do too much.

## gee, did i say that?
you sure did.

## well, isn't that up to her?
she doesn't really know who i am.

## tell me, would it be so dangerous...... to let mary jane know how much you care?
everybody else knows.

## you there?
i'm just calling to check up on you.

## will you call me when you get in?
all right, well....

## i hope i make it through this...... so i can see peter parker's face one more time.
hello?

## really?
there's only one man who's always been there for me...... who makes me feel...... like i'm more than i ever thought i could be.

## you can't what?
tell you...... everything.

## only a friend...... peter parker?
that's all i have to give.

## who am i?
i'm spider man.

## how was your journey?
many machines on lx.

## oh?
yes.

## why would they want the duke's son killed?
we must have a look at paul atreides, on caladan.

## music, then?
no music.

## what's wrong with gurney?
good.

## the harkonnens are real.
would you really have drawn my blood?

## dr. yueh, do you have any information on the worms of arrakis?
i have obtained a filmbook of a small specimen.

## only?
there have been documented sightings... of worms as large as 450 meters in the deep desert.

## how do the fremen survive there?
we don't know much about the fremen.

## could the spice affect us in other ways?
many dangers exist on arrakis.

## but if it is a trap, then why are we going?
we have our new army.

## why?
something for your father.

## you thought only of a duke's desire for a son?
desires don't come into this.

## how dare you?
my greatest student.

## what about my father?
put your right hand in the box.

## what's in the box?
pain.

## are you suggesting a duke's son is an animal?
let us say i suggest you may be human.

## could he be the one?
maybe.

## but will he be ours to control?
tell me of your home world, usul.

## the bile from the newborn worms of arrakis?
i have heard of it.

## they tried and failed?
they tried and died.

## what about my father?
i heard your talking.

## what does leto say, piter?
i won't tell you who the traitor is... or when we'll attack.

## what have you discovered about the fremen, duncan?
tell me.

## why haven't we heard from you?
my lord, i suspect so much.

## why is the shield not yet up?
sir, we found and removed another sabotage device.

## are you a fremen?
i've been on arrakis... in the service of the emperor long enough for my eyes to change.

## will you give us an explanation of their workings?
well, this is a stillsuit of fremen manufacture, the most efficient type on arrakis.

## who told you how to do that?
no one.

## battle language?
translate it.

## will we see a worm?
where there's spice and spice mining, there are always worms.

## why do they come?
to protect their territory.

## is there a relationship between the worms and the spice?
as i said, they defend the spice sand.

## as to their relationship with the spice, who knows?
my message.

## are you all right?
yes, i'm fine.

## is it wormsign?
yes.

## may i?
calling harvester pad nine.

## who calls pad nine?
don't mention the duke.

## what happens now?
the carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester.

## ordered by whom?
duke leto atreides.

## how many men do you have?
full crew, 26 men.

## what's that you're saying?
nothing.

## where is your son?
i must warn you, you are in great danger.

## what is it doing to me?
second moon.

## am i the one?
a hunter seeker.

## who is operating that thing?
it has to be someone in the palace.

## who are you?
i am the shadout mapes, the housekeeper.

## jessica, what is wrong?
forgive me, my beloved concubine.

## why hold a dream to ascend to a throne through a political marriage?
i should have married you.

## i've brought house atreides down.
what happened?

## why?
i wish to kill a man.

## leto, where are you?
how simple to subdue us.

## what are your orders, piter?
join her.

## you think i don't know what i gained... for my wife?
take him away.

## huh?
i didn't hear anything.

## where is the ducal signet ring?
i must have his ring.

## what did he say?
paul and jessica safe.

## you do not answer?
come closer, baron.

## i'm alive?
yes.

## maybe that small rock.
i'm alive, eh?

## where are we, do you think?
the south polar regions.

## where are my feelings?
i feel for no one.

## why do they want me killed?
it has to be something to do with the spice.

## well, i've just had a waking dream.
but what?

## ls he the one?
you carry my unborn sister in your womb.

## why did it leave?
someone started another thumper.

## what do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
we call that one muad'dib.

## could i be known as paul muad'dib?
you are paul muad'dib.

## where's my doctor?
jessica... our reverend mother is too old.

## but what of my unborn child?
one day, i will have to do this.

## am i the one?
the sleeper must awaken.

## hmm?
muad'dib.

## what happened to you and your men?
muad'dib.

## what are you saying?
muad'dib.

## what?
he's been repeating that name ever since we found him.

## you've no need of your weapons with me, gurney halleck.
muad'dib?

## don't you trust your own eyes?
that's our entire reserves as well.

## they tried and failed?
they tried and died.

## why?
alia.

## stilgar, do we have wormsign?
usul, we have wormsign the likes of which even god has never seen.

## why have you brought me here?
your highness... there must be some mistake.

## paul is muad'dib?
alia keeps pace with the storm.

## the righteous?
there is a harkonnen among you.

## will she deserve my special attentions?
poisoned.

## think of this as a new adventure, the adventure of a lifetime.
and how can this be?

## leaving our home for some dry speck of dust in the middle of nowhere?
you're a duke's son.

## how could i ever forget?
every day i have to eat responsibility for breakfast and duty for dinner.

## why are you afraid of her mother?
pitch of your voice gives you away.

## since when is it permitted to treat the lady jessica as a common servant?
she was a common servant.

## which men?
i don't know.

## you lie.... what else?
sometimes i see strange people worshiping water... and saying a strange name... my name i think.

## and do you know this girl?
no.

## do you know what this is?
it is a test, young atreides.

## a test for what?
put your hand inside and we'll see.

## what's in it?
pain.

## not in the mood?
mood is a thing for cattle and women, young pup.

## they used to be human, didn't they?
until the spice changed them.

## will arrakis be as bad as they say, thufir?
the storms, perhaps.

## who?
that remains my little secret for now.

## what about the other great houses?
they're sure to protest.

## should i, er, persuade some to stay?
no.

## the fremen?
in the deep desert.

## what's he doing?
water seller, milady.

## what's wrong with their eyes?
those are fremen, desert people.

## what is this for?
an old custom, i'm told.

## can i see him?
i have him occupied on official business for the moment.

## right now?
it's time you participate it.

## your name, shadout, it means well dipper, doesn't it?
i was raised in the desert sietches, noble born.

## there is no wife?
i'm his only companion, the mother of his son.

## you are bene gesserit?
yes, i know the ancient tongues.

## could it be possible that she brings the mahdi?
the thing must take its course.

## what about the mining accounts?
the harkonnen spice operation took...... 10 billion solaris out of here every year.

## now, does anyone here still think that the harkonnen have just packed up and left?
gurney, i want you to make contact...... with the smugglers operating in the deep desert.

## what?
i would just love to see the baron's face when he hears of this.

## worthy to be your first born?
they tell me her ambitions tend more to the literary than the political.

## why did we come here, father?
and don't just tell me it's a matter of honor or duty.

## there's more to it, isn't there?
i've never lied to you, son.

## then why don't we call them out?
expose them...... in front of the emperor.

## what if he's one of them?
this is a hard lesson, son.

## one of yours, turok?
harkonnen mercenaries.

## are they trustworthy?
they are fremen.

## why don't we use shields?
shields are useless in the desert.

## you've worn a stillsuit before?
this is the first time.

## someone adjusted it for you?
no, it just seemed the right way to put it on, that's all.

## how many men are there on a mining crew?
as few as possible.

## has anyone ever been lost out this far and survived?
men have walked out of the nearer zones by crossing the rock areas...... where worms seldom go.

## fremen?
fremen.

## and those are the scouts?
yes.

## worm sign?
wherever there is spice, there are worms.

## always?
they defend the spice sands.

## has there been an effort to wipe them out?
too much area to cover.

## where's the carryall to evacuate the harvester?
worm sign, approximately 40 kilometers.

## do they always cut it this close?
it's not standard procedure.

## how many men on that harvester?
usually 23, milord.

## are we sure the worm will attack?
no doubt about it.

## why aren't they coming out?
they are hoping that the carryall will show up at the last minute.

## may he keep the world for his people.
what are they doing?

## how about the men we left behind?
send a ship to search for them.

## what?
paul.

## and what do you deduce from all of this, nephew?
the longer we wait, the harder it will be to dislodge him.

## piter, try again, will you?
leto's continued success makes the other great houses nervous, rabban.

## the slave is quite a specimen this time, don't you think, rabban?
perhaps feyd shouldn't be quite so casual today.

## paul?
these are, uh, simple people, milord.

## tell me...... do the cooks use much spice in our food?
the spice is everywhere on arrakis, milord.

## i was its target?
it goes toward movement, that's all.

## iniative?
you decided to show some initiative.

## now what, piter?
there is, of course, the slight troop transport problem.

## and what would you suggest, my most devious mentat?
offer an increase in spice royalties...... payable in advance from rabban's own reserves...

## hasn't it?
your assassin didn't arrive here without help.

## but who could you suspect?
i can only suspect.

## surely not yueh?
his suk conditioning would drive him mad first.

## how could i miss him?
the man with thufir is esmar tuek, smuggler, highly successful.

## water customs here are so fascinating...... don't you think, your highness?
when i arrived, my bathing towels were hurried away almost before i was dry.

## you mean they are cannibals?
i said they drink blood, not necessarily the blood of their own kind.

## isn't that so, dr. kynes?
not the blood, sir.

## beloved?
you young pup.

## is it atreides custom to abandon an honored guest...... without even the courtesy of a lame excuse?
forgive me, your highness.

## you were expecting someone more delicate, perhaps?
refined was the word i had in mind, actually.

## are you gonna dance with me or just stand there looking confused?
i didn't want to come here, you know.

## have you been hurt?
be still, captain.

## you see?
perhaps we should be the adults here.

## duncan?
forgive the abrupt arrival, milord.

## duncan?
paul.

## who?
traitor.

## who?
god forgive me.

## why?
not in quarters, sir.

## where is she?
you promised we'd be reunited.

## so where is she?
your wife is free, my good doctor.

## my noble duke, are you enjoying the show?
i hope so.

## what?
paul.

## we couldn't have all that noble blood all over our hands, could we?
the emperor was quite insistent about that.

## did i say that?
how impolitic of me.

## you won't say anything will you, my dear man?
perhaps we should get on with it, then.

## the tooth.
get on with it?

## what did he say?
tooth.

## what did he say, piter?
the tooth.

## what are you doing?
we won't survive longer than a few hours in the open.

## one of ours?
we can't take the chance.

## what is this place?
a fremen sietch.

## how did you know where to find us?
dr. yueh sent a courier.

## you're the one, aren't you?
the one who's never seen, the one who may not even exist at all.

## guiding them?
until mahdi comes.

## you're coming with us?
no.

## me?
i'm dr. kynes.

## i work for the emperor, you remember?
i'll just say i was your hostage.

## unless they want to die, they won't follow us in, will they?
i must not fear.

## opening nights?
i love opening nights.

## how are you?
good to see you.

## sir herbert, how are you?
this is my wife.

## one of mr barrie's finest?
oh, that genius scotsman has done it again.

## sorry?
good audience tonight.

## how much longer?
um, ten minutes, sir.

## how are you, john?
very well.

## how are you?
healthy and wealthy, i see.

## have you got the tickets?
they're in my pocket.

## have you seen him?
i'm not sure where he is, actually.

## are you right to find your seat?
oh, yes, yes.

## sir?
it's like a dentist's office out there.

## why?
i wouldn't say they hate it, sir.

## do you like it?
i've just been hired here, sir.

## yes or no?
i'm not bothered.

## crap, sir?
go on, say it.

## it's shite, isn't it?
go on.

## might i knock a tune, milord, for a moment?
i'm an old man...... and i've seen few of the sights.

## can you?
no, i can't.

## how are you?
arthur.

## was i?
we were beginning to wonder which is your hobby, writing or cricket.

## oh, yes, but we shouldn't interrupt them, should we?
i don't see why not.

## you remember mr and mrs snow, don't you?
mrs snow.

## was it?
well, thank you.

## how did you feel it went?
i think i can do better.

## yes, james?
i'm headed off for the park if you'd like to join me.

## you'll be working, won't you?
perhaps, yes.

## who do you belong to?
come on, boy.

## am i?
so sorry.

## well, if you're trapped in the dungeon, there isn't much to be done now, is there?
perhaps i could slide a key to you through the bars.

## is he bothering you, sir?
my brother can be an extremely irritating sort of person.

## what did you say your name was?
michael.

## what precisely is michael's crime?
he's my younger brother.

## do you mind us playing with your dog?
no.

## are my boys bothering you?
we're not bothering him, mum.

## jm barrie, the author?
a pleasure.

## are you a writer?
i am.

## what have you written, mr barrie?
well, currently, i make my living entertaining princes and their courts with my trained bear, porthos.

## what did you bring me over here for?
peter.

## peter, where are your manners?
with those eyes, my bonny lad, i'm afraid you'd never see it.

## peter, didn't you enjoy that?
i've seen better.

## what's her name?
sylvia.

## you know her?
i know who she is, of course.

## should we?
absolutely.

## what are you writing about?
oh.

## well, then how do you know?
i know.

## where's your mother today and the rest of the boys?
home.

## why didn't you tell me, charles?
you knew it wasn't any good.

## why didn't you tell me, james?
you knew it wasn't any good.

## hm?
i took an extended lease on the theater, keeping the actors on.

## won't you?
we'll see.

## you know what happened, james?
they changed it.

## they changed what?
the critics.

## what's it called?
bang, bang, bang!

## ooh, we are awful, aren't we?
i'm warning you.

## well, grief affects us all in different ways, doesn't it?
yes, it does.

## don't you all look lovely in your little suits?
and, mrs du maurier, what a shame it is that we've not met until this evening.

## where did you get your manners?
sorry, grandmother.

## what was it?
tsetse fly.

## but the fishing was good, wasn't it?
james.

## a grown man, for heaven's sake, playing all day long with children?
in any case, i hardly think they'll be the social contact we'd hoped for.

## i want to do it.
but what does that mean?

## that's good.
you coming, peter?

## now, would you like to give it a go?
yes, please.

## look, i think i feel a bit more breeze.
ready?

## are you ready, michael?
oh, just making notes.

## now, why do you ask that?
i don't know.

## why not give it a try?
i hope you haven't been talking about anything too serious with this one.

## can we have him for supper?
have him to stay for supper, michael.

## where have you been?
flying a kite, mother, and having a wonderful time.

## no?
well, apparently you forgot then.

## well, there's no food in the house, is there?
really.

## will we see you tomorrow?
no.

## are you sure?
it was a lovely meal.

## listen, what would you think of loaning ema out to the davies for the occasional evening?
they don't actually have a cook.

## i take it mrs davies enjoyed the meal that she had here?
i imagine she could use an extra hand now and again.

## and what about linen?
i wouldn't be surprised if some of hers was looking a bit shabby.

## yes, well, we dream on a budget here, don't we?
no, i mean, everyone thinks it's made of gold, but it's just an old hunk of wood.

## what's this?
all great writers begin with a good leather binding and a respectable title.

## what whale?
the one that's trapped in your imagination and desperate to get out.

## a play?
a play indeed, yes.

## where?
neverland.

## neverland?
one day i'll take you there.

## he's a fairy?
er, no.

## tinker bell is a woman?
she's not a woman.

## james, how does anyone stay young forever?
it doesn't work.

## he imagines life the way he wants it to be, and he believes in it long enough and hard enough that it all appears before him, see?
james, i'm your friend.

## you know what i think i'll do?
i think i'll imagine life the way i want it to be...

## long enough and hard enough?
yes, and then the money for the play will appear magically before me.

## how does the clock wind up inside the crocodile?
well done.

## spend a good deal of time with them, don't you?
every moment i can spare, in fact.

## what are they saying?
very well.

## how could anyone think something so evil?
they're children.

## then why is no one sitting with them?
once you get a bit of notoriety, james, people watch you and they will look for ways to drag you down.

## are you sure your wife doesn't object to us taking over your cottage for the summer, james?
she doesn't go there anymore.

## really?
it's such a relief to get away.

## you'll come and visit, i hope?
of course.

## can i drive, uncle jim?
er, no.

## are we there yet?
don't tear your clothes, please.

## would you like to see the rest of it?
off to the ship with you, then.

## well, maybe the crocodiles, eh?
no one's escaped, captain.

## not finished yet.
who amongst you is ready to tie your hopes and dreams to the sea?

## what did you say?
i said i'm ready, captain.

## what's your name, boy?
i'm curly, the oldest and wisest of the crew.

## and who be you, young squire?
my name be nibs the cut throat.

## and you, lad?
i'm peter.

## what about dastardly jim, eh?
no.

## what are you playing again?
the boy.

## what have you got...?
excuse me.

## mr barrie, sir?
there's been a mistake here, sir.

## i don't imagine i quite fit that part, eh?
you're not actually the nanny.

## what?
a newfoundland.

## actually, we don't have a tinker bell cast, do we?
he could play tinker bell.

## how were rehearsals?
fine.

## how was your journey?
it was quite long.

## can you come to the playhouse?
in a moment, michael.

## what surprise, darling?
it's a great surprise.

## oh, well, you didn't really tell us anything about it, did you?
yes i did.

## it's a play?
the lamentable tale of lady ursula.

## mother?
no, james.

## when would i have time for that?
besides, this family's had enough of hospitals.

## what did you and mother decide to tell us this time?
we hadn't decided anything.

## what's this?
peter.

## magic's gone out of it a bit now, hasn't it?
all because of a silly chest cold.

## well, you remember gilbert cannan, don't you?
good evening.

## not so late?
that will be fine.

## what would you like me to say?
and then, let's see.

## what comes next?
no later than you were out, james.

## oh, yes, i would have a great answer for that one, wouldn't i?
how dare you.

## perhaps we can talk in the morning, yes?
good night then.

## don't you agree this is a little bit tight?
no.

## baggy?
quite frumpy.

## plank of wood?
some wood there on the shoulders as well.

## may i take your hat?
that's enough, boys.

## boys, why don't you go and play in the garden?
go on.

## is he in trouble?
sh.

## why don't you join them, dear?
very well.

## would you close the door, please?
certainly.

## you're moving in?
i'm going where i'm most needed.

## don't you see what a visit to the summer cottage of a married man does for a widow's future prospects?
sylvia needs to find someone.

## what are you suggesting?
i'm suggesting that you protect what you have, mr barrie.

## still, you knew who i meant, didn't you?
that's some comfort, actually.

## what was i supposed to do, james?
you were always gone.

## to spend with your muse?
no, i'm tired of waiting, james.

## what?
first you get the pajamas, then you make the bed.

## with my paws?
you make the bed with your paws.

## because in fact, being a dog, you haven't any proper digits, have you?
well, i don't have any teeth, either.

## can we get him some teeth?
he can have mine.

## let's have a wee break, shall we?
right.

## you know how much money i put into this show that i haven't even found yet?
listen, listen.

## 25?
25 seats.

## are they paying for it?
they're filled.

## uncle jim?
hello, boys.

## could i speak to you for a moment, please?
certainly.

## who's paying for them?
throughout the theater.

## who's paying for these 25 seats?
they're filled up seats, charles.

## we don't need to use much pull at all, see?
as long as we've got the balance down.

## but you think it's serious?
it could be.

## she's run you off, hasn't she?
oh, she's absolutely tried with great effort.

## what's happened?
yeah, you can have a little go if you want.

## can i have a go?
in a minute.

## can i have a go?
jack.

## i'm so sorry.
what are you...?

## mr barrie?
mrs davies would like a word with you.

## encourage what?
oh, james, please.

## so you've already spoken to a doctor then?
that is not your concern.

## peter, could you help george to fold a pocket handkerchief, please?
they're in the linen cupboard.

## darling?
yes, mother.

## would you check your shirt tails in the intermission, please?
yes, mother.

## you're not planning on attending any after theater events, are you?
only for a short time if we do.

## would you see if george has the tickets, please?
i'll just check the dressing table.

## michael, where are your socks?
wait here, don't move.

## oh, take michael with you, would you?
she looks much worse than when we were at the cottage.

## those 25 seats, has anyone shown up?
no, sir.

## have there been many people asking for seats?
yes, sir.

## the 25 seats, are they filled?
it's taken care of.

## who did you invite?
because obviously whoever you invited decided not to come.

## charles?
hello, mr stanley.

## have you seen the davies family this evening?
no, sir.

## can i do anything, mother?
no, darling.

## what do you want?
take it out.

## what?
they're here.

## who's here?
do forgive them being a bit late short legs, long walk from the orphanage.

## who are you?
no one there.

## how is she?
she's resting.

## may i see her?
no, mr barrie.

## yes, darling?
james.

## see?
this needs mending.

## boys, would you give me a moment with your mother, please?
thank you.

## we've pretended for some time now that you're a part of this family, haven't we?
you've come to mean so much to us all that now it doesn't matter if it's true.

## how do you do it?
you just think lovely, wonderful thoughts and they lift you up in the air.

## couldn't you do it very slowly once?
yes, i've got it now, wendy.

## are you sure there's nothing else i can do for you?
no.

## perhaps some time soon though?
most definitely.

## d'you mean we shall both be drowned?
look how the water is rising.

## why shouldn't it carry you?
both of us.

## and you a lady?
never.

## quite the scandal, so i'm told.
ready, wendy?

## how are you?
i'm all right.

## how are you?
i'm sorry.

## where's mr snow this evening?
oh.

## how are you doing?
i'm doing well enough now, thank you.

## i suppose it's all the work of the ticking crocodile, isn't it?
time is chasing after all of us.

## isn't that right?
that's right, mrs snow.

## was that mr barrie?
that was mr barrie.

## it's about our summer together, isn't it?
it is.

## did you like it?
it's magical.

## you're peter pan?
why, you must be quite the little adventurer.

## and there's been no improvement since my last visit?
no.

## has james been by at all today, mother?
dr brighton.

## may i have a word?
excuse me a moment.

## you haven't been keeping him from me, have you?
as a matter of fact, i actually hoped he might come.

## what is it?
it's a secret.

## mother, could you come downstairs for a moment?
oh, she can't come downstairs.

## what are you thinking of, george?
actually, i think a trip downstairs might do her good, ma'am.

## what have you been up to?
just wait and see.

## you know fairies, peter?
yes.

## isn't there?
oh, no.

## wendy and the boys captured by the pirates?
i'll rescue her.

## who could have poisoned it?
why, tink.

## and you drank it to save my life?
tink.

## are you dying?
her light is growing faint.

## do you believe in fairies?
say quick that you believe.

## george, would you take the boys back to the house?
i'll be with you in a moment.

## meaning what?
sylvia has requested a co guardianship for the boys in her will.

## and what do you have to say about that?
i shall respect my daughter's wishes.

## do you think i could abandon those boys?
sit down, peter.

## but why did she have to die?
i don't know, boy.

## how?
by believing, peter.

## opening nights?
i love opening nights.

## how are you?
good to see you.

## sir herbert, how are you?
this is my wife.

## one of mr barrie's finest?
oh, that genius scotsman has done it again.

## sorry?
good audience tonight.

## how much longer?
um, ten minutes, sir.

## how are you, john?
very well.

## how are you?
healthy and wealthy, i see.

## have you got the tickets?
they're in my pocket.

## have you seen him?
i'm not sure where he is, actually.

## are you right to find your seat?
oh, yes, yes.

## sir?
it's like a dentist's office out there.

## why?
i wouldn't say they hate it, sir.

## do you like it?
i've just been hired here, sir.

## yes or no?
i'm not bothered.

## crap, sir?
go on, say it.

## it's shite, isn't it?
go on.

## might i knock a tune, milord, for a moment?
i'm an old man..... and i've seen few of the sights.

## can you?
no, i can't.

## how are you?
arthur.

## was i?
we were beginning to wonder which is your hobby, writing or cricket.

## oh yes, but we shouldn't interrupt them, should we?
i don't see why not.

## you remember mr and mrs snow, don't you?
mrs snow.

## was it?
well, thank you.

## how did you feel it went?
i think i can do better.

## yes, james?
i'm headed off for the park if you'd like to join me.

## you'll be working, won't you?
perhaps, yes.

## who do you belong to?
come on, boy.

## am i?
so sorry.

## well, if you're trapped in the dungeon, there isn't much to be done now, is there?
perhaps i could slide a key to you through the bars.

## is he bothering you, sir?
my brother can be an extremely irritating sort of person.

## what did you say your name was?
michael.

## what precisely is michael's crime?
he's my younger brother.

## do you mind us playing with your dog?
no.

## are my boys bothering you?
we're not bothering him, mum.

## jm barrie, the author?
a pleasure.

## are you a writer?
i am.

## what have you written, mr barrie?
well, currently, i make my living entertaining princes and their courts with my trained bear, porthos.

## what did you bring me over here for?
peter.

## peter, where are your manners?
with those eyes, my bonny lad, i'm afraid you'd never see it.

## peter, didn't you enjoy that?
i've seen better.

## what's her name?
sylvia.

## you know her?
i know who she is, of course.

## should we?
absolutely.

## what are you writing about?
oh.

## well, then how do you know?
i know.

## where's your mother today and the rest of the boys?
home.

## why didn't you tell me, charles?
you knew it wasn't any good.

## james?
you knew it wasn't any good.

## hm?
i took an extended lease on the theater, keeping the actors on.

## won't you?
we'll see.

## you know what happened, james?
they changed it.

## they changed what?
the critics.

## what's it called?
bang, bang, bang!

## ooh, we are awful, aren't we?
i'm warning you.

## well, grief affects us all in different ways, doesn't it?
yes, it does.

## don't you all look lovely in your little suits?
and, mrs du maurier, what a shame it is that we've not met until this evening.

## where did you get your manners?
sorry, grandmother.

## what was it?
tsetse fly.

## but the fishing was good, wasn't it?
james.

## a grown man, for heaven's sake, playing all day long with children?
in any case, i hardly think they'll be the social contact we'd hoped for.

## i want to do it.
but what does that mean?

## that's good.
you coming, peter?

## now, would you like to give it a go?
yes, please.

## look, i think i feel a bit more breeze.
ready?

## are you ready, michael?
oh, just making notes.

## now, why do you ask that?
i don't know.

## why not give it a try?
i hope you haven't been talking about anything too serious with this one.

## can we have him for supper?
have him to stay for supper, michael.

## where have you been?
flying a kite, mother, and having a wonderful time.

## no?
well, apparently you forgot then.

## well, there's no food in the house, is there?
really.

## will we see you tomorrow?
no.

## are you sure?
it was a lovely meal.

## listen, what would you think of loaning emma out to the davies for the occasional evening?
they don't actually have a cook.

## i take it mrs davies enjoyed the meal that she had here?
i imagine she could use an extra hand now and again.

## and what about linen?
i wouldn't be surprised if some of hers was looking a bit shabby.

## yes, well, we dream on a budget here, don't we?
no, i mean, everyone thinks it's made of gold, but it's just an old hunk of wood.

## what's this?
all great writers begin with a good leather binding and a respectable title.

## what whale?
the one that's trapped in your imagination and desperate to get out.

## a play?
a play indeed, yes.

## where?
neverland.

## neverland?
one day i'll take you there.

## he's a fairy?
er, no.

## tinker bell is a woman?
she's not a woman.

## james, how does anyone stay young forever?
it doesn't work.

## he imagines life the way he wants it to be, and he believes in it long enough and hard enough that it all appears before him, see?
james, i'm your friend.

## you know what i think i'll do?
i think i'll imagine life the way i want it to be...

## long enough and hard enough?
yes, and then the money for the play will appear magically before me.

## how does the clock wind up inside the crocodile?
well done.

## spend a good deal of time with them, don't you?
every moment i can spare, in fact.

## what are they saying?
very well.

## how could anyone think something so evil?
they're children.

## then why is no one sitting with them?
once you get a bit of notoriety, james, people watch you and they will look for ways to drag you down.

## are you sure your wife doesn't object to us taking over your cottage for the summer, james?
she doesn't go there anymore.

## really?
it's such a relief to get away.

## you'll come and visit, i hope?
of course.

## can i drive, uncle jim?
er, no.

## are we there yet?
don't tear your clothes, please.

## would you like to see the rest of it?
off to the ship with you, then.

## well, maybe the crocodiles, eh?
no one's escaped, captain.

## not finished yet.
who amongst you is ready to tie your hopes and dreams to the sea?

## what did you say?
i said i'm ready, captain.

## what's your name, boy?
i'm curly, the oldest and wisest of the crew.

## and who be you, young squire?
my name be nibs the cut throat.

## and you, lad?
i'm peter.

## what about dastardly jim, eh?
no.

## what are you playing again?
the boy.

## what have you got...?
excuse me.

## mr barrie, sir?
there's been a mistake here, sir.

## i don't imagine i quite fit that part, eh?
you're not actually the nanny.

## what?
a newfound land.

## actually, we don't have a tinker bell cast, do we?
he could play tinker bell.

## how were rehearsals?
fine.

## how was your journey?
it was quite long.

## can you come to the playhouse?
in a moment, michael.

## what surprise, darling?
it's a great surprise.

## oh, well, you didn't really tell us anything about it, did you?
yes i did.

## it's a play?
the lamentable tale of lady ursula.

## mother?
no, james.

## when would i have time for that?
besides, this family's had enough of hospitals.

## what did you and mother decide to tell us this time?
we hadn't decided anything.

## what's this?
peter.

## magic's gone out of it a bit now, hasn't it?
all because of a silly chest cold.

## well, you remember gilbert cannan, don't you?
good evening.

## not so late?
that will be fine.

## what would you like me to say?
and then, let's see.

## what comes next?
no later than you were out, james.

## oh, yes, i would have a great answer for that one, wouldn't i?
how dare you.

## perhaps we can talk in the morning, yes?
good night then.

## don't you agree this is a little bit tight?
no.

## baggy?
quite frumpy.

## plank of wood?
some wood there on the shoulders as well.

## may i take your hat?
that's enough, boys.

## boys, why don't you go and play in the garden?
go on.

## is he in trouble?
sh.

## why don't you join them, dear?
very well.

## would you close the door, please?
certainly.

## you're moving in?
i'm going where i'm most needed.

## don't you see what a visit to the summer cottage of a married man does for a widow's future prospects?
sylvia needs to find someone.

## what are you suggesting?
i'm suggesting that you protect what you have, mr barrie.

## still, you knew who i meant, didn't you?
that's some comfort, actually.

## what was i supposed to do, james?
you were always gone.

## to spend with your muse?
no, i'm tired of waiting, james.

## what?
first you get the pajamas, then you make the bed.

## with my paws?
you make the bed with your paws.

## because in fact, being a dog, you haven't any proper digits, have you?
well, i don't have any teeth, either.

## can we get him some teeth?
he can have mine.

## let's have a wee break, shall we?
right.

## you know how much money i put into this show that i haven't even found yet?
listen, listen.

## 25?
25 seats.

## are they paying for it?
they're filled.

## uncle jim?
hello, boys.

## could i speak to you for a moment, please?
certainly.

## who's paying for them?
throughout the theater.

## who's paying for these 25 seats?
they're filled up seats, charles.

## we don't need to use much pull at all, see?
as long as we've got the balance down.

## but you think it's serious?
it could be.

## she's run you off, hasn't she?
oh, she's absolutely tried with great effort.

## what's happened?
yeah, you can have a little go if you want.

## can i have a go?
in a minute.

## can i have a go?
jack.

## i'm so sorry.
what are you...?

## mr barrie?
mrs davies would like a word with you.

## encourage what?
oh, james, please.

## so you've already spoken to a doctor then?
that is not your concern.

## peter, could you help george to fold a pocket handkerchief, please?
they're in the linen cupboard.

## darling?
yes, mother.

## would you check your shirt tails in the intermission, please?
yes, mother.

## you're not planning on attending any after theater events, are you?
only for a short time if we do.

## would you see if george has the tickets, please?
i'll just check the dressing table.

## michael, where are your socks?
wait here, don't move.

## oh, take michael with you, would you?
she looks much worse than when we were at the cottage.

## those 25 seats, has anyone shown up?
no, sir.

## have there been many people asking for seats?
yes, sir.

## the 25 seats, are they filled?
it's taken care of.

## who did you invite?
because obviously whoever you invited decided not to come.

## charles?
hello, mr stanley.

## have you seen the davies family this evening?
no, sir.

## can i do anything, mother?
no, darling.

## what do you want?
take it out.

## what?
they're here.

## who's here?
do forgive them being a bit late short legs, long walk from the orphanage.

## who are you?
no one there.

## how is she?
she's resting.

## may i see her?
no, mr barrie.

## yes, darling?
james.

## see?
this needs mending.

## boys, would you give me a moment with your mother, please?
thank you.

## we've pretended for some time now that you're a part of this family, haven't we?
you've come to mean so much to us all that now it doesn't matter if it's true.

## how do you do it?
you just think lovely, wonderful thoughts and they lift you up in the air.

## couldn't you do it very slowly once?
yes, i've got it now, wendy.

## are you sure there's nothing else i can do for you?
no.

## perhaps some time soon though?
most definitely.

## d'you mean we shall both be drowned?
look how the water is rising.

## why shouldn't it carry you?
both of us.

## and you a lady?
never.

## quite the scandal, so i'm told.
ready, wendy?

## how are you?
i'm all right.

## how are you?
i'm sorry.

## where's mr snow this evening?
oh.

## how are you doing?
i'm doing well enough now, thank you.

## i suppose it's all the work of the ticking crocodile, isn't it?
time is chasing after all of us.

## isn't that right?

## would you like to touch it?
uh, i wouldn't.

## what?
honey, you promised you wouldn't take the boob out in front of company.

## why don't we go show them the lagoon?
the lagoon.

## roz, why don't you take them outside?
show them around.

## it's going good so far, right?
dad, you gotta take down that weird shrine thing.

## what's wrong with showing it?
it's ridiculous.

## since when do you care about most people?
i don't, but jack is really into winning and competition and sports.

## oh, for pity's sake.
you're avoiding confusion by strapping a boob on a man?

## isn't that nice, jack?
that is nice.

## i thought you had a sister?
nope.

## i went overboard?
a little bit.

## are you sure?
after all this buildup, the kids are finally getting married.

## little jack, were you about to speak?
nope, just a little flatulence.

## what were you saying, honey?
nothing, dear.

## guys, where are you going?
we're checking out jack's macho wacho trailer.

## can i talk to you for a sec?

## i mean, what if it was jinxy who got flushed into a toilet?
mr. jinx has had extensive aquatic training.

## so, what do you wanna do?

## what?
then we'll tell your dad you got pregnant on the honeymoon.

## it's perfect, right?
yeah.

## did you do that yourself?
oh, sure.

## high powered?
i wouldn't exactly call...

## why did you kick me?
truth is, jack, when gay was born, i stopped practicing and became a stay at home dad.

## so roz was the primary breadwinner and you didn't have a job?
dad.

## is that isabel?
oh, yeah.

## you know, she has her own catering business now, isn't that great?
and... and i asked her to come and help bernie in the kitchen this weekend.

## really?
i didn't have any monster crush.

## then i didn't catch you doing baziga to her passport photo when you were, what, 13?
honey, stop.

## nice to meet you, too.
where is he?

## not yet married, and already a little one?
and he is a handsome little focker.

## hey, do you guys want some more, uh, wine?
mas vino por la mama, si.

## she's very pretty, this one, huh?
yeah, she's, uh, she's really great.

## can you believe it's been 15 years?
so many wonderful memories from those days.

## so, you never told your fiancee about us, huh?
um, no, i don't think i did.

## you s slept with isabel?
we were relieved.

## what's the problem?
it was, what, 15 years ago.

## really?
that sounds like fun.

## you know what?
i suggest that we get back to talking about the wedding.

## mom, didn't you just take little jack back to the room?
i'm monitoring him from a high powered multidirectional microphone planted in his crib.

## whatever happened to a little thing called privacy?
bernie, surveillance technology has helped protect a lot of the freedoms that we as americans take advantage of today.

## the clla?
the central lack of intelligence agency.

## you're what?
the ferber method.

## look at his darling little teeth, isn't that sweet?
uh oh, somebody looks very grumpy there.

## the mohel?
no.

## let's not talk about the tiny turtle, okay?
let's...

## what's a semicirc?
i can't wait to hear this.

## what?
don't tell me you kept his umbilical cord.

## all right, you know what?
that's it.

## anyone in the mood for chinese?
you told me your first time was with the danish transfer student in high school.

## can we just let it go, please?
we both got enough stuff to deal with this weekend.

## how do you mean?
i know that you are studying my family like the frozen caveman.

## so, i just, i don't want you to be worried, okay?
i mean, they're a little quirky, but they they're well intentioned and... and i think they're just nervous and...

## who's bern?
i'm chad, the bellhop.

## can't you be sam the carpet cleaning man?
it's illogical.

## why would a carpet cleaner have whipped cream?
well, improvise, honey.

## do you mind if i put some foam down on your rug?
i don't mind at all.

## how long... how long have you worked in this hotel?
it's time to put some snow on your mountains.

## come on, man, you know what that cowboy hat on the door means.
gay, you see the cowboy hat on the door?

## what?
we're just being ourselves.

## i mean, why you're so afraid of this jack?
you've been kissing his ass ever since you got here.

## so you don't want us to be ourselves?
mom...

## just don't therapize the byrneses this weekend at all, okay?
all i'm saying is, a few minutes of concentrated work with him and dina, she could get him to blow like krakatoa.

## right, okay, yeah, you know what?
one day, just give me one day, okay, without any complications.

## can we do that?
all right.

## hon, put the hat back on the door, okay?
no mom.

## sleep okay?
i slept all right, thank you.

## bernard, do you mind if i have some privacy?
almost done.

## what's in it?
well, a lot of the taste comes from this old skillet.

## hey, guys, can i have everybody's attention, please?
gay, be back in a second.

## this june?
yeah.

## yeah, now, it's up to 50 fockers.

## was he impressed?
no, dad, he wasn't.

## what are you really asking me to do, gaylord?
i'm not asking anything of you, dad.

## just... just go down there and apologize to him, okay?
he thinks it was a cheap shot.

## what?
come on, honey, i knew it the minute i saw her.

## you didn't tell dad, did you?
no, not yet.

## why not?
because he can't keep a secret.

## are you kidding?
uh, no, it just sort of happened.

## how?
it just happened.

## no?
i got a guy who can fix your rv.

## why would someone call you barry poppins?
they wouldn't.

## is that clear?
mmm hmm.

## shall we get a move on, pal o mino?
i'm ready.

## honey, are you all right?
you look a little flushed.

## what's really going on with that man?
he seems very uptight.

## being a florist is stressful?
there's more to it than people think.

## if you don't mind me asking, how is your sex life?
i can't tell you that.

## what's the big deal?
i'm a professional.

## how?
well, it all starts with a little bit of, uh, how shall i say, intimate contact.

## but you have to promise that you don't tell grandpa jack anything, okay?
all right.

## i know we aren't supposed to watch tv but we won't tell grandpa jack, will we?
oh, look, look, it's elmo.

## you don't like fishes?
no.

## mmm?
oh, look, look, it's a... it's a... an abacus.

## how's it going with the little one?
horribly.

## you want me to give him a drink?
i'm talking, less than a thimbleful.

## little jack?
no one i know.

## what the hell happened?
i said no monkey business.

## give me the bottle.
no monkey business?

## what's happened to little jack?
his hands are stuck to the bottle of rum.

## and why are you wearing antlers?
it's very complicated.

## little jack, honey, are you okay?
greg...

## how's the little guy doing?
everything is just as good as new.

## is he all right?
he's asleep.

## what kind of sick cocktail were you gonna make my grandson?
jack, the baby's teething.

## it was your idea?
yes.

## what is wrong with you people?
i used to rub bourbon on denny's gums.

## greg, you couldn't follow a simple set of instructions?
jack, he was screaming.

## okay?
he's learning to self soothe.

## what are you saying?
and i have news for you.

## we hug our son?
let's get down to it.

## the little jack in me?
jack, you have issues.

## were you ever breastfed?
mom, stop.

## everybody just stop, okay?
jack, i am not going to make any excuses.

## okay?
that's it.

## did he say what i am thinking?
i think he did.

## little jack, what did you just say?
asshole.

## his first word?
it just slipped out of my mouth.

## has greg ever mentioned the name jorge to you?
jor...

## no, why?
because i think your fiance may have a few skeletons in his closet that he is not telling you about.

## oh, really?
he does not.

## do you know that?
yes, i know that.

## how could i keep it a secret?
he's so excited about being a grandpa.

## why?
jack's really angry.

## how often do we get to be grandparents?
we're having a toast.

## why?
we are honest people.

## why?
be quiet.

## why should we diminish our joy just because they live in denial?
seriously.

## i promised pam, okay?
she thinks it'll break his heart if he finds out.

## what's the matter what happened?
i was, uh, coming to apologize and my back went into spasm.

## you must be in a lot of pain, huh?
i don't mind pain.

## what are you doing?

## you're in your trailer?

## now show me how you would like a romantic evening to go.
what?

## oh, jack, wine and candles?
gosh, it's not even our anniversary.

## jack?

## things involving the fruit of your loins?
no.

## what's in your hand?
nothing.

## what is it?
you got something in your hand.

## is that a needle?

## you don't like me?

## and guess what?

## hey, how did your dad react to the pregnancy news?
well, just as you'd expect.

## what's going on?
well, your father wants to leave, and bernie is staging a sit in.

## how could you not see it?
greg is completely unfit to handle a child.

## who knows what to believe with you?
you're dishonest about everything.

why don't you tell everybody what you did last night to greg at the party.

## what?
yeah, i found this in his pocket.

## you drugged my son?
now look what you did.

i was talking to judge goldfarb.

## what're you saying, jack?
i'm saying, if you had kept your mouth shut in the first place we wouldn't be in this mess.

## what'd you do, give the judge your fondue recipe?
at least i'm comfortable enough in my own skin to cook for my family.

## when is the last time you gave her anything in bed?
now you're out of line, focker.

## would you guys stop?
he insulted me.

## well, this isn't about you, all right?

oh, she wants you to honk the horn.

## what're you saying?
now, wait a minute.

## what does this mean?
okay, good.

## what did you do, focker?
that's because it's from debbie's left breast, greg.

## what are you doing there?
well, during the breastfeeding stage, greg, infants can get very confused and upset when they're separated from their mothers.

## would you like to touch it?
uh, i wouldn't.

## what?
honey, you promised you wouldn't take the boob out in front of company.

## greg?
yeah.

## so, i think that falls under my responsibilities, right?
uh, yeah, sure.

## how about a cappuccino?

## what the heck is that contraption?
i thought you guys were flying in tonight.

## is this not the most handsome young man you've ever seen in your life?
i used to call him a young jewish marlon brando.

## i conceived him with one testicle?
no, really.

## what're you so shy about?
come here.

## you work out with weights, right?
well, i do various calisthenics.

## oh, footie footie football?
i was just, uh, practicing my capoeira.

## what?
oh, capoeira.

## is there a baby on board?
that's a baby.

## who's this little guy?

## what are you talking about?
he's a baby.

## you're not eating.
i'm gonna tell mom we're here, okay?

## what's the matter?
no.

## mom, how do we explain all these people to the byrneses?

## gay, you went duck hunting with... with jack?
um, yeah.

## you shot a duck?
i shot at a duck and...

## you killed an innocent creature of the sky?
i don't...

## what's that?
it's you.

## isn't it nice to finally display your accomplishments, son?
this one looks impressive.

## you know what i mean, jack?
not really, bernard.

## what kind of work does your mother do with those patients?
those look like yoga mats.

## is there yoga involved?
good, roz.

## and who's this little hairball?
they brought their grandson baby jack along.

## bern, did you show them where they're sleeping?
right, right, right.

## in the trailer?
come on, jack.

## let it go?
fine.

## right?
come on.

## why don't we go show them the lagoon?
the lagoon.

## roz, why don't you take them outside?
show them around.

## it's going good so far, right?
dad, you gotta take down that weird shrine thing.

## what's wrong with showing it?
it's ridiculous.

## since when do you care about most people?
i don't, but jack is really into winning and competition and sports.

## oh, for pity's sake.
you're avoiding confusion by strapping a boob on a man?

## isn't that nice, jack?
that is nice.

## i thought you had a sister?
nope.

## i went overboard?
a little bit.

## are you sure?
after all this build up, the kids are finally getting married.

## little jack, were you about to speak?
nope, just a little flatulence.

## what were you saying, honey?
nothing, dear.

## guys, where are you going?
we're checking out jack's macho wacho trailer.

## can i talk to you for a sec?
yeah.

## they seem to be getting along really well, don't you think?
yeah, they do.

## what's going on?
i'm pregnant.

## you're pregnant?
no, no, no, no, no.

## okay?
we'll tell them all.

## oh, honey, he was trying to save his pet.
what about my toilet?

## i mean, what if it was jinxy who got flushed into a toilet?
mr. jinx has had extensive aquatic training.

## so, what do you wanna do?
i'm not sure.

## what?
then we'll tell your dad you got pregnant on the honeymoon.

## it's perfect, right?
yeah.

## did you do that yourself?
oh, sure.

## high powered?
i wouldn't exactly call...

## why did you kick me?
truth is, jack, when gay was born, i stopped practicing and became a stay at home dad.

## so roz was the primary breadwinner and you didn't have a job?
dad.

## is that isabel?
oh, yeah.

## you know, she has her own catering business now, isn't that great?
and... and i asked her to come and help bernie in the kitchen this weekend.

## really?
i didn't have any monster crush.

## then i didn't catch you doing baziga to her passport photo when you were, what, 13?
honey, stop.

## nice to meet you, too.
where is he?

## not yet married, and already a little one?
and he is a handsome little focker.

## see?
oh, no.

## and still you stayed to raise her child?
good for you.

## really?
oh, she's just being silly.

## hey, do you guys want some more, uh, wine?
mas vino por la mama, si.

## she's very pretty, this one, huh?
yeah, she's, uh, she's really great.

## can you believe it's been 15 years?
so many wonderful memories from those days.

## so, you never told your fiance about us, huh?
um, no, i don't think i did.

## you s slept with isabel?
we were relieved.

## what's the problem?
it was, what, 15 years ago.

## really?
that sounds like fun.

## you know what?
i suggest that we get back to talking about the wedding.

## mom, didn't you just take little jack back to the room?
i'm monitoring him from a high powered multidirectional microphone planted in his crib.

## whatever happened to a little thing called privacy?
bernie, surveillance technology has helped protect a lot of the freedoms that we as americans take advantage of today.

## the clla?
the central lack of intelligence agency.

## you're what?
the ferber method.

## look at his darling little teeth, isn't that sweet?
uh oh, somebody looks very grumpy there.

## the mohel?
no.

## let's not talk about the tiny turtle, okay?
let's...

## what's a semicirc?
i can't wait to hear this.

## what?
don't tell me you kept his umbilical cord.

## all right, you know what?
that's it.

## anyone in the mood for chinese?
you told me your first time was with the danish transfer student in high school.

## can we just let it go, please?
we both got enough stuff to deal with this weekend.

## how do you mean?
i know that you are studying my family like the frozen caveman.

## so, i just, i don't want you to be worried, okay?
i mean, they're a little quirky, but they they're well intentioned and... and i think they're just nervous and...

## who's bern?
i'm chad, the bellhop.

## can't you be sam the carpet cleaning man?
it's illogical.

## why would a carpet cleaner have whipped cream?
well, improvise, honey.

## do you mind if i put some foam down on your rug?
i don't mind at all.

## how long... how long have you worked in this hotel?
it's time to put some snow on your mountains.

## come on, man, you know what that cowboy hat on the door means.
gay, you see the cowboy hat on the door?

## what?
we're just being ourselves.

## i mean, why you're so afraid of this jack?
you've been kissing his ass ever since you got here.

## so you don't want us to be ourselves?
mom...

## just don't therapize the byrneses this weekend at all, okay?
all i'm saying is, a few minutes of concentrated work with him and dina, she could get him to blow like krakatoa.

## right, okay, yeah, you know what?
one day, just give me one day, okay, without any complications.

## can we do that?
all right.

## hon, put the hat back on the door, okay?
no mom.

## sleep okay?
i slept all right, thank you.

## bernard, do you mind if i have some privacy?
almost done.

## what's in it?
well, a lot of the taste comes from this old skillet.

## hey, guys, can i have everybody's attention, please?
gay, be back in a second.

## this june?
yeah.

## yeah, now, it's up to 50 fockers.
wait, what party?

## when were you going to tell us about this?
50 fockers.

footy ball?

## honey, you want me to keep you company?

i'll throw you the ball, you try to catch it, okay.

## you want me to catch?
yeah.

## ready?
yes.

## you remember that time in the park?
guys, come on, come on, cut it out.

## what?
oh, a spritzer.

## dad, you got to focus, all right?
he's beating you down the field every time.

## you want me to be macho wacho?
no.

## have i ever said the words macho wacho to you in my life?
i got it.

## what?
i won't disappoint you.

## you want to mix it up a little?
no, i don't.

## on four?
four.

## you think you can take me, flower man?
i'm fine, greg, thank you.

## know what i mean?
okay.

## was he impressed?
no, dad, he wasn't.

## what are you really asking me to do, gaylord?
i'm not asking anything of you, dad.

## just... just go down there and apologize to him, okay?
he thinks it was a cheap shot.

## what?
come on, honey, i knew it the minute i saw her.

## you didn't tell dad, did you?
no, not yet.

## why not?
because he can't keep a secret.

## are you kidding?
uh, no, it just sort of happened.

## how?
it just happened.

## no?
i got a guy who can fix your rv.

## why would someone call you barry poppins?
they wouldn't.

## is that clear?
mmm hmm.

## shall we get a move on, pal o mino?
i'm ready.

## honey, are you all right?
you look a little flushed.

## what's really going on with that man?
he seems very uptight.

## being a florist is stressful?
there's more to it than people think.

## if you don't mind me asking, how is your sex life?
i can't tell you that.

## what's the big deal?
i'm a professional.

## how?
well, it all starts with a little bit of, uh, how shall i say, intimate contact.

## but you have to promise that you don't tell grandpa jack anything, okay?
all right.

## i know we aren't supposed to watch tv but we won't tell grandpa jack, will we?
oh, look, look, it's elmo.

## you don't like fishes?
no.

## mmm?
oh, look, look, it's a... it's a... an abacus.

## abacuses aren't that much fun, are they?
i don't know why people think they're fun.

## hmm?
fun bolts.

## 15, huh?
genius.

## jorge, what did i tell you?
no more tinkering until you finish your science homework.

## i made chimichangas.

## why are you looking at me funny?
l...

## can you say tadpole?
mad bull.

## is your father the mechanic?
oh, i...

## never met your dad, huh?
oh, that's unfortunate.

## mind if i take a picture of you?
you know, just for fun.

## how's it going with the little one?
horribly.

## you want me to give him a drink?
i'm talking, less than a thimbleful.

## little jack?
no one i know.

## what the hell happened?
i said no monkey business.

## give me the bottle.
no monkey business?

## what's happened to little jack?
his hands are stuck to the bottle of rum.

## and why are you wearing antlers?
it's very complicated.

## little jack, honey, are you okay?
greg...

## how's the little guy doing?
everything is just as good as new.

## is he all right?
he's asleep.

## what kind of sick cocktail were you gonna make my grandson?
jack, the baby's teething.

## it was your idea?
yes.

## what is wrong with you people?
i used to rub bourbon on denny's gums.

## greg, you couldn't follow a simple set of instructions?
jack, he was screaming.

## okay?
he's learning to self soothe.

## what are you saying?
and i have news for you.

## we hug our son?
let's get down to it.

## the little jack in me?
jack, you have issues.

## were you ever breastfed?
mom, stop.

## everybody just stop, okay?
jack, i am not going to make any excuses.

## okay?
that's it.

## did he say what i am thinking?
i think he did.

## little jack, what did you just say?
asshole.

## his first word?
it just slipped out of my mouth.

## has greg ever mentioned the name jorge to you?
jor...

## no, why?
because i think your fiance may have a few skeletons in his closet that he is not telling you about.

## oh, really?
he does not.

## do you know that?
yes, i know that.

## how could i keep it a secret?
he's so excited about being a grandpa.

## why?
jack's really angry.

## how often do we get to be grandparents?
we're having a toast.

## why?
we are honest people.

## why?
be quiet.

## why should we diminish our joy just because they live in denial?
seriously.

## i promised pam, okay?
she thinks it'll break his heart if he finds out.

## what's the matter what happened?
i was, uh, coming to apologize and my back went into spasm.

## you must be in a lot of pain, huh?
i don't mind pain.

## what are you doing?
it's a technique i learned in hawaii.

## what're you doing?
we were so close.

## yello?
bernie, this is jack byrnes.

## hey, where are you calling from?
i'm in my rv.

## you're in your trailer?
thank you, goodbye.

## greg, wait, okay?
listen, no matter how hard he probes you, you have to promise me that you will not break because i'm not ready to tell him i'm pregnant.

## now show me how you would like a romantic evening to go.
what?

## oh, jack, wine and candles?
gosh, it's not even our anniversary.

## jack?
down here, under the bed.

## so this is like your, uh, mobile command center for all your spy activities?
mainly a secure space for me to spend some alone time and reflect on my thoughts.

## yeah?
you'll recall, we had a discussion earlier in the week regarding my feelings about family, legacies, children and so forth.

## things involving the fruit of your loins?
no.

well, during the breastfeeding stage, greg, infants can get very confused and upset when they're separated from their mothers.

## would you like to touch it?
uh, i wouldn't.

## what?
honey, you promised you wouldn't take the boob out in front of company.

those look like yoga mats.

## is there yoga involved?
good, roz.

they brought their grandson baby jack along.

## bern, did you show them where they're sleeping?
right, right, right.

## in the trailer?
come on, jack.

## let it go?
fine.

## right?
come on.

## why don't we go show them the lagoon?
the lagoon.

## roz, why don't you take them outside?
dad, you gotta take down that weird shrine thing.

## what's wrong with showing it?
it's ridiculous.

## since when do you care about most people?
i don't, but jack is really into winning and competition and sports.

## oh, for pity's sake.
you're avoiding confusion by strapping a boob on a man?

## isn't that nice, jack?
that is nice.

## i thought you had a sister?
nope.

## i went overboard?
a little bit.

## are you sure?
after all this build up, the kids are finally getting married.

## little jack, were you about to speak?
nope, just a little flatulence.

## what were you saying, honey?
nothing, dear.

## guys, where are you going?
we're checking out jack's macho wacho trailer.

## can i talk to you for a sec?
yeah.

## they seem to be getting along really well, don't you think?
yeah, they do.

## what's going on?
i'm pregnant.

## you're pregnant?
no, no, no, no, no.

## okay?
we'll tell them all.

## oh, honey, he was trying to save his pet.
what about my toilet?

## i mean, what if it was jinxy who got flushed into a toilet?
mr. jinx has had extensive aquatic training.

## so, what do you wanna do?
i'm not sure.

## what?
then we'll tell your dad you got pregnant on the honeymoon.

## it's perfect, right?
yeah.

## did you do that yourself?
oh, sure.

## you kicked me.
high powered?

## why did you kick me?
truth is, jack, when gay was born, i stopped practicing and became a stay at home dad.

## so roz was the primary breadwinner and you didn't have a job?
dad.

## is that isabel?
oh, yeah.

## you know, she has her own catering business now, isn't that great?
and and i asked her to come and help bernie in the kitchen this weekend.

## really?
i didn't have any monster crush.

## then i didn't catch you doing baziga to her passport photo when you were, what, 13?
honey, stop.

## nice to meet you, too.
where is he?

## not yet married, and already a little one?
and he is a handsome little focker.

## see?
oh, no.

## and still you stayed to raise her child?
good for you.

## really?
oh, she's just being silly.

## hey, do you guys want some more, uh, wine?
mas vino por la mama, si.

## she's very pretty, this one, huh?
yeah, she's, uh, she's really great.

## can you believe it's been 15 years?
so many wonderful memories from those days.

## so, you never told your fiance about us, huh?
um, no, i don't think i did.

## you s slept with isabel?
we were relieved.

## what's the problem?
it was, what, 15 years ago.

## really?
that sounds like fun.

## you know what?
i suggest that we get back to talking about the wedding.

## mom, didn't you just take little jack back to the room?
i'm monitoring him from a high powered multidirectional microphone planted in his crib.

## whatever happened to a little thing called privacy?
bernie, surveillance technology has helped protect a lot of the freedoms that we as americans take advantage of today.

## the clla?
the central lack of intelligence agency.

## you're what?
the ferber method.

## look at his darling little teeth, isn't that sweet?
uh oh, somebody looks very grumpy there.

## the mohel?
no.

## let's not talk about the tiny turtle, okay?
let's...

## what's a semicirc?
i can't wait to hear this.

## you wanted to talk about the wedding, right?
don't tell me you kept his umbilical cord.

## all right, you know what?
that's it.

## anyone in the mood for chinese?
you told me your first time was with the danish transfer student in high school.

## can we just let it go, please?
we both got enough stuff to deal with this weekend.

## how do you mean?
i know that you are studying my family like the frozen caveman.

## so, i just, i don't want you to be worried, okay?
i mean, they're a little quirky, but they they're well intentioned and and i think they're just nervous and...

## who's bern?
i'm chad, the bellhop.

## can't you be sam the carpet cleaning man?
it's illogical.

## why would a carpet cleaner have whipped cream?
well, improvise, honey.

## do you mind if i put some foam down on your rug?
i don't mind at all.

## how long how long have you worked in this hotel?
it's time to put some snow on your mountains.

## come on, man, you know what that cowboy hat on the door means.
gay, you see the cowboy hat on the door?

## what?
we're just being ourselves.

## i mean, why you're so afraid of this jack?
you've been kissing his ass ever since you got here.

## so you don't want us to be ourselves?
mom...

## just don't therapize the byrneses this weekend at all, okay?
all i'm saying is, a few minutes of concentrated work with him and dina, she could get him to blow like krakatoa.

## right, okay, yeah, you know what?
one day, just give me one day, okay, without any complications.

## can we do that?
all right.

## hon, put the hat back on the door, okay?
no mom.

## sleep okay?
i slept all right, thank you.

## bernard, do you mind if i have some privacy?
almost done.

## what's in it?
well, a lot of the taste comes from this old skillet.

## hey, guys, can i have everybody's attention, please?
gay, be back in a second.

## this june?
yeah.

## yeah, now, it's up to 50 fockers.
wait, what party?

## you want me to catch?
yeah.

## ready?
yes.

## you remember that time in the park?
guys, come on, come on, cut it out.

## what?
oh, a spritzer.

## dad, you got to focus, all right?
he's beating you down the field every time.

## you want me to be macho wacho?
no.

## have i ever said the words macho wacho to you in my life?
i got it.

## what?
i won't disappoint you.

## you want to mix it up a little?

## was he impressed?
no, dad, he wasn't.

## what are you really asking me to do, gaylord?
i'm not asking anything of you, dad.

## just just go down there and apologize to him, okay?
he thinks it was a cheap shot.

## what?
come on, honey, i knew it the minute i saw her.

## you didn't tell dad, did you?
no, not yet.

## why not?
because he can't keep a secret.

## are you kidding?
uh, no, it just sort of happened.

## how?
it just happened.

## no?

## why would someone call you barry poppins?
they wouldn't.

## is that clear?
mmm hmm.

## shall we get a move on, pal o mino?
i'm ready.

## honey, are you all right?
you look a little flushed.

## what's really going on with that man?
he seems very uptight.

## being a florist is stressful?
there's more to it than people think.

## if you don't mind me asking, how is your sex life?
i can't tell you that.

## what's the big deal?
i'm a professional.

## how?
well, it all starts with a little bit of, uh, how shall i say, intimate contact.

## but you have to promise that you don't tell grandpa jack anything, okay?
all right.

## i know we aren't supposed to watch tv but we won't tell grandpa jack, will we?
oh, look, look, it's elmo.

## you don't like fishes?
no.

## mmm?

horribly.

## you want me to give him a drink?
i'm talking, less than a thimbleful.

## what's happened to little jack?
his hands are stuck to the bottle of rum.

everything is just as good as new.

## is he all right?
he's asleep.

## what kind of sick cocktail were you gonna make my grandson?
jack, the baby's teething.

## it was your idea?
yes.

## what is wrong with you people?
i used to rub bourbon on denny's gums.

## greg, you couldn't follow a simple set of instructions?
jack, he was screaming.

## okay?
he's learning to self soothe.

## what are you saying?
and i have news for you.

## we hug our son?
let's get down to it.

## the little jack in me?
jack, you have issues.

## were you ever breastfed?
mom, stop.

## everybody just stop, okay?
jack, i am not going to make any excuses.

## okay?
that's it.

## did he say what i am thinking?
i think he did.

## little jack, what did you just say?
asshole.

## his first word?
it just slipped out of my mouth.

## i don't know what you're talking about.
what?

## no, why?
because i think your fianc may have a few skeletons in his closet that he is not telling you about.

## oh, really?
he does not.

## do you know that?
yes, i know that.

## how could i keep it a secret?
he's so excited about being a grandpa.

## why?
jack's really angry.

## how often do we get to be grandparents?
we're having a toast.

## why?
we are honest people.

## why?
be quiet.

## why should we diminish our joy just because they live in denial?
seriously.

## i promised pam, okay?
she thinks it'll break his heart if he finds out.

## what's the matter what happened?
i was, uh, coming to apologize and my back went into spasm.

## you're in your trailer?

## greg, wait, okay?

## now show me how you would like a romantic evening to go.
what?

## oh, jack, wine and candles?
gosh, it's not even our anniversary.

## jack?
down here, under the bed.

## so this is like your, uh, mobile command centre for all your spy activities?
mainly a secure space for me to spend some alone time and reflect on my thoughts.

## yeah?
you'll recall, we had a discussion earlier in the week regarding my feelings about family, legacies, children and so forth.

why don't you tell everybody what you did last night to greg at the party.

## what?
yeah, i found this in his pocket.

## you drugged my son?

oh, i know the person who has the originals.

## she really can't shut her mouth, can she?
i'll tell you what, look.

## because it's important?
because it's a name.

## well, how long do you think we got?
i'm gonna give them a couple of hours at least.

## what do we do about her?
i've got some duct tape in the back.

## see?
she's curious.

## what in the world did this guy want to be when he grew up?
we keep our focus on gates.

## where's the party?
well...

## i look pregnant?
this better not be about that dumb treasure.

## and he dragged you two into this nonsense?
literally.

## him?
look, if you just give us the letters, we're gone.

## you mean she was a ship?
yeah, she was beautiful.

## and the treasure?
no, no.

## don't you get it, ben?
i finally figured it out.

## what am i doing?
do what you want, ben.

## how old is it?
at least 200 years.

## you sure?
pretty darn.

## now if this thing's in invisible ink, how do we look at it?
throw it in the oven.

## why don't you get some rest?
i'm fine.

## see?
we need more juice.

## is it?
more clues.

## are those latitudes and longitudes?
that's why we need the silence dogood letters.

## that's the key?
yeah.

## will somebody please explain to me what these magic numbers are?
it's an ottendorf cipher.

## what's an ottendorf cipher?
they're just codes.

## so, dad, where are the letters?
you know, it's just by sheer happenstance that his grandfather...

## dad, where are the letters?
i don't have them, son.

## what?
i don't have them.

## where are they?
i donated them to the franklin institute in philadelphia.

## oh, my god.
the back of what?

## what have you done?
this is... this is the...

## you stole it?
dad, i can explain, but i don't have time.

## would you?
he tied me to a chair.

## we look kind of conspicuous, don't you think?
i'd love to go shopping, too, but we have no money.

## when are we gonna get there?
i'm hungry.

## you're sure this is right?
ok.

## you know what?
here.

## ok?
one more dollar.

## what's up?
so you show up at your father's door and say you're in trouble and the first thing he assumes is i'm pregnant.

## is there a question in there?
i think there's an interesting story in there.

## more than one someone?
yes.

## so you get your sense of absolute certainty from him, do you?
well, i'm sure i don't know what you mean.

## riley?
oh, i got it.

## why do you have to do that?
well, john pass and john stow cast the bell.

## well, then, what does the rest of this mean?
well, i thought the cipher was the map.

## what time?
wait a minute, wait.

## excuse me, can i see one of those hundred dollar bills i paid you with?
no.

## what do you see?
2:22.

## what time is it now?
almost three.

## you don't know this?
i i know something about history that you don't know.

## is this how you feel all the time?
because, you know...

## do you actually know who the first person to suggest daylight savings was?
benjamin franklin.

## is this real?
just tell me what you told my friend.

## can you remember which ones you were gonna tell him next?
yeah, here.

## who?
me.

## what?
it's not here.

## what bell is this?
it's the centennial bell.

## ok?
all right.

## what'd you score?
i found this.

## so, what do we do with them?
we look through it.

## what?
it's just that the last time this was here it was being signed.

## is it a treasure map?
take a look.

## how'd they find us?
well, lan has nearly unlimited resources.

## so what do we do?
we separate the lock from the key.

## really?
i'll take this.

## like if we get caught and killed?
yeah.

## who, baldy?
yes.

## do you want something?
hiding.

## have you seen this guy?
no.

## what?
we lost it.

## what?
we lost the declaration.

## you both all right?
yeah, yeah, we're all right.

## excuse me?
that's some story.

## is there a door that doesn't lead to prison?
someone's got to go to prison, ben.

## so what are these for?
it's a way to read the map.

## so what'd it say?
nothing else.

## are we set?
checking source.

## how are you?
um, chained to a desk.

## you know where that is?
new york.

## can i get a status report?
crow's nest in position.

## are you with me?
well, i'm sure not against you, if that's what you're asking.

## sound familiar?
keep sightlines clear.

## what's the devil's going on?
there's a lot of commotion.

## gates?
air tour helicopter, you are in controlled airspace.

## who's got gates?
all agents, report in.

## did gates speak to anybody?
target is moving.

## anyone got a view of our friend lan howe?
lan howe is not at the stern, sir.

## then why is he heading there?
he's at the observation deck.

## he set us up.
what's he talking about?

## can you see gates in the water?
sir, it's the hudson.

## what'd you do with abigail and riley?
hope these fit.

## i said, what'd you do with abigail and riley?
he's the only one who could've told you that line about edison.

## did you bring the glasses?
i don't know.

## how's your day going?
uh, interesting, dear.

## so, what, you working with lan now?
it turns out helping someone escape from fbi custody is a criminal act.

## i mean you're safe?
yeah, we both are.

## and where is that?
right across the street from where we're hiding, at the intersection of wall street and broadway.

## no broken bones?
a jump like that could kill a man.

## that's it?
that's it.

## where's my treasure?
it's right here.

## is that all the map said?
every word.

## you know the key to running a convincing bluff?
every once in a while you've got to be holding all the cards.

## is there anything else you want to tell me?
trinity church.

## well, why don't you ask dr chase and riley to join us?
i'm sure they're around here somewhere.

## what do you think?
i'm a hostage.

## what's the purpose?
just another clue.

## a street inside the church?
not inside.

## how?
i'm still working on it.

## who wants to go down the creepy tunnel inside the tomb first?
right.

## you got a light?
careful.

## what's this?
it's a chandelier.

## how do a bunch of guys with hand tools build all this?
same way they built the pyramids and the great wall of china.

## what are we waiting for?
i'm not going out on that thing.

## what is that?
subway.

## do you trust me?
yes.

## really?
i would have dropped you both.

## do you imagine any one of your lives is more valuable to me than shaw's?
we go on.

## now what?
this is...

## we came all this way for a dead end?
yes.

## hm?
you know where it is.

## lan, why don't you come back down here and we can talk through this together?
don't speak again.

## ben?
the lantern.

## and what does it mean?
boston.

## so you can escape in boston?
besides, with you out of the picture there's less baggage to carry.

## what if there's another clue?
then i'll know right where to find you.

## ok, boys, what's going on?
the british came by sea.

## where?
through the treasure room.

## now, ben, where is this other way out?
well, that's it.

## could it really be that simple?
the secret lies with charlotte.

## could this be possible?
look.

## just like that?
just like that.

## you do know you just handed me your biggest bargaining chip?
the declaration of independence is not a bargaining chip.

## i take it you found the treasure?
it's about five stories beneath your shoes.

## and what about you?
i'd really love not to go to prison.

## what do you care?
you got the girl.

## what?
a map.

## where does it lead to?
sell your farm... come with me to the city.

## couldn't she get drowned?
... then overturn the boat... it will look like an accident.

## nice job.
wilt thou love her?

## timothy treadwell is crazy about grizzly bears.
i gotta think, he was over ten feet high, don't you?

## how crazy?
sometimes...

## and you want to go and put yourself in harm's way 24 hours a day?
i think they've been misunderstood.

## what do you think, olie?
i think if you were weak around him, you're going down his gullet, going down the pipe.

## how are you?
don't you do that.

## just as long as the donations keep coming, furthering the antihuman eco religion as a noble cause, who cares about reality?
another one.

## that's where you're sitting?
there.

## how are you?
you're such a good champion.

## why is that?
because i'm on my way to the gri zz ly ma z e where bears do not have human protection, but are under human threat.

## hey, who's stealing that hat?
let me see that hat.

## ghost, what are you doing with that hat?
that hat is so frigging valuable for this trip.

## ghost, where's that hat?
it's not okay for you to steal it.

## and how do you see timothy treadwell's story?
i see it as something that's both...

## but he tried to protect the bears, didn't he?
i think he did more damage to the bears than he did...

## can you speak about amie?
amie was brave and amie was strong.

## do i feel like his widow?
yeah, you know, in some ways i do.

## you also founded a foundation with him?
yeah.

## and who do i see when i sit down in the office, waiting like you're in the jail or you're in the principal's office?
i see timothy treadwell.

## does that feel good?
we patrol the gri zz ly sanctuary together.

## how did we meet?
over a decade ago.

## don't you think?
if they knew how beautiful he was, and how sweet he was, they would never hurt him.

## can i take it?
i'm trying.

## why not?
i mean it's not... it's not that i'm a total great guy.

## you know?
gay guys have no problem.

## but you know what?
alas, timothy treadwell is not gay.

## did you ever get the story?
i was troubled.

## did you know that?
you wouldn't even know what that is.

## oh, duhl right?
you get pretty lonely.

## and what happened to you?
jewel, you must never listen to this.

## okay?
okay.

## what drove timothy into the wild?
we visited his parents in florida.

## i'm sure he loved it to the end, you know?
it's just... his childhood toy.

## how close a second?
i don't know.

## how's the hair look?
at some point in timmy's life, he had a near fatal overdose.

## that he didn't tell you the truth about his accent or his origins?
he was troubled.

## how dangerous?
i mean...

## isn't this... so sad?
this is a bumblebee who expired as it was working at doing the pollen thing on this alaskan fireweed.

## was it sleeping?
the storm's gonna go on and on and on.

## through our research, we found that you can harvest about 6  of the population annually and still have a healthy group of bears.
that's a pretty good idea, huh?

## and poaching?
poaching is not as big a concern around here as it has been in russia, for instance, and some other locations.

## don't you?
yeah, i'm the big cra z y guy with the... or the skinny cra z y guy with the camouflage makeup on.

## and what else is in there?
there's a little bit of lupin, there's a little bit of iris.

## where did you get the bear fur?
we picked it up off the ground.

## where are we?
we are at a campsite where timothy last camped.

## am i a great person?
i don't know.

## could this one be bear 141?
what looks playful could be desperation.

## the best time i ever had with my father... was when he was having maybe the worst time of his life.
is amie trying to get out of the shot?

## go figure, right?
no.

## well, did you do your reading?
yeah.

## how much?
well...

## all right, when you say you can rowboat, like, how far could you rowboat?
grape.

## you know what?
oh, see, that just sounds crazy.

## huh?
ok, girls, come on, bed.

## really?
come on.

## you think it might be gone that fast?
jeez.

## hello?
oh, yeah, just to tell you, a mr. kleinman is on his way up.

## so, you came by yourself?
yeah.

## huh?
i think you did.

## so, you just came just like this?
yeah.

## huh?
yeah, sure.

## why?
well, no, i mean, because you usually don't...

## it's a problem for a person to come and say hello?
no, of course you can, but, i mean...

## dinner?
no, no.

## now, you're sure?
absolutely.

## what did mom say?
go, go, go, go.

## are you hungry?
no.

## are you sure everything is all right?
yeah, sure, fine.

## what?
there's a little something i want to show you.

## ok, show me what?

## you going to fall asleep fast?
yeah.

## what's the matter?
it's from your mom.

## what does that mean?
i'm leaving.

## did you guys have a fight or something?
no fight.

## really?
so, why...

## so, where... where is she going to go?

## well, how did she sound, then?
she sounded fine.

## what letter?
benny, she's got her own problems.

## what letter?

## what'd she say?
she says she can't believe it.

## hey, ready for this?

## what's she doing there?
she came by to borrow the land cruiser.

## who?
hillary.

## hillary?
hillary.

## what is she doing there?
she came over to borrow her car.

## she actually, like, took clothes in a suitcase and went somewhere?
apparently, yeah.

## what?
they're...

## did you speak to bonnie?
no, i haven't spoken to bonnie since july.

## ok, would you... would you give her a call?
it's her turn to call me.

## oh, would you stop?

## why did no one tell me?
you know how much i worry.

## hello?

## how are you?

yes, of course he's going to stay with us tonight.

## you hearing this?
ben has pajamas.

## well, how is he?
he must be so lost.

## is that what he thinks this is?
he doesn't get it.

## would you get her feet off of there, please?
jeez.

## ok, what is your tomorrow?
well, now i don't know.

## take him with me?
yeah, keep him moving, distracted.

## what?
no, she's saying...

## and you would really go live on a farm?
it's not a farm.

## you know?
it appeals to me.

## you'd have like, what, chickens?
no, no, no.

## in upstate new york?
yeah, you could...

## why not?
well, new jersey has the fantastic corn.

## all right, well, you know what?
the point isn't to grow corn...

## what are we doing?
we're going...

## we're driving to go look at it, right?
no, i know.

## so, what do you know?
i had a thought, but no one wanted to hear it.

## well, if she's that fed up with your father... wouldn't she maybe want to look up an old boyfriend or something?
no.

## i should just turn around and come home right now, shouldn't i?
no, no.

## how's he doing?

## all right?
my great grandmother's family... gave her this land on her eighteenth birthday.

## is that right?
huh.

## really?
right after the civil war.

## i mean, it doesn't drain right into the lake, does it?
because i see the other houses up on the hill there... and i got to figure, if all that's draining into your water... oh, boy.

## am i wrong?
no.

## we got the money into escrow, we run an inspection... what do we find?
rats.

## right?
so, what you're saying is, there really... there is no house... that anyone could buy anywhere, ever.

## right?
i mean, all over the world.

## try what?
i don't know what you're saying now.

## yeah, just wait till everybody's dead, right?
ok, that's why mom left.

## you want to know why?
because of this.

## you ok?
i'm fine.

## so, what were you gonna show me?
nothing.

## what's this?
it's for you.

## from you?
it's from mom.

## it was so much fun the first time?
she wrote this...

## so, how did you get it?
when i was fourteen, i was digging around in her nightstand drawer.

## so, you took this?
yeah.

## and you keep this in the car?
no.

## so what if i cancelled my plans to go see the world's fair in queens?
i was working in manhattan... and making $13 a week to boot.

## what?
bullshit.

## that is not the way it was.
what do you mean, bullshit?

## you think it was like that?
i don't know what it was like, but that's... that's what she wrote.

## your father is such a callous... uncaring son of a bitch... that he ruined the marriage... that he made your mother that miserable?
let me tell you something, sonny boy.

## you know what crown carpet was when we started?
you bet i did.

## a rotten father?
crown carpets fed you kids... sent you to the best schools, the best summer camps.

## who of your friends ever went away to such nice places, huh?
mexico, puerto rico that time...

## to see how they make chocolate?
i don't give a shit how they make it, but i went for you and for the family.

## who's stopping you?
that i had an affair.

## what kind of craziness is that?
she wishes you had, so then you would've known what... what it...

## bernie kaye... you remember bernie kaye, the sales rep?

i'm gonna call someone.

## and you know what?
i'm gonna pee right here.

## who's more polite than me?

## but you're... you're gonna fix this first, right?
my wife is making chicken paprikash, and that is one dish i do not want to miss.

## you know what?
if you can just get it so i can drive it out of here...

## what do you say?
come on.

## is that all i'm gone?
jeez, it feels like a year.

## you see his phone ringing off the hook?

## you hearing this?
ok, your sisters are like little detectives now.

## are you there?
i'm here.

## where has she always wanted to go?
my first thought was france... because, you know, dad never wanted to go there.

## the schechners?
oh, the schechners.

## well, it's possible, no?
yeah, but she's always talking about them.

## so... how's the motel?

## you want to check with your wife?
i don't have to check with my wife.

## so?
ok, buy the car.

## you smell that leather?
i do.

## am i such a terrible driver?
no, you're not.

## yeah?
he would pull up in this big shiny car, open her door... and out would come these legs.

## you know why?
you didn't have this car then.

## what are you going to do?
look at us.

## wherever we want, whenever we want, huh?
ha ha ha.

## my dad?

me... with you and the girls.

## what did we forget to do?

## right there?
yes.

## what do you mean, it's not the hole?
there's got to be a thing where you...

## where does the worm go?
there's no worms.

## they forgot the worms?

you almost never use worms.

## how about this here?
that's big.

## what if a little fish swallows it?
it could choke.

## see?
l...

## does a fish smell?
they don't smell it, they see it.

## how could they smell under the water?
i don't know.

## what?
here, hold this.

## why do you keep saying what i'm saying?
let me talk.

## and what?
she's a very sweet girl, your wife.

## what'd she just say to you?
she said you can be quite a pain in the ass... and i shouldn't take it personal.

## now, the point is, if a person is determined... to be unhappy and angry their whole life... then you know what?
that's their problem.

## so, if mom was unhappy, you didn't care?
i never said i didn't care.

## so i'm the schmuck?
no, but...

## she's unhappy because of me, right?
no, i didn't say that.

## remember her father?
no.

## huh?
but, listen.

## you're really not going to try one?

## you know what?
i think that's all mom wanted, too.

## you're a nice guy, you know that?
ah, that's the tequila talking.

## it could go anywhere, right?
you could've gone to some parents in china... or timbuktu, but you didn't.

## who the hell knows?
but it worked out good.

## benny?
well, if that's camping...

## what?
her doctors discovered it two weeks ago.

## i mean, how can that be?
she didn't tell anyone.

## so, when she wrote that note on the refrigerator... she made that all up?

## how could this be?
hello, my busy playboys.

## how are you?
better than you.

## what did the doctor say?
oh, the doctor.

## you think i tell you everything?

i don't want to talk about it.

## we need to live in the country?
yeah.

## don't you?
your mother wanted that.

## so... you don't want it?
sorry.

## so when... when we're looking every sunday... in the magazine section and you're pointing... and you're pointing it out, what is that?
well, it seemed so important to you.

## how come you never mentioned this before?
oh, i have.

## what letter?

## where did you get this?
benny.

## what did i do now?

## what do you think?
i feel shitty.

## what?
what are you do...

## what, you didn't mean what you wrote in the letter?
well...

## hmm?
maybe... then.

## how about all the years between then and now?
benny.

## what are you doing?
wait.

## have i felt disappointed?
yes.

## do i wish some things had gone better?

## why did you leave him?
truth.

## plus... you know why else?
i know that when i'm gone... heh... you're not gonna know what to do.

## this way, you could practice... see what it's like, you know?
heh.

## what are you trying to do, kill me?
so it took me fifty years to understand.

## so?

## shall we?
the problem is, it isn't actually reaching them.

## so we've been wondering, is that a standard cock up, dr. ngaba, or or were the pills converted into the limo that you arrived in?
i think that's probably enough.

## well, what would you like me to do, sandy?
well, she's embarrassing our guests.

## uhuru?

## shall we run away?
yeah, come on then.

## what did you give her?
it doesn't matter.

## what is it?
tessa.

## why?
be reasonable.

## yeah?
i think.

## look, you should be wearing gloves with that, you know?
and there's a mask if you want it.

## i said, what the fuck is that?
tessa, it's pesticide.

## would you just get that thing out of this house?
well, if you feel that strongly about it, yes, tessa anything.

## unless they swallow it?
no.

## does she blame me for losing the baby?
of course not.

## wow.
take care of yourself ; tessa ; okay?

## who have you been talking to?
no one.

## these are my concerns, all right?
i'm thinking of your health.

## what the hell are you talking about?
i hope you know me better than that.

## will you get me up for breakfast?
i've got to finish my report.

## oh, you're just very blas, aren't you?
you know, just through feel.

## what's changed?
hi.

## having trouble with threebees, sandy?
just kenny being kenny.

## nothing to do with my report then?
oh, he's just ranting.

## really?
yes.

## to pellegrin?
yes.

## and?
there was no official response.

## well, what was there then?
well, just a personal letter.

## saying?
it's private.

## what do you mean, it's private?
that's the most ridiculous thing i've ever heard.

## why?
it's serious.

## what?
report where you are, what you're doing.

## sandy?
oh, tessa.

## that is, you're still coming, right?
yes, of course.

## you're not too busy, no?
one sec.

## sandy, what do you think of me?
i think you're beautiful.

## do you?
yes.

## really?
yes.

## are you serious?
yeah.

## when?
um, when i get back from loki.

## promise?
promise.

## tessa?
yeah.

## turn it off, will you?
certainly.

## when?
this morning.

## see?
i told you.

## dypraxa?
huh.

## anything missing in the bedroom?
her laptop's gone and her disks and all her files.

## what's in that?
oh, uh, her will, amongst other things.

## could someone please explain what they're doing, please?
look, justin, it it's just concrete.

## it's kioko?
yes.

## you brought a card for tessa?
yes.

## did you walk?
thank you.

## you'll always protect me ; won't you?
yeah.

## justin?
hi.

## listen, you know you know that i'm here for you, don't you?
yes, i do.

## what do you think that arnold and tessa were doing at lake turkana?
oh, i see.

## who's this?
it's claude.

## are you sure that is the right name?
uh, yes, wanza kilulu, and, uh, there was a white doctor attending to her, and he was there when she died.

## if i have no patient's record, how can i have a postmortem record?
and we don't have european doctors working here.

## you want money?
fifty.

## you don't know him?
kioko kilulu.

## kioko kilulu?
yes, a name.

## who is it?
it's a family, from here.

## a girl?
he's a young boy ; about 12.

## kioko?
kioko, hello.

## do do you remember me?
i've been looking for you.

## next.
is this the clinic where wanza was treated?

## why why was that lady turned away?
she refuses treatment.

## isn't that all the more reason to inoculate her child?
this is diphtheria vaccine.

## what is your business here ; please?
my name is quayle.

## uh, excuse me one may i see your card, kioko?
i see.

## that's the family it's a family medical card, right?
yes.

## i suppose they're not even informed that they're testing a new drug?
i don't make the rules ; mr. quayle.

## will you please come with us?
kioko, there's your card.

## why is the child being questioned?
it's okay.

## why did you come to talk to this boy?
he attended my wife's funeral, so i came to thank him.

## where did you find them?
well, perhaps i asked a policeman.

## can you tell me what i'm doing here, please?
we've been asked to... keep you here.

## could you explain?
i have not acquired a taste for kenyan tea, i'm afraid.

## can i help you?
yes.

## you weren't mistreated?
no.

## and your name is?
he ran away.

## where's your car, justin?
it's near the market.

## is that the official thinking then that arnold killed tessa?
i'm afraid that's looking likely.

## do you think that he was her lover?
i'm afraid that's looking likely too.

## what were they doing up at lake turkana?
romantic setting.

## but why suspect bluhm then?
i mean, there may have been others other lovers.

## i wouldn't listen to rumor, unless you've evidence?
yes, evidence.

## something that we shouldn't be seen talking about?
dypraxa.

## what makes you think i know?
because they trusted you, and so do i.

## why him?
sandy was a compromise semiofficial.

## because?
because she wanted to do it your way, through channels.

## ghita, why didn't she want me involved?
to protect you.

## do you know if she showed the report to anyone else?
kenny curtiss.

## time of the month, kenny?
fuck off.

## what are you lot going to do about it?
we never promised to protect you commercially.

## you protect me?
that's fucking rich.

## is it?
never really sure what it is we do.

## call that one in, shall we?
mr. curtiss, i'm sorry to disturb your game.

## what?
the f. c. o. will issue you with a new one in a few days.

## what if i want to travel with it?
just two, three days at the most.

## are you saying that's a forgery?
it does happen ; sir ; even on diplomatics.

## could you just tuck it into your cubbyhole, please, jimmy?
thank you.

## plans?
well, holiday, visiting friends, the million things you've always wanted to do in the garden.

## cleared for what?
um, of what.

## what is it that i'm not to look into, bernard?
quayles have always made reliable foreign service men.

## more challenging than dealing with kenny curtiss?
he's a crude sort of chap, our kenny, but he flies the flag for us.

## about kenny?
no, about dypraxa.

## what letter is that, bernard?
ramblings of an aging fart.

## what's yours about?
undying love.

## what's yours?
they're not so good grilled.

## can i?
tess left you bloody well off.

## want to know what you're worth?
not particularly.

## when did she say that?
two weeks before she died.

## have you had lunch?
yes, i have.

## and what's the other third?
oh, manzini, unquestionably.

## what marriage?
kdh and threebees.

## that phrase about the marriage is that tess's phrase or yours?
oh, hers.

## well, how do you do that?
all you need is the password.

## what's hippo?
oh ; i know that one.

## can we open that?
sure.

## it's huge, isn't it?
kdh is developing a revolutionary treatment for t. b. sufferers.

## magnify it?
he can send it out for doughnuts.

## is it possible to zoom in on it?
yeah, sure.

## why is he there?
there's a personal file.

## do you mind if i open it?
no, sure.

## this is where you work from?
hi.

## she loved you rotten too, you know.
do you still represent that dodgy client in amsterdam?

## you think?
oh, yeah.

## no point asking if you've heard from him, i suppose?
no, no, tim, none at all.

## i mean, is the african market worth that much?
tessa, you have to understand the scale of this.

## is there some safe place we could talk?
nowhere.

## nowhere?
please.

## scam?
dypraxa.

## does it cure t. b?
yes, it cures.

## so why don't they work on that?
it's cheaper to fix the trials.

## who?
a white coat.

## murdered?
disappeared.

## where?
moving on.

## does that mean he won't be able to contribute to tombola?
hardly kenny's fault if someone put the word out on him.

## hunting me now, justin?
you're the one on the run.

## what do you want for that?
i want to know why pellegrin suppressed tessa's report.

## it was him, wasn't it?
don't try and play detective.

## what's the story on that axis of evil?
kdh is swiss canadian.

## so why are we involved?
pressure on kenny... to stop the tests, redesign the bloody drug.

## you loved her.
or?

## you did it by... growing flowers.
remember?

## how did you betray her, sandy?
they wanted to know what she was up to.

## who did you tell?
yeah.

## is that where i'm going?
not on my agenda.

## then why are you showing me this?
let's just say if i'm going to the wall, i want a trophy.

## that's what you lot do, isn't it?
that bible thumping bullshitter, he's doing his penance in the sudan.

## who did you think it was?
fuck you, donohue.

## ghita's car?
well, ghita's my only friend here, tim.

## let's be honest with each other, shall we?
that's a... a late career change for you, tim.

## sandy tell you?
he fingered tessa.

## what about bluhm?
let me tell you what you're facing.

## yes, sir?
thank you for agreeing to take me, mr...

## dr. brandt?
yeah, he's just here.

## dr. brandt?
i'll see you over by the tent.

## but i can tell you what's happening around here, yeah?
good.

## how are you?
hello.

## how are you?
i'm very well.

## pretty crude, isn't it?
well, i've seen hospitals little better.

## this is how the world fucks africa, mr. black.
so have i. gharan, what surprises have they got in store for us this month?

## blood on their hands?
it's how they expiate their guilt.

## is it?
god has your head.

## so which particular devil had yours?
oh, you don't want to know about that, robert.

## what's your paper really interested in?
in the big pharmaceutical companies.

## something's going on out there.
who are you?

## why did my wife come here?
she...

## and did you?
this could be a raid.

## did you testify on tape?
she was a very persuasive woman, your wife, mr. quayle.

## but you kept a copy of the report, yes?
yes, i did.

## are you crazy?
we've got to get out of here, man.

## look, you're a lunatic.
have you lost your senses?

## do you know what you're doing?
sorry about that, jonah.

## how much do you want for her?
look, there's $800.

## but how did they know where to find her?
he'll know.

## i have one more favor to ask you, i'm sorry.
do you think that it would be possible to land the plane here?

## do you think you could post that envelope for me?
it's quite urgent.

## so who has got away with murder?
not, of course, the british government.

## you don't like my smile?
i don't like what's behind it.

## what's this all about, mr...?

## what's gonna happen to her?
well, all they can do is hold her for a few days.

## you know what?
why don't you guys go ahead, and i'll catch up.

## how come you're the only one who can see me?
i've been asking myself that question for years.

## who are you?
i'm conor donovan.

## has she tried this before?
no.

## can i ask how.. how i left?
it was, um, a year ago.

## my father gave me that same bike when i was about his age, and i just wanted to talk to him all about it, you know?
i wanted to ride that bike again so bad, but then, just like that, no more conor donovan.

## why?
look at her.

## how can i leave?
she's got no family.

## what?
we have to move her now, ma'am.

## did you stop by the hospital?
on my way in.

## i mean, how could she even know you?
she was unconscious the entire time.

## when?
she had an out of body experience before jim brought her back.

## small business assessment?
this is like 3 times what i thought it was gonna be.

## how did you do that?
tell her i'm here now.

## you mean like ghosts?
i don't know if they actually told you, but you... you died, only for a few seconds while my husband was working on you.

## how?
it's a long story.

## is he here now?
yes, baby, i'm right here.

## where?
right next to you.

## can he hear us?
yeah.

## hey, we'll see you soon, ok?
get some rest.

## see what i mean?
she's the..

## you said there was one more thing you need to do before you could go. what is it?
it might sound kind of morbid.

## why?
i'v... i've... i've got to see what kind of person is..

## like waxing and cleaning it?
no.

## what if i am happy here?
this isn't the place for you anymore.

## if gwen gets better, if i feel she is taken care of... then you'll go?
yes.

## does he dim the lights sometimes, too?
they can also use their energy to affect electricity if they try really hard.

## it's time for him to go.
how do you know all this?

## did i tell you he used to read to me if i couldn't fall asleep?
there will never be anybody else like him, not for me.

## how come a ghost would know where his heart went?
probably because he went straight to gwen when he died.

## why not?
well, maybe a recipient doesn't want to know where his organ came from especially a heart.

## it's just, the information is for someone very... are you family?
well, in the family of man sense, i guess.

## can you at least give me cities and initials?
this isn't jeopardy!.

## can you help me?
donor's name... date of death... and the code r w h o d.

## can i do anything for you?
rain check.

## you can go now, if that's what you mean?
damn.

## why?
it sounded like the truth.

## studying what?
the impact on people with things like this.

## things like?
transplants.

## do you?
ask me if i feel guilty because some guy i didn't know is dead and i'm here, talking to you about it.

## well, what did you expect?
i expected somebody filled with joy about having a new lease on life.

## hey, how's gwen?
feeling better.

## let's not ever take that for granted, ok?
deal.

## i mean, wouldn't you want the same thing for me if something happened to you?
fine.

## out of the question.
sure i would, ok?

## how did i snag such a sensitive, modern man?
guess you can just call me lucky.

## i don't know.
who could have done this?

## i don't know anybody who has this kind of money and how would they know?
i'm gonna call the tax board and find out.

## right?
that's a great idea.

## no karaoke?
cross my heart.

## is that him?
hi.

## um... take my picture?
you don't meet the height requirement.

## listen, can i talk to you?
digital is electronic.

## did you take these?
sometimes i think they just wasted this on me.

## who?

## we will?
i'm starving.

## but what did you think of her?
i feel like... i know her.

## how weird is that?
i felt... ah, forget it.

## why?
look, you're all about avoiding.

## was it to avoid death, or was it to choose life?
i think you owe me an explanation.

## can't you see how much pain she's in?
we had a deal.

## everything all right?
yeah.

## don't they all?
ok.

## what?
tomorrow.

## how do you have this kind of money?
i have a little nest egg put away.

## and it's fine, ok?
so don't worry.

## look, just pay me back when you can afford it, ok?
or, better yet, um... what? you could accept the $15, 000 as a down payment.

## for what?
for... making me your partner.

## yes?
and after a while, i...

## can he be talking about gwen?
you never told me what you thought of cliff.

## is conor here?
you can speak freely.

## so safe?

## how did i get here?
my leg hurts.

## can she see it dripping down my forehead?
she look ed at my hairline.

## laroche is a fun character, isn't he?
absolutely.

## or changing the orchids into poppies...... and making it about drug running, you know?
definitely.

## okay.
why can't there be a movie...... simply about flowers?

## hey.
or growing, or coming to like each other...... or overcoming obstacles to succeed in the end, you know?

## may i ask you gentlemen what you have in those pillowcases?
yes, sir, you absolutely may.

## you're aware it's illegal to remove plants or animals from state owned land?
yeah, and don't forget...... these plants are all endangered, sir.

## so you know that even though seminole chief billie killed a florida panther...... one of what, 40 in the entire world?
forty.

yeah, he's right.

## did you eat lunch?
i had that shrimp cocktail in the fridge.

i hope not.

## what's with you?
my back.

## a job is a plan. ls your plan a job?
drum roll, please.

## what about flowers for algernon?
well, that's not about flowers.

## how?
okay, keep going.

## are you a former fulbright scholar?
say something.

## because we're hip, young trendsetters on the make, aren't we?
more like old losers sitting on the floor, maybe.

## what, what, what?
well, i'm glad you took the orchid script.

## how do you know she was pretty?
after eight months of knowing you, i think i get what makes you sweat.

## well, moving on, what next?
you need a new getup.

## how to start?
i'm hungry.

## mr. laroche?
yeah.

## you wanna put this in?
i don't care what goes on here.

## that for real would go in?
absolutely.

## what are you up to now, then?
i should probably get to bed.

## why didn't i go in?
i'm such a chick en.

## hey, what are you driving?
it's well, it's a rental.

## where do these people learn to drive, huh?
the world's insane.

## the thing you gotta know is...... my whole life is looking for a goddamn profitable plant, see?
and that's the ghost.

## why the ghost orchid?
well, the sucker's rare.

## you know?
and i'm the only one in the world who knows how to cultivate it.

## did you get that last part?
yeah, i sure did.

## did you put the moves on her or something?
i'm looking for john laroche.

## well, you were at the swamp with him, weren't you?
i saw you at the courthouse, that's how i know.

## you see that nectary all the way down there?
darwin hypothesized a moth...... with a nose 1 2 inches long to pollinate it.

## how could they know that because of their little dance, the world lives?
but it does.

## why doesn't he get them fixed?
it seems almost sociopathic to make everybody look at that.

## i don't know, you know?
he's....

## what's in it?
you did it in the van.

## so how many turtles did you end up collecting?
i lost interest right after that.

## look, i'll tell you a story, all right?
i once fell deeply, you know, profoundly in love with tropical fish.

## but why?
done with fish.

## if you'd really loved something, wouldn't a little bit of it linger?
evidently laroche's finishes were downright and absolute.

## so, what looks good today?
the key lime pie, please.

## you wanna hear my pitch?
go away, goddamn it.

## okay, there's this serial killer, right?
well, no, wait.

## and he's taunting the cop, right?
sending clues who his next victim is.

## it's a little obvious, don't you think?
okay, but here's the twist.

## right?
see, he's actually really the cop and the girl.

## lsn't that fucked up?
the only idea more overused than serial killers is multiple personality.

## i mean, how could you have somebody held prisoner in a basement...... and working in a police station at the same time?
trick photography.

## what exactly would...?
i agree with mom.

## some key lime pie for you today?
okay, yeah.

## still reading about orchids, i hope?
yes, i am.

## wow, that's a lot, huh?
yeah.

## and you know why i like plants?
because they're so mutable.

## what, the makeup girl?
she was hitting on me, bro.

## come on, man, please?
you're the genius.

## do you mind if i use it, though?
it's really good.

## why did you do that?
because i wanted there to be more tension.

## but are you changing...?
keeps more tension.

## you like it?
i really like it.

## don't you think she's hot, bro?
i'm heading home, donald.

## really?
come on.

## so how are you?
you know me, a mess.

## ls the work good?

## you wanna make it into a movie?
lnto a movie.

you're a genius.

## see her?
i fucked her up the ass.

## you have the crazy plant nut guy, right?
he's funny.

## right?
there's not nearly enough of him to fill a book.

## are they amazing?
i don't know.

## yeah?
hi.

## how's it going?
great.

## yeah?
and i was hoping maybe you'd....

## really?
thank you so much.

## just whittle it down, you know?
focus on one thing in the story.

## up early for a change?
i'm putting in a chase sequence.

## and they're still all one person, right?
well, that's the big payoff.

## susan orlean is here?
yeah, she's here in town for a reading or something.

## who am i kidding?
i've finished my script.

## so would you show it to your agent?
it's called the three.

## that's kind of weird, huh?
it's self indulgent.

## hey, am i in the script?
i'm going to new york.

## who's gonna play me?
well, i've gotta write the book first, john.

## can i ask you a personal question?
look, we're not lost.

## so, you collect anything?
not really, no.

## your own fucking interests?
fucking spoiled bitch.

## hello?
hey, it's marty.

## what's her name?
susan orlean.

## well, i mean, are you making headway?
valerie's breathing down my neck.

## so...... what is the substance of writing?
i have failed.

## and here i am because my jaunt into the abyss brought me nothing.
i what the fuck am i doing here?

## well, isn't that just the risk one tak es for attempting something new?
i should leave right now.

## you follow?
good.

## what if a writer is attempting to create a story where nothing much happens?
where people don't change, they don't have any epiphanies.

## the real world?
yes, sir.

## are you out of your fucking mind?
people are murdered every day.

## yes?
i'm the guy you yelled at this morning.

## then what happens?
well, that's the end of the book.

## the script kind of makes fun of me, huh?
i'm sorry.

## so, what would you do?
you and me are so different, charles.

## just for fun...... how would the great donald end this script?
shut up.

## like what?
look.

## what turned that paper ball into a flower?
it's not in the book, charles.

## do you keep in touch with laroche?
i felt i detected an attraction to him in the subtext.

## what?
nothing.

## lf you could have dinner with one historical personage, living or dead...... who would it be?
well, i would have to say...... einstein.

## what happened?
nothing.

## did you embarrass me?
people who answer questions too right are liars.

## what the hell do you need binoculars for?
let's go, let's go.

## what's she hiding from him?
maybe she's a lesbian and doesn't know how to tell him.

## have you checked out laroche's porn site?
no.

## you mean mom?
no, i don't mean mom.

## okay?
i think it might help you.

no, that's not it.

## what the fuck was that?
i don't know.

## alone.
you hear me, you ugly creature?

## you know who's coming?
i know.

## wasn't your vanity, your intellectual pride... that brought you into conflict with bernardo gui before?
do not dare fate twice, william.

## and now?
now that lsaw herin the midst ofherpovertyandsquatter...

## which one frightens you most?
they all do.

## but how to reach the library?
no one should be forbidden to consult these books.

## master?
and doubt, adso, is the enemy offaith.

## i'm down here.
master?

## well, adso, it'd appear we're in a labyrinth.
is that you up there?

## are you still there?
yes.

## how do we get out?
with some difficulty.

## master?
i see a lantern.

## what's he doing?
he's raising his lantern.

## how many times?
three times.

## you didn't think me so foolish as to surrender... the parchment to the abbot without making a copy, right?
with the hand above the idol...

## what idol?
that's what we're here to find out.

## the 1o. and the 7o. of four what?
if i knew the answer of everything i'd teach theology in paris.

## you hear that?
it's my teeth, master.

## what?
my teeth.

## oh, yes.
how many times have i seen these objects of devil worship?

## won't you tell me... as a friend?
there's not much to tell.

## what happened then?
the man was burnt at stake... and i'm still alive.

## then tell me... who, among your brethren, is the heretic responsible for these murders?
i don't know.

## did i lie awake that night, suffering for the girl... or formyself?
i did not know.

## did christ or did he not owe... the clothes that he wore?
beloved brethren of the franciscan order... our holly father, the pope, has authorized me... and these servants to speak on his behalf.

## can't you show a little pity?
no.

## my heart is full of sorrow... but i can't find no reason to contest... the just sentence of the holly lnquisition.
to remember that you once looted and burnt the property ofthe church?

## and you, william of baskerville?
yes, he is guilty.

## why?
i don't know why.

## because you were inspired by the devil?
yes... that's it.

## it's brother malachia, father.
who told you?

## malachia?
william of baskerville was right.

## remember the inscription ofthe mirror?
we had to press above the idol.

## so now, what's it that you want?
i want to see the book in greek you said was never written.

## why does this one fill you with such fear?
because it's by aristotle.

## do you, salvatore, renounce the devil and embrace jesus christ... as your lord and savior?
do you, remigio de veragine, renounce the devil...

## what for?
it's better die fast than to spend... the rest of life in prison.

## but what's so alarming about laughter?
laughter kills fear... and without fear there can't be faith.

## can we laugh at god?
the world would be back to chaos.

## should we tell him?
no.

## but... what if he learns it of his own account?
you're overestimating his talents.

## what's your opinion, venerable jorge?
dear brothers...

## adso?
yes, master.

## to command nature... one must learn to obey it, huh?
so, return to the court, turn the building on your left... enter the court on you right.

## the other delegates have arrived?
ubertino de casale has been here for some weeks... the others are due tomorrow.

## you're not in need of anything?
no, thank you.

## you knew him?
no, but i knew and admired his work.

## brother william... may i speak to you candidly?
you seem anxious to do so.

## somebody told you?
there was something feminine... something diabolical... about the young one who died.

## she's beautiful, isn't she?
when a female... by nature so perverted... becomes sublime by holiness... then she can be the noble vehicle of grace.

## really?
i find it thrillingly.

## what if it wasn't that tower he fell from... but somewhere over there and the body rolled all the way down here?
no devil needed anymore.

## are you paying attention?
yes, he jumped.

## why else would someone go up there in the middle of a rainstorm?
not to admire the landscape.

## and then towed all the way up there with the body?
much easier to get rid of it through that small door.

## have you ever known a place where god would've felt at home?
we praise our lord that the debate... we are so greatly honored to host... may now proceed without a shadow of fear.

## were you not always a monk?
even monks have past, adso.

## do you apply arsenic in many circumstances?
yes, indeed.

## and what if not in so small doses?
death.

## what was his function here?
he was our finest translator of greek.

## was he in friendly terms with the handsome adelmo?
yes.

## but in a brotherly way understand?
not like...

## contemplating my sanctuary?
there, we have the devil.

## master, what language was he speaking?
all languages and none.

## what does it mean?
that the hunchback, undoubtedly... was once a herectic.

## who were they?
those who believed in the poverty of christ.

## so, could he not have killed the translator?
no.

## what do you mean from these footprints here?
or because he was carrying another man.

## where did the erudite greek translator... meet the anonymous author of his death?
brother librarian... perhaps you'd permit us to examine the work of the two unfortunates... who were so distressingly gone to god.

## can you be so sure?
there's nothing in the scriptures to say that he did.

## have you read this work?
of course not.

## which was the greek translator's desk?
this one.

## what'd you deduce from that visit?
that we're not meant to laugh in there.

## but you noticed how few books there were on the escritoire's shelves?
all those scriveners, copyists, translators, researchers... thinkers...

## what do you mean?
with all due respect... it seems that whenever you ask me a question, you already have the answer.

## do you know where the books are?
no, but i've faith that that tower contains something other than air.

## just as i thought, it must be bolted from inside.
did you see the little door the librarian closed as we came in?

## how do we get in?
obviously, there must be another entrance.

## who's there?
my magnifying glasses...

## are you afraid of me?
i'll find you.

## who was this creature that rose like the dawn... bewitched as the moon, radiant as the sun.. terrible as an army poised for battle?
good evening, salvatore.

## do you like?
thank you, no.

## so adelmo gave the parchment to berengar?
no.

## i found another one.
what happened then?

## have you ever met anyone with a rib cage large enough to accommodate... a heart ofthose dimensions?
this is the heart of an ox.

## what?
the one i saw out of here.

## why ugly?
if he'd been young and beautiful, she'd have blessed him... with her carnal favors for nothing.

## what did you say?
nothing, master.

## master?
there's something i must tell you.

## then, you'll hear my confession?
i'd rather you told me first as a friend.

## in love?
many times.

## you were?
of course.

## am l?
you are in love.

## is that bad?
for a monk it presents certain problems.

## but doesn't st thomas aquinas praise love above all the virtues?
of woman, thomas aquinas knew very little.

## yes, but what do you think, master?
he's probably hiding somewhere... with the book and my magnifying glasses.

## i was looking for brother berengar.
brother berengar?

## is he here?
no.

## do you know where we might find him?
no.

## or is he perhaps upstairs, in the library?
no.

## may i do so?
no.

## why not?
it's strict order of the abbot.

## what?
the third trumpet... as ubertino said.

## is it a chicken for you?
it's more like a sparrow.

## what if ubertino's right and you're wrong?
this debate's crucial to us all. we suspect the pope wants to crash our order.

## did you find a book in greek?
i was right.

## he was left handed?
brother berengar was inverted in many ways.

## are there other left handed brothers at the abbey?
not that i know.

## you see how the calligraphy changes?
from this point on, he was dying.

## how do we know that?
because those notes overrun...

## what kind of secret knowledge would he not have privilege?
i feel you're about to tell me.

## how do you know?
there was a witness.

## alone.
master, who's bernardo gui?

## you know who's coming?
i know.

## wasn't your vanity, your intellectual pride... that brought you into conflict with bernardo gui before?
do not dare fate twice, william.

## and now?
now that lsaw herin the midst ofherpovertyandsquatter...

## which one frightens you most?
they all do.

## but how to reach the library?
it's cheap...

## know what he said?
it's a miracle...

## oh, it's a waste of time.
what do they want?

## i can't live without you.
why don't you clear off?

## what shall i do if you leave me?
i'm begging you not to leave me.

## have you seen other people on this island?
no, i am not.

## who is?
there is no commanding officer here.

## formally?
no.

## do you know him?
yes, he was our commanding officer.

## you know where he is?
when the bombing started, he fled to hillah.

## hillah, huh?
yes, that is right.

## why?
there.

## see?
go back.

## what?
go back, ana lucia, and don't tell anyone what you saw.

## what are you doing here, danielle?
looking for you.

## where are we going?
you said you were looking for me.

## what was your plan to hide in the woods, hoping i would pass you by?
i was going to wait until dark, then find you at your tent.

## why?
we need to keep moving.

## how much further?
not far.

## what's he saying?
he says he does not know.

## g uards?
lock him back up.

## what do you got there, rerun?
dharma initiative ranch dressing.

## come on, man, please?
son of a bitch.

## have you seen it?
yeah.

## danielle?
we're here.

## she's crazy.
what is that for, danielle?

## how long has he been up there?
since last night.

## and then what?
you talk to him, sayid.

## you had relatives in that village, didn't you, sayid?
so you know what sarin gas does.

## how do you think we knew you had relatives in that village?
we liberated your personnel file and tariq's.

## what?
come out here.

## who are you?
henry.

## how did you get to this island?
four months ago, we crashed, my wife and i.

## crashed in what?
a balloon.

## your wife where is she?
rousseau trapped him in the jungle.

## what, you were just gonna let him bleed to death?
i was trying to get honest answers while he was able to give them... and his wound is far from life threatening.

## you think i don't know that?
at least people like me.

## you know what?
you gotta help me out...

## what do you think, john?
i think he's pretty convincing.

## does jack have the combination to the armory?
for now, he does.

## looking for someone to punish...
how long would it take for you to change it?

## why would i need to punish anyone?
i want to find out who he is.

## so how long, john, to change the combination?
a couple minutes, tops.

## well, where do you think we should put him?
what needs to be done.

## they're letting speak to me alone now?
you need to tell me where the helicopter pilot is.

## they think you will do this?
sayid, you are a loyal soldier.

## did you change it?
yeah.

## why would you do that?
you're raising an army.

## what?
and like it or not, whatever sayid has to do behind that door, that's a part of it, too.

## what if he's not?
get up.

## what's happening?

you're so cute as a blonde.

## well, it's just acting, right?

mr. andersors kind of weird, especially around girls.

## the school play?
i thought that you want to be a movie star.

## can i just say this, okay?
in my office...

## kathy?
kimberly, we've talked about this.

## kathy?
no.

## do you fuck dogs?
you know they're just looking for an excuse.

## last week's meeting, there's a guy there, he's coughing, right?
he starts coughing, like a coughing fit.

## you know, a fucking, coughing kike, right?
so i think...

## i'm sitting here, i'm looking, i'm thinking... is he, like, coughing in fucking yiddish or something?
yes.

## do you fuck dogs?
it's like the fucking titanic.

## kathy?
i got it.

## okay?
i'm going to say something to you.

## you understand that, right?
a big difference.

## okay?
because racism, true racism, stems from ignorance.

## no, i'm just saying that i'm scared... that she's going to repeat some of this shit at school.
this is not to say you have license to bring r. kelly home for dinner, okay?

## as if, what, kids couldn't inerently be fucking complete assholes on their own?
and, by the way, no swearing.

## hello?
hi, mom.

## you know what this is?
the jews.

## what?
at least she's not jumping to some hook nosed motherfucker...

## mom, can you hang on a second?
i got another call.

## hello?
kimberly, hey, it's barry.

## you know, why beer is better than a woman?
okay, great, barry.

## can you hang on a second?
i'm on the other line with my mom.

## hello?
hey, mom, i'm back.

## already?
but we've only been talking for, like, a minute.

## mom?
i love you.

## why is beer better than a woman?
i can't remember.

## you coming over?
yeah, i'll be over a little later.

## kimberly, how many times have i told you not to leave the table for a phone call?
there's nothing like hard canine cock to satisfy my desires.

## so, how's school?
i gotta go.

## where?
out.

## ass crack?
that's interesting.

## is it theoretically possible for you to shut up for more than five seconds at a time?
thanks, barry.

## next time?
i don't know, kimberly.

## next time, i'll go first, okay?
yeah, right.

## tell me how?
we'll talk about it.

## we'll all talk about it, okay?
okay.

## don't those things make you cough?
no, they're cigars.

## are you sure, randa?
to become successful actresses you have to learn how to smoke them.

## why would we want to watch a porno?
besides, we have to teach randa about sex, and this is the best way to learn.

## would you please stop criticizing everything in my big bag of fun?
i spent a lot of time putting this together.

## you didn't hear about it?
some kid in a private school in bel air just walked into his cafeteria... with an assault rifle and opened fire.

## really?
she doesn't look like a lesbian.

## what is a lesbian?
... knows no racial or economic boundaries... that violence can stretch far beyond the limits of the inner city.

## what?
happy birthday.

## what is it?
nothing.

## what is it?
open it.

## now?
okay.

## why don't you change right here?
we are married, for christ's sake.

## good?
that's...

## really?
actually, you're right.

## really?
yeah.

## can you buy the soundtrack to pornos?
tiffany minx, stephanie swift.

## you know what they did?
they took the fat out of her butt and her arms, and they put it in her boobs.

## how can this be?
one of them is doing her up the butt.

## kimberly, would you let someone do that to you?
i have.

## who?
warren.

## warren prescott?
affirmative.

## how?
last year.

## well, what was it like?
it was okay.

## did it hurt?
never mind.

## but you know what?
a few days later, warren broke up with me.

## does that make any sense?
boys are so weird.

## are you here to help me change the oil?
you know, i could never give up men, because i like cock too much.

## why must they show this?
but it is a sin.

## you okay, randa?
yes.

## did you get it all out, every last calorie?
yes, i think so.

## you and troy never actually, like, did anything, right?
no.

## i wonder why that is?
i'm finished.

## amnesty international letters again, are you?
i swear, most of those people deserve to be in prison.

## do you know what that is?
our health, happiness, and faith in god.

## what about him?
he's done stuff to all three of us.

## a metal detector at roxbury?
i'm scared.

## they're going to try and discredit us, and turn us against each other... but we have to stand firm, okay?
we have to stick together, no matter what.

## how are we going to afford a lawyer, on what we make?
wow, that was really good use of the word besmirch.

## guys, what would you say if i told you i got a lawyer?
i mean a great lawyer.

## okay, who?
me, perc.

## roger, this isn't a joke, okay?
this is my life.

## i'm not just a high school law teacher, all right?
so, technically, i'm licensed to practice law in the state of california.

## what's the point?
nobody's going to believe me.

## what kind of attitude is that?
i already have a foolproof strategy.

## i saw this in a movie once, all right?
look, we say one of your arms is dead... useless.

## well, which hand did you grope them with?
roger.

## roger, let me make something clear to you, all right?
i didn't touch these girls.

## let me make something clear to you, okay?
if i'm gonna be your lawyer, i don't wanna know if you did it.

## got it?
now i'm running my fingers along your chest.

## what am i doing to you?
i've got my thumb so far up your ass, i'm bowling with your ass.

## okay?
yeah...

## hank, have you seen bobo?
that stupid dog pissed all over my manolos.

## yeah, okay, and the nips?
that shipment is coming in...

## yeah, i'll see you at the mezuzah, okay?
fucking hebs, you know, i got...

## hello?
never mind.

## fuck, are you kidding?
i got teak.

## you okay, daddy?
yeah.

## what are you saying?
well, you know, daddy's name isn't just his name.

## what?
and i want it to stay that way, kimberly.

## how can you say that?
no, i'm not saying anything.

## kimberly?
kimberly.

## are you done fucking him?
enough of that already.

## what?
i saw her.

## can you believe this all started out as a wimpy little special interest feature?
they give me fluff, and i turn it into dirt.

## you know what that is?
it's hot.

## but let me ask you something, is any of it true?
i wouldn't perjure myself, mr. nicholl, not for any reason.

## would you care to recount this incident to the court?
certainly.

## could you hear what we were saying?
no, but you sure looked at us a lot.

## what about her?
she's a very good student.

## you sure about that?
yeah, she's a fantastic actress, as well.

## guess what happened on the third time?
her test broke the computer.

## she scored that high?
no, she didn't.

## does that break the computer?
okay.

## do you want to know why she was coming on to you?
and forget english, math, science.

## you know what, perc?
any moment now, they're going to walk by... and they're going to bat their eyelashes, and they're going to wave.

## but guess what?
not today.

## show me, where is it?
come on.

## what, do you not speak english?
come on, show me.

## randa, are you okay?
all i'm asking is she locate palestine on a map.

## okay?
come on, show me.

## i mean, where is it?
she can't show me.

## yeah?
well, forgive me, but you were kind of tempting fate... by putting israel next to palestine.

## i mean, what kind of fucking diplomacy is that?
god help us if you ever become un leader.

## what are you laughing at, sudan?
and, josh, at least my dad isn't a money grubbing jew shyster... who lets criminals go free.

## can you tell us, say, about a typical complaint you might field from a parent?
complaints are few and far between at roxbury.

## charles, you wanted to see me about something?
i want you to replace kimberly joyce in the play.

## what do you mean?
you know what i mean.

## do i make myself clear?
yes, sir.

## kimberly, is there anything that you'd like to tell mr. horowitz?
i don't know what came over me.

## always starts with the parents, doesn't it?
but still, i do think that you owe mr. horowitz an apology.

## potato latke?
too fattening.

## why don't you two just hurry on back to class now?
i'm sorry, kimberly, my hands are tied on this one.

## do you know what it was?
no.

## come on, do you really expect me to believe that?
i'm not going to forget this.

## didn't it make you angry... when mr. anderson told you he was replacing you with brittany wells?
i don't know.

## you don't know?
look at that, she doesn't know.

## didm't you want to get back at him?
no.

## and that you thought that the play might even bring you closer to him?
no.

## isn't this correct, miss joyce?
yes, that's correct.

## do me a favor, would you?
read that out loud to the court.

## embarrassed?
well, well, well.

## why are you embarrassed, kimberly?
i wanted to get it done quickly, and i didn't do a very good job.

## can i go?
yeah.

## can i go?
one moment, your honor.

## what the fuck was that supposed to prove?
it wasn't anything like that.

## would you read that again, please?
and this time i'd love for you to do it seductively.

## all right?
just try to make the words sexy.

## mr. nicholl?
some leeway, please, your honor.

## miss joyce, would you please try and do what he asks?
please, i appreciate that.

## are you all right, dear?
bet you've never seen one like that before.

## it is?
yes, and you're cute.

## i am?
yes.

## so did you ask him?
no.

## you want to make me happy, don't you, josh?
of course i do, you're amazing.

## miss azzouni, now... you were also present at this detention in question, were you not?
yes.

## another room?
there is a small room beside mr. andersors classroom... separated by glass.

## now, what are we going to do about that?
i'm going to let you in on a little secret.

## you're sitting there, loathing me right now, aren't you?
because good grades are very important to your parents.

## what are we going to do about that?
if your compositional skills don't improve within the next year...

## do i make myself clear?
look at me.

## and do you recall any of the details of this discussion?
i do not recollect the details.

## mr. anderson said to you during that discussion, anything at all?
well, one thing i remember is that he told an off color joke.

## an off color joke?
mr. anderson told you an off color joke.

## how?
she lies upon the bed, he ejaculates upon the wall.

## and what happened next, miss azzouni?
now i'm going to touch you on your boobs.

## good stuff.
boobs?

## miss azzouni, engage me here a little bit here, would you?
i'm just curious.

## which hand did mr. anderson allegedly fondle you with?
both hands.

## both hands?
no more questions.

## well, all you got to do is tell the truth, right?
right.

## so what's there to be nervous about?
kimberly and randa, they already did a good job on the stand.

## look, i'm not kimberly, okay?
this whole thing is really scary for me, with the judge and all the lawyers.

## what?
no, hey.

## right?
you're right.

## did it make you sad when kimberly broke up with you?
you mean, when i broke up with her.

## what?
no way.

## what, that's not the way it went?
no, it's not even close.

## what happened?
well, i heard something... that kind of freaked me out... and to be honest with you, it was kind of making me look bad.

## you don't like what you see?
warren prescott told me what he did to you.

## are you going to believe everything that warren says?
i believe this.

## assuming that it's true... why is that a problem?
if you're good, i'll let you go where warren went.

## i don't take some loser's sloppy seconds, all right?
and i don't want to be with some dirty little whore.

## what did you say to me?
you heard me.

## now i have to ask you, why did you take so long to come forward?
we were scared.

## and what finally made you break your silence?
when he decided to do it in front of everybody.

## could you repeat for us the incident that drove you over the edge?
it was at drama club, after school on a friday.

## private moment?
yes, private moment.

## do you want to be our lead?
yes, but i...

## well, what's he doing here?
roger, what are you...

## all right?
lmagine yourself in the privacy of your own room... the door is locked, it's closed.

## court is adjourned till monday.
so you can stay here and act like a professional... or are you going to run and cry, like a little girl?

## hello?
kimberly, hi, it's barry.

## how can i put this tactfully?
barry, i never really liked you all that much... and i think we should break up.

## barry?
it always goes down easy.

## what?
that was one of the reasons why beer is better than a woman.

## i like it, it's cute.
i've really got to go, okay?

## is it?
yes, and you're cute.

## i am?
yes.

## busy?
i'm always busy, josh.

## what is it, josh, what is it?
sorry.

## is this my natural hair color?
well, francine, a lady doesn't reveal her beauty secrets.

## so where do you see yourself in 10 years?
i would like to be a doctor, because i think it is a good thing to help society.

## it does?
yes.

## sylvester stallone?
no.

## you want to sue mr. anderson?
the timing's perfect.

## okay, what's the worst case scenario?
we lose the case, we still get famous... and mr. anderson has to live with the stigma for the rest of his life.

## the rest of his life?
brittany, don't pussy out on me.

## will mr. anderson be fired?
in all likelihood, yes.

## would we have to, like, testify?
probably not.

## rewind?
cocktails.

## how many are going to continue to suffer in silence... all because of this asinine little stunt you've pulled?
i don't know, emily.

## how many?
i'm going to bury you.

## and why would i want to do that?
as far as lapses in journalistic integrity go...

## wouldn't you?
like he's going to believe you.

## do you know i thought that you were like i was in high school?
a loner, smarter than everyone else, just misunderstood.

## have you looked at yourself in the mirror lately?
my god.

## what kind of person are you?
but the thing in drama, that was true.

## mad?
i don't want to look at you anymore.

## you wanna just crawl in the dirt and stay there... where no one can see, don't you?
look on the bright side, brittany.

## jewelry, earrings, anything like that?
see, there you go.

## all right, you sure you got everything now?
everything.

## is there a problem here?
this is part of our religion.

## bobo, come here.
will you shut the fuck up?

## hello?
she shouldn't have done that.

## who?
the diaper head.

## have you any idea, this little charade you cooked up... how it's made me look, huh?
i'm sorry about your business, daddy.

## free time?
she thinks i'm gonna spend the free time with her.

## can you fucking imagine?
you got a fuzzy little brain in your head, explain it to her.

## why would i want to do that?
you know, there was a time... when i actually thought i could protect you.

## okay?
it's over.

## who knows where she got the gun?
i mean, accessibility to firearms... is one of the main problems facing the youth of society today.

## kimberly joyce tried out for marie france, didn't she?
yeah.

## and why didn't we pick her again?
didn't stand out.

## is it too late to re cast that role?
it's never too late.

## did i tell you i'm moving to my mom's?
i was talking to josh horowitz.

## yeah?
he told me something.

## what did he tell you, brit?
he said you asked him to ask his father to represent mr. anderson.

## so i was trying to think, why?
but i couldn't find an answer.

## to be on that stupid show?
partly.

## it's so fleeting, you know?
heartbreak, on the other hand...

## you're not his perfect little angel anymore, are you?
oh, no.

## everything was about a boy?
not very original, granted.

## you never wanted to be anne frank, did you?
oh, yes, i did.

## really?
that's sweet, man.

## just like shooting the ducks in a carnival, you know?
my family came here for american dream.

## what do you have to say?
but i have nothing for you.

## what's that?
good morning, gentlemen.

## what was that?
we got a social studies quiz.

## how do you know?
trust me on this, man.

## are you a student here?
chris.

## the basketball team?
i didn't try out for the basketball team.

## they're different?
look, we were five and 20 last season, but with you...

## give your program a shot?
i can't play.

## what's your name again?
um, six of them are.

## do y'all take food stamps?
hey, hey.

## comb my hair?
we don't got no daggone brushes.
