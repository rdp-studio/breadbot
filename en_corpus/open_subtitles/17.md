## wait, what about the doll?
he's got it at the desk.

## would you relax about that?
guys, we're in a hurry.

## what do you mean calling me\"curious\"?
i met you before the show.

## you're a little defensive about this?
yeah, i'm waiting for those cleveland jokes.

## you know this guy?
i'm beginning to wonder.

## where the hell do you get that stuff?

## what are you trying to do over there?
i'm trying to get some news.

## then what's the matter?
joke, man.

## am i giving you a hard time?
no.

## am i making you nervous?
no.

## would you pay $34 for that?
no, but i'm not asking it.

## so, what do you think?
megalomaniac.

## but what the hell did i care?
letterman was an okay guy.

## what has happened to you since?
not much, david.

## are these free?
as a result of my appearances on letterman... my buddy toby radloff, landed a gig extolling the virtues of mtv.

## who the fuck is this on my set?
look at this, the man of the hour.

## what can i say?
it was the '80s, man.

## harvey, are you listening to me?
i've been reading about these kids who grew up in these war zones.

## you're that guy from the letterman show, right?
yeah, that's me.

## then how about you buy one of my comics, man?
that's the only reason i go on that dumb show, anyway.

## what are you talking about, jerusalem?
lately i can barely drag you off the futon to go with me to the letterman show.

## do you want to know why?
because i don't give a damn about the letterman show.

## you ever think of that?
don't...

## can't you just do something here in cleveland?
you'il survive a couple of weeks by yourself.

## be careful out there, all right?
i love you.

## what do i care?

## what is your problem?
miguel, look...

## i just don't want to keep coming back here for it, okay?
harvey, that patient's due to be admitted a week from now.

## fine.

## what do you mean, another two weeks?
goddamn it.

## you all set?
yeah.

## how about that?
you know, like ge owning this network, nbc.

## you think nbc news is gonna cover what they do fairly?
i got other things i wanna talk about.

## are you afraid of the truth, david?
it's not about what you're saying.

## you didn't do me any favors, okay?
i'm still a file clerk.

## you want me to leave, david?
come on, ask me like a man.

## are things okay at home, harvey?
things are just great at home.

## who the hell cares?
that show wasn't helping my sales anyway.

## i just can't take being alone, you know?
if you met those kids over there, you wouldn't ask that of me.

## harvey, what is that?
i don't understand.

## does\"tumor\"mean the same thing as\"cancer\"?
we know the growth is malignant.

## how can i have cancer?
i don't feel sick at all.

## what's gonna happen to you, baby?
who's gonna take care of you...

## yeah, but that's you, you know?

don't go.

## please don't go, okay?
here's our man.

i don't know.

## what were you like?
come on.

## where are we?
it's an estate.

## are we trespassing?
don't worry, we're not going inside.

## what is this place?
i made this place.

## what do you mean?
i know this is gonna sound really strange, but i dreamed of this place.

## is it gonna be again?
sure.

## hello?
david, it's grace.

## why do you say that?
great news, the apartment is yours.

## how long a lease?
really long.

## why are they giving me a long lease now?
it's a terrible story.

## what?
we gotta go talk to your sister.

## what are you gonna say to her?
i don't know.

## what kind of dirt do you have on her?
her middle name is ellen.

## what else?
she's lactose intolerant.

## so, how did you know elizabeth?
they're supposed to be at school.

## would you like some tea, sir?
well, yes, thank you, madam.

## how did you know her?
lie your butt off.

## can you see me?
i was sick.

## spiral meningitis?
it's not a disease.

## but why are you telling me this?
because i know about elizabeth's situation, and i just wanna say that...

## it's david, right?
you see, it's too late because i've already signed the papers.

## can you feel me?
i'm right here.

## right next to me?
right there.

## could you just hold on, just a sec?
ok, tea party's over.

## what?
i know what you did with j. j.

## what?
i don't think your sister's a very spiritual person.

## lizzie?
ok, i'm sorry.

## brett?
no.

## what do you mean?
come on.

## the spirit's with you, isn't it?
you can't bring that here.

## what are you thinking?
you were right.

## so, what, are you guys socializing now?
we've... acclimated.

## really?
no, i don't.

## can we focus here?
ok.

## my spirit...... back into her body?
you're asking the wrong question.

## why is that wrong?
look, i have the gift.

## why they're hangir here in the first place?
that's their unfinished business.

## do i have the gift?
dude, please.

## but if i don't have it, how is it that i can see her and talk to her when no one else can?
exactly.

## exactly what?
that's the right question.

## what the hell is he talking about?
god, i feel like it's right there in front of us.

## how do you solve a problem that isn't possible in the first place?
because nothing seems impossible to me anymore.

## i mean, why was i down in that restaurant when that guy collapsed?
it all seems interrelated somehow.

## what are you doing?
i don't know.

## where did you get this?
it was just at the hospital.

## and that's a good thing?
no.

## but what was i doing with the rest of my time?
when i think about my life and i...

## you know?
working and working and trying so hard.

## and for what?
you help people.

## see the eiffel tower?
no problem.

## i'm so bad at this.
you wanna dance on a beach in bali?

## are you nervous?
a little.

## why?
i don't know.

## how can you be nervous when i can't even touch you?
i think i'm more nervous because you can't touch me.

## you know in the hospital when you touched my hand?
i felt it.

## what?
you.

## what are you talking about?
lizzie, when we first met, i kept saying that you were dead.

## how?
i'm gonna steal your body.

## why can't i?
because you'il go to jail.

## if something happens to you, you think i care where i'il be?
at least this'il buy us a little more time.

## what are we movir again?
medical supplies.

## you didn't tell him?
you have to.

## saw who at the bar?
there's a one day sale on hospital beds.

## not yet what?
we're not there yet.

## has your imaginary friend come out to play?
ok, grab a can't.

## i knew you wouldn't come if i told you.
dave, what the hell are you doing?

## do i really want to hear this?
my imaginary friend is not imaginary.

## really?
really.

## she knows what a stretch this is for you.
does he believe you now?

## rock, paper or scissors?
rock.

## how...?
ok.

## why?
because i love her.

## what?
tell him thank you.

## then why are you doing it?
because someday, trust me, i'm gonna need help movir a body.

## she's pretty, right?
and she didn't make it either, because she had an accident.

## is that why?
i was supposed to meet you.

## how did you know her?
no one's called me j. j. since college.

## how the hell did you know that?
it's elizabeth.

## dr. rushton?
yeah.

## who's we?
tell him your team is downstairs.

## you won't mind if i talk to dr. walsh?
this is dr. rushton.

## well, what can i do?
that's not possible.

## can you hear me?
i can't believe we almost let you go.

## honey?
it's me, abby.

## you don't remember david?
the apartment.

## we only rented it for a month.
honey, you don't remember him at all?

## did you move something?
no.

## you sure you're gonna be ok?
yeah.

## how did you get up here?
spare key.

## yeah?
the key.

## how do i know you?
maybe from your dreams.

## you all right?
no.

## me?
i knew you'd be okay.

## hey, buddy?
i'm out of the bowl.

## you wanna trap the ape?
i don't think so.

## live animal capture?
the mayor, thank you.

## what am i?
thank you very much.

## ready?
i'm really appreciating that...

## am i a lucky guy?
maybe you're the lucky guy.

## oh, really?
yes, i am.

## isn't it obvious?
oh, i'm sorry.

## and that's when he told you how he felt?
no.

## he never said it?
he probably thought he didn't need to say it.

## well, then how does she know that it's real?
he said it was not about the words.

## he didn't try to save it?
i honestly believed things might actually work out... which was really very...

## where's ann?
i have no idea.

## everyone needs to leave, okay?
look at me.

## why'd he do that?
climb up there and get himself cornered.

## what does it matter?
airplanes got him.

## odd ball, do you copy?
i see them...

## oh?!?
sorry, master.

## next move?
spring the trap.

## what's the situation, captain?
two jedi have landed in the main hangar bay.

## what's that?
artoo.

## do you copy?
artoo.

## artoo, do you hear me?
artoo, we need to be going up, not down.

## what was that all about?
well, artoo has been...

## chancellor.
did i say anything?

## are you all right?
count dooku.

## did i miss something?
hold on.

## artoo, get down here.
what is that?

## artoo, do you copy?
oh yes.

## well?
under the circumstances, i'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant.

## are you coming, master?
oh no.

## chancellor palpatine, are you all right?
yes, thanks to your two jedi knights.

## are you all right?
you're trembling.

## what's going on?
something wonderful has happened.

## we're not going to worry about anything right now, all right?
this is a happy moment.

## but the loss of count dooku?
his death was a necessary loss.

## so love has blinded you?
nothing...

## how long is it going to take for us to be honest with each other?
it was a dream.

## bad?
like the ones i used to have about my mother just before she died.

## and?
it was about you.

## and the baby?
i don't know.

## do you think obi wan might be able to help us?
i don't need his help...

## someone... close to you?
yes.

## what must i do, master yoda?
train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.

## what's wrong then?
the senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the chancellor today.

## is that bad?
it will make it easier for us to end this war.

## be careful of what?
he has requested your presence.

## what for?
he would not say.

## that's unusual, isn't it?
all of this is unusual, and it's making me feel uneasy.

## what do you mean?
i'm depending on you.

## for what?
i don't understand.

## a master?
this is outrageous, it's unfair...

## how can you be on the council and not be a master?
take a seat, young skywalker.

## may the force be with us all.
what about the droid attack on the wookiees?

## what kind of nonsense is this, put me on the council and not make me a master!?
that's never been done in the history of the jedi.

## and?
anakin, i am on your side.

## what situation?
the council wants you to report on all of the chancellor's dealings.

## we are at war, anakin.
they want me to spy on the chancellor?

## why didn't the council give me this assignment when we were in session?
this assignment is not to be on record.

## why are you asking this of me?
the council is asking you.

## is he not to destroy the sith and bring balance to the force?
so the prophecy says.

## what do you mean?
i don't believe that.

## what is it?
nothing.

## you know, don't you?
i know they don't trust you...

## they asked you to spy on me, didn't they?
i don't know...

## and the jedi don't?
the jedi are selfless...

## did you ever hear the tragedy of darth plagueis\"the wise\"?
no.

## he could actually save people from death?
the dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.

## it's ironic... he could save others from death, but not himself.
what happened to him?

## is it possible to learn this power?
not from a jedi.

## come on, when have i ever let you down?
very well, the burden is on me not to destroy all the droids before you'il arrive.

## obi wan's been here, hasn't he?
he came by this morning.

## what did he want?
he's worried about you.

## what do you mean?
obi wan and the council don't trust me.

## save me?
from my nightmares.

## is that what's bothering you?
i won't lose you, padme.

## what brings you to our remote sanctuary?
unfortunately, the war.

## va a traer mas guerreros?
he didn't say.

## safe?
chancellor palpatine managed to escape your grip, general, without count dooku.

## master windu, may i interrupt?
general kenobi has made contact with general grievous, and we have begun our attack.

## don't you wonder why they won't make you a jedi master?
i wish i knew.

## how do you know the ways of the force?
my mentor taught me everything about the force... even the nature of the dark side.

## what did you say?
use my knowledge, i beg you...

## are you going to kill me?
i would certainly like to.

## but you're not sure of their intentions, are you?
i will quickly discover the truth of all this.

## a sith lord?
yes.

## how do you know this?
he knows the ways of the force.

## are you sure?
absolutely.

## master windu, may i interrupt?
general kenobi has made contact with general grievous, and we have begun our attack.

## don't you wonder why they won't make you a jedi master?

i will quickly discover the truth of all this.

## a sith lord?
yes.

## how do you know this?
he knows the ways of the force.

## are you sure?
absolutely.

## are you threatening me, master jedi?
the senate will decide your fate.

## what about the other jedi spread across the galaxy?
their betrayal will be dealt with.

## what are we going to do?
the chancellor's office indicated master anakin returned to the jedi temple.

## did you find kenobi?
sir, no one could have survived that fall.

## master kenobi?
repeat.

## we're sending you our coordinates.
master kenobi?

## are you all right?
i heard there was an attack on the jedi temple... you can see the smoke from here.

## what's happening?
the jedi have tried to overthrow the republic...

## oh, anakin what are you going to do?
i will not betray the republic... my loyalties lie with the chancellor and with the senate and with you.

## what about obi wan?
i don't know.

## my lady, is there anything i might do?
no thank you, threepio.

## how many other jedi managed to survive?
heard from no one, have we.

## have we had any contact from the temple?
received a coded retreat message, we have.

## suggest dismantling the coded signal, do you?
yes, master.

## what's happening?
the chancellor has been elaborating on a plot by the jedi, to overthrow the senate.

## use your feelings, obi wan, and find him, you will.
who?

## when was the last time you saw him?
yesterday.

## and do you know where he is now?
no.

## from the sith?
i have seen a security hologram of him killing younglings.

## you're going to kill him, aren't you?
he has become a very great threat.

## anakin is the father, isn't he?
i'm so sorry.

## what are you doing out here?
i was so worried about you.

## what things?
he said you have turned to the dark side... that you killed younglings.

## us?
he knows.

## at what cost?
you are a good person.

## because of obi wan?
because of what you've done... what you plan to do.

## your new empire?
don't make me kill you.

## surprised?
your arrogance blinds you, master yoda.

## if so powerful you are, why leave?
you will not stop me.

## for reasons we can't explain, we are losing her.
obi wan?

## she's dying?
we don't know why.

## babies?
she's carrying twins.

## lord vader, can you hear me?
yes, master.

## is she safe, is she all right?
it seems in your anger, you killed her.

## and what of the boy?
to tatooine.

## training?
how to commune with him.

## what?
oh no.

## odd ball, do you copy?
i see them...

## oh?!?
sorry, master.

## next move?
spring the trap.

## what's the situation, captain?
two jedi have landed in the main hangar bay.

yes.

## how do you know this?
he knows the ways of the force.

## are you sure?
alright then.

## what is it?
they have bought our lives.

## who am i?
since the beginning...... humans and pokmon alike have searched for its meaning.

## what am i?
many strange and wondrous legends evolved...... from the pursuit of life 's mysteries.

## where am i?
but none is stranger than this tale...... of the most powerful pokmon of all.

## where...... am i?
this is not the same.

## why?
doctor, look at this.

## let us hear its psychic powers.
what?

## psychic powers?
for years we struggled to successfully clone a pokmon to prove our theories.

## nothing but mew's shadow?
you are greater than mew.

## we'il observe mewtwo for mutations.
what becomes of me now?

## ls the new tank ready?
we'il have to come up with a cage for it.

## those fools thought you were a science experiment...... but i see you as a valuable partner.
is that my purpose?

## partner?
with your psychic powers and my resources...... together we can control the world.

## how?
i'il show you a way to focus your powers...... that will make you invincible.

## what is that?
now i fully perceive my power.

## but what is my purpose?
to serve your master.

## what is my true reason for being?
i will find my own purpose.

## you know him?
yeah, he's me.

## master, shall i extend an invitation to these trainers as well?
as you wish.

## something for me?
greetings, pokmon trainers.

## for years...... i prayed mankind would never witness that deadly storm ever again.
is there a rewind button?

## isn't that just a legend?
ancient writings tell of the storm wiping out all but a few pokmon.

## how come?
the nurse in charge of the center disappeared last month.

## ve take you?
ve vikings are used to big vaves.

## are you sure this boat's safe?
not yet.

## aren't you the nurse from the treatment center?
you do look just like her.

## aren't we waiting for the others?
only the trainers capable of braving the storm...... are worthy in my master's eyes.

## do you mean that storm was some kind of test?
release your pokmon from their pokballs and join the others.

## you know another way in?
look over there.

## but how are we going to swim up that thing?
pretend you're a catfish.

## something wrong, jessie?
no.

## how did you get here?
i decided to fly over.

## what's that?
yes.

## how's it talking?
you have been under my control.

## are they real?
i was hoping there'd be a party.

## begin replication sequence.
what are you?

## who's that pokmon?
it's meowth.

## y es, but who?
you humans are a dangerous species.

## so you hate all humans?
and you're going to destroy us to save pokmon.

## you are his friend?
you are as pathetic as the rest.

## are you okay?
don't pick on pikachu.

## which of you will oppose me first?
your pokmon.

## what's happening?
i wonder if they feel....

## what is that?
i don't know.

## are you afraid to find out which of us is greater?
so you do have some fight in you.

## or your pathetic group of spineless inferior pokmon?
we were created with powers far stronger than the originals.

## what's it saying?
you don't prove anything by showing off a lot of special powers.

## what can come out of it?
nothing but pain.

## can't mewtwo understand it's not right to force pokmon to battle?
they're all living creatures.

## you owth ain't pushing meowth around.
what am i doing?

## but how can i trust you?
you was born different.

## how do i know you're not going to pull a fast one on me?
you're right, we do have a lot in common.

## are you okay?
we got to stop this.

## how?
mewtwo wants to prove how strong those super clones are.

## mewtwo, where are you going?
where my heart can learn what yours knows so well.

## guys, how did we wind up in this place anyway?
well, i guess we're just here because we're here.

## what's what?
i don't see anything, ash.

## have any unscreen?
i'd really like to go sailing in one of them catamarans.

## you travelling with two sheila's are ya mate?

## brandon made these picks?
you're looking at him.

## can i watch, daddy?
come to daddy.

## you see that team?
those are the bad guys.

## and new york has gotta win by more than five points, only you gotta root for a low score, ok?

## all right?
he puts it up for grabs.

## yeah?
i don't eat.

## you got insomnia, indigestion, you're gonna quit?
hail mary pass.

## with the streak he's been on?

## what if we lose?

## 28 years in the business, we're not going anywhere.

## will they go over to the pass?
well, there is no way they'il be able to run when they're 14 points down.

## hey, brandon?
i believe this'il be their final possession.

## can they get it done like they have all year long?
they're trailing by four.

## how about that?
no goodbye, no... no nothing.

## what do you mean, what do i mean?
he had enough.

## he said that to you?
well, loud and clear, by leaving.

## yeah?
tell me.

## you have no idea?
you're missing the game, walter.

## what about this?
brandon didn't tell me he was gonna leave because... you let him fuck you.

## you deny it?

## do i have to, walter?
you know you did.

## another lock of the year?
i saw you, toni.

## just put me out there on a tray?

## didn't it?
with eight seconds left, new york has to spend their final time out.

## but you don't deny it?
it's the best pick he ever made.

## so i figured, you know,\"what the hell?
he slipped out the back, no big deal.

## otherwise, why wouldn't he confront us, confront me?
oh, walter.

## can new york find the end zone?
this is what players dream of.

## understand?
i will never let that happen to you.

## we're gonna play this wonderful game of football.

## i 'm kicking ass and taking names.
do we wanna win?

## did you get the money that i sent you?
yeah.

## now, who 's this john anthony person?

## have you seen this child, doctor?
i check on her every day.

## have you had any success in the lab?
absolutely.

## so what you're saying is you're performing an experiment... not an operation?
my instincts tell me nature made a mistake and i can fix it.

## would you like to see what i've been doing, father?
right now my instincts tell me perhaps you should come back another day.

## what?
your quest for glory is vain, arrogant.

## what happened to you, ponchos?
maybe we should just stop here, doctor.

## what do you feel?
i can't tell if blood is flowing through the shunt.

## are we inflating the left lung with oxygen?

## who would have thought it possible?

one more time.

## you have a good time?
i would've had a better time if somebody hadn't been ignoring me all night.

## was that me?

## think we're all just a bunch of deviant lifestyle living, same sex having motherfuckers, am i right?
yeah.

## see what i mean?
perverts.

## what's up, buddy?
nothin ', man.

## what's wrong?
amen, brother.

## can you do that for me, mitch?

## what are you looking at, fuckwad?
that's naomi.

## really?
uh huh.

## yeah, but why does it always have to be about my looks?
just 'cause i dress slutty doesn't mean i am slutty.

## what's up, poncho?
hey, raddimus.

## actually, more importantly, how are you and danielle doing?

they're always trying to project their own values on you.

## tall guy, kind of smelled like my dad's ass?
that's the one.

## yeah, so?
well, you know, we were in all the same classes in high school.

## but electrical engineering?
come on.

## what the hell can you do with an a. a. degree anyway?
you can get a job substitute teaching for retarded kids or something.

## i assume monty went over the basic idea with you, right?
yeah, he...

## you know the object, right?
to have the other guy look at you naked.

## what are you, some kind of a fucking sick, demented pervert, huh?
no.

## all right?
now, look.

## all right?
all you gotta do, pull down your pants real quick, show 'em the goods.

## second one is called\"the brain.\"right?
what you gotta do is isolate your nuts with your fist.

## okay, now, take the time to look at it, okay?
because it bears a striking resemblance to...

## what you do is you take the excess skin from your nuts, and you take it and you make it flat like paper, all right?
now, once again, you take the time to appreciate this.

## you gotta call 'em a fag, okay?
very important.

## you got that?
i just don't understand why your mom gives you so much shit anyway.

## you were still asleep, weren't you?
that's an understatement.

## so what did you do last night?
i trust my little angel didn't do anything immoral.

## so why aren't you and serena still together?
i liked her.

## you are being safe, aren't you?
i don't think i could handle the idea of you reproducing.

## you think i wanna have kids?
absolutely not.

## what you do is you take your nuts and your dick, right?
and you tuck it underneath.

## pull your pants down, show it, all right?
with it sticking out the backside.

## you got that?
okay, well, that just about covers all the different variations that we have.

## see what you come up with, okay?
it's all good.

## dean, can i have a word with you?
sure.

## how long you been a waiter?
since i was 18, so about four years.

## are you okay?
if you're not interested...

## can i take a little while to think about it?
yeah.

## why don't we hang out?
oh.

## why don't we hang out more often?
we're practically the same guy.

## you know what?
you'd think i do.

## has anyone seen dean?
oh, he's in the back talking to dan.

## yeah, you wanna know what they're talking about?
dan wants to make dean assistant fuckin 'manager.

## well, did he take the job?
i don't know.

## take my car, what do you think's gonna happen?
yeah, i don't really think...

## hey, so what was that about?
nothing important.

## what?
hey, there, folks.

## can get you something to drink while you're looking at the menus?
hi, there, guys.

## is there anything i can get you to drink while you're looking at the menus?
yeah, i want a single shot of whiskey and a double shot of whiskey, and she'il have a water.

## you know, what the hell?
it's our anniversary.

## you'il be taking care of us?
i like the sound of that.

## can i get an extra side of blue cheese?
sir, yes, sir.

## are you okay?
i'm about this close to swearing off men altogether.

## all right, see what serena's doing right there?
she's baiting those poor saps.

## yeah?
yeah, you kind of remind me of him.

## women troubles, amy?
i just don't understand what would compel a person to be such a bitch to a total stranger.

## so, what do you think of natasha?
i think she's illegal.

## what's up, obsession?
shut up.

## has even hinted that he's aware of it?
no, he's acting oblivious.

## are you gonna talk to her or hope you're never forced to make an actual decision?
i'm going with option\"b\".

## have you talked to him about it?
no.

## oh, but haven't you slept with him the past five nights?
well, not real hard to get.

## who are you thinking about?
wait.

## are you fucking kidding me?
you know this place.

## do i really wanna end up like dan?
busted.

## hey, rocco?
it's dan down at shenaniganz.

## what the hell took so long?
well, you had the two well done steaks, so it usually takes a little while to cook.

## yeah, well, could you get me some more ketchup?
sure.

## could you drop off my food, please?
i can't deal with that bitch anymore.

## yeah, and let it dry out under the heat lamps?
just give me the food.

## did that waitress listen to a word i said?
this steak is medium rare.

## oh, come on, guys.
how hard is your job?

## she wasn't that bad, was she?
well, amy, it's your table.

## so it's on then?
we're getting the fucking hydro.

## how about a little guacamole for the steak?
whoa, whoa, whoa.

## what are you doing?
come on, man.

## how about a little garlic salt?
that's what i'm talking about.

## i'm sorry?
yes, sir.

## everything prepared okay?
could be better.

## is there anything i can do to make it better?
yeah, get me an extra roll.

## what about the stall?
no, it didn't work either.

## voices?
i get this paranoid feeling there are people outside the stall, and they know i'm having a difficult time taking a piss.

## most people have to pay for such a thing.
i can hear them saying,\"what's taking him so long?

## so what the hell should i do?
well, first, you need to think about how this problem affects other parts of your personality.

## how does that work?
sweet victory.

## how are you doing today?
oh, i'm slipping gradually into senility.

## do you consider that a good thing or a bad thing?
well, it's a mixed bag.

## yeah, so what's the bad?
well, sometimes i give small children the middle finger and don't realize i'm doing it until someone slaps me.

## so what could i get you to drink?
i trust you.

## you know what?
you can count on me, sir.

## how's your table?
couple of hicks.

## okay, mitch, you see what dean did there?
don't ever do that.

## what, did he stiff you?
he might as fucking well have.

## and how about a couple of sundaes with some nuts on 'em?
yeah, i will have natasha take down all your information, and i will make sure corporate sends those to you.

## you're gonna mail me a sundae?
i want it now.

## insulting a customer like that?
you're right.

## you're sorry?
i don't understand.

## i promise you it won't happen again, okay?
well, i guess...

## okay?
so...

## you think you're still in the running for the assistant manager?
hey, i don't.

## hello?
i don't know what's going on.

## hey, could you put down the ice pick?
sorry you had to hear that guy yell.

## why?
i prefer older men.

## really?
wow.

## what are you still doing here?
christy asked me to work for her, so i'm working a double.

## isn't this your only night off this week?
yeah.

## and you're using it to work a double shift for christy?
wait.

## didn't you take out christy last night?
yeah, we went out last night.

## what do you mean?
don't give me that shit.

## anything?
no, i'm still...

## why?
i'm not...

## all we ever do is hang out and have sex.
what happens with every girl you like?

## huh?
yeah, but you kept trying to get me to jerk you off.

## what do you want?
it was a dull movie.

## when my uncle died, didn't i ask you to be by my side at the funeral?
yeah, but you kept trying to get me to jerk you off.

## how many times can we have the same exact conversation?
it's like we're stuck in a time paradox where neither our wisdom nor your virginity will ever escape.

## how can someone be such a complete asshole all the time and get as many women as you do?
that's a good question.

## women like assholes, am i right?
and the more you do that, calvin, the more it becomes this self fulfilling prophecy.

## okay?
yeah.

## correct me if i'm wrong, but haven't i been inside you?
oh, monty.

## okay, you know what?
fine.

## is it any wonder why you still date girls in high school?
all i had to do was call and say,\"hey.

## now why is that?
because at first, i really liked spending time with you.

## and, oh, monty, do you remember why we stopped dating?
yeah, i do.

## maybe they're laughing about you when they're really not?
well, in your case, they really are.

## cool?
well, i mean, i guess.

## are you ready?
well, okay.

## how about some dessert?
and here you go, folks.

## where are we going?

## what?
she is fleeing to the east.

and vcano?

## you are going alone with kaena?

kaena, your world is dying.

## what did you do with my people?
they are only slaves.

## where is the invader?

jesus, no.

the names of the perpetrators, found with a minimum of trouble.

i have reason to believe moore phoned you the night of the murder.

resign her commission, or agree to some sort of therapy.

there's a rope around my neck.

the one thing i am proudest of in my whole life... is that you are happy with me.

## it's beautiful.
so, john, i'il see you at the party, huh?

## why aren't you at the party?
oh, because it's a dance, and to dance you need a partner and... my partner is right here.

his blood sugar's 3 times norm, phosphorus and uric acid are off the charts.

come on, baby.

## you want to meet him?
yeah.

## deac?
frost, it's about blade.

## aw, he's busy, you know?
because, like, when he's focused on business...

## it was a trap, see?
but don't worry about it.

## you hear me, quinn?
i want him alive.

## what?
wait a minute, man.

## what's that smell?
hlgh pltched volce :... image carefully, frost.

## fuck.
krieger, is that you?

## what is that?
that, biscuit boy, is a u. v. lamp.

## oh, that?
well, that's what frost says.

## then you won't mind me borrowing this for a while, will you?
if he moves, fry him.

## what's in here?
nothing.

## what is this?
these are the pages from the book of erebus, the vampire bible.

## give me your hand.
why is frost so interested in la magra?

## you took my arm, man.
do you remember me?

## remember?
but it's cool.

## ohh.
think i'il ever play piano again?

## you're just full of surprises, isn't you, chief?
stay with me, sweetness...

## nice craftsmanship, huh?
probably cost you a pretty penny.

## i owe you two.
now, this here is a man who takes his job... just a little too seriously, don't you think?

## oh, what's so funny, bright eyes?
i'm expecting company.

## you've been listening in the whole time?
keeping radio contact.

## what are you gonna do?
oh, my god.

## what's wrong?
it's dislocated.

## you're one of them, aren't you?
no.

## why do you hunt them?
i had a family once wife and two daughters.

## what the fuck are you talk you want him alive?
we've been trying to kill this motherfucker for years.

## are you out of your fucking mind?
shh.

## how you feeling?
look at that.

## getting a little toasty out here, huh?
heh heh.

## when was the last time you stopped to appreciate a good sunrise?
oh, that's right.

## you were born a vampire, so you never had the pleasure, have you?
that's ok.

## what, man?
i need 12 volunteers.

## what is this?
smells like a vampire wiped his ass with it.

## so what's all this?
took a trip to the hospital last night, borrowed some equipment.

## for your miracle cure?
this is e. d. t. a.

## is he sick?
cancer.

## you have a lot of love for him, don't you?
we have a good arrangement.

## how you doing, chief?
easy.

## wouldn't want our little friend here to wind up on the back of a milk carton, now would we?
ah, it's nice to finally meet you, man.

## hey, it's a start, right?
the goal, of course, is to be like you, the daywalker.

## you got the best of both worlds, don't you?
all our strengths... none of our weaknesses.

## oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again?
come on.

## spare me the uncle tom routine, ok?
you can't keep denying what you are, man.

## you think the humans will ever accept a half breed like you?
they can't.

## what difference does it make how their world ends?
plague... war... famine.

## what do you think, i'm stupid?
you're familiar with the blood god.

## you know that?
i came down here offering you an easy way out, and you spit it right back in my fucking face.

## what do i care?
they're nothing but cattle... just like you said.

## why do vampires need to drink blood?
cause their own blood can't sustain haemoglobin.

## you actually think this could work?
on me... yes.

## you know?
blade not... giving it to you maybe.

## is this the part where you offer to turn me?
well, it's either that or a body bag.

## how'd you get that scar, deacon?
a born vampire would have the power to regenerate from birth.

## isn't that right?
vampires like you aren't a species.

## hmm?
and blade's blood is the key.

## there's no intruder where we are.
what?

## look, make it happen, all right?
but you died.

## you're finally being reunited with your mother, and you act like this?
blade, give it up.

## who would ever guess you'd survive your mother's death?
but you did.

## nice, isn't it?
apparently, these geniuses forgot it ever existed.

## why are we here?
this temple was built for one glorious moment this night, for the blood god.

## acid etched?
i'il get used to a weapon like this.

## what?
you look surprised.

## why, man?
these are they're, like, all better.

## what do we have here?
the precious serum.

## is your blood on fire?
try some.

## it's a shame, you know?
when i think of what you've become, what you should have become.

## yeah, but he didn't turn, did he?
no.

## curtis?
ahh.

## karen?
karen.

## i've killed... and i've enjoyed it.
tell me, karen, do you ever have second thoughts about us?

## haven't you?
i know you have.

## the blood god?
that's nothing more than a fairy tale for pretty little vampires.

## then why are you sweating, pureblood?
you're afraid we're gonna steal your soul, your pureblood spirit.

## even if frost is right, you really think he cares about you?
you're gonna die, just like the rest of us.

## is everybody thirsty?
i hope you're all very fucking thirsty.

## you wouldn't hurt your mother... would you?
not anymore.

## what, your serum?
it was some guy from the community centre.

## are you gonna do it?
maybe next year, if things calm down at work a little.

## you want to rub some lotion on my back?
maybe later.

## successive approximations to the goal, remember?
god, that language just turns me on.

## excuse me, where did you get that?
this guy i work with at the museum.

## what about the kids?
they're sound asleep.

## hello?
oh, sure.

## do you want me to take a message?

## how could i possibly face her at work the next day?

## how do you feel about her?
she's nice, attractive, very sexy.

## but i'm not likely to make a deal and break it the way she did, am i?
close your eyes, sweetheart.

## feels good, doesn't it?
something that feels that good... can't be wrong.

## concussions are tricky, huh?
they can mess with your perceptions.

we thought you were dead.

## no one saw that?
i guess not.

## like baby jesus?
you're such a smart girl.

## do you love god, cody?
left him here to suffer.

## then how could someone actually recruit people to worship the devil?
only a secret inner circle practice traditional satanism.

## there, you see?
there's a spiritual battle going on in this world.

## what will eric do with her?
all these things will i give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.

## what do i do?
get her back whatever way you can.

## does she never leave?
they're taking her to the dentist tomorrow.

## you know why?
no.

## you never had a father before, did you?
no.

a werewolf's biorhythm... and how it's governed by the cycles of the moon.

oh, my god.

## hey, hey, what's up?
hey, man.

## huh?
that's impossible.

## are you sure you want to go through with this?
mm hmm.

## are you scared?
a little.

## and now, laertes, what's the news with you?
you told us of some suit.

## what wouldst thou beg, laertes?
my dread lord, my thoughts and wishes bend again toward france... and bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.

## what says polonius?
he hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave by laborsome petition... and at last upon his will...

## hamlet?
and now, my cousin hamlet, and my son.

## how is it that the clouds still hang on you?
not so, my lord, i am too much in the sun.

## so loving to my mother that he might not beteem the winds of heaven... visit her face too roughly.
if it be, why seems it so particular with thee?

## heaven and earth, must i remember?
why, she would hang on him... as if increase of appetite had grown by what it fed on.

## no more but so?
think it no more.

## tis in my memory locked, and you yourself shall keep the key of it.
yet here, laertes?

## what is it, ophelia, he hath said to you?
so please you, something touching the lord hamlet.

## do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
i do not know, my lord, what i should think.

## how fare you, sirs?
my lord.

## but what, in faith, make you from wittenberg?
a truant's disposition, good my lord.

## but what is your affair in elsinore?
my lord, i came to see your father's funeral.

## who?
my lord, the king your father.

## the king, my father?
season your admiration for a while with an attent ear... till i may deliver, upon the witness of these gentlemen, this marvel to you.

## but where was this?
upon the platform where we watch.

## did you not speak to it?
my lord, i did, but answer made it none.

## hold you the watch tonight?
we do, my lord.

## what, looked he frowningly?
a countenance more in sorrow than in anger.

## and fixed his eyes upon you?
ay, marry is it.

## what hour now?
it draws near the season wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.

## why, what should be the fear?
i do not set my life at a pin's fee.

## and for my soul, what can it do to that, being a thing immortal as itself?
think of it.

## murder?
murder most foul, as in the best it is.

## remember thee?
ay, thou poor ghost... whiles memory holds a seat in this distracted globe.

## remember thee?
yea, from the table of my memory...

## what news?
i think it sure that i have found the very cause of hamlet's lunacy.

## mad call i it... for, to define true madness, what is it but to be nothing else but mad?
but let that go.

## came this from hamlet to her?
good madam, stay awhile.

## what do you think of me?
as of a man faithful and honorable.

## hath there been such a time, i would fain know that... that i have positively said,\"'tis so,\"when it proved otherwise?
not that i know.

## how may we try it further?
you know, sometimes he walks four hours together here in the lobby.

## do you think 'tis this?
i doubt it is no other but the main.

## do you know me, my lord?
excellent well.

## honest, my lord?
to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man picked out of 10, 000.

## have you a daughter?
i have, my lord.

## what do you read, my lord?
words.

## between who?
the matter that you read.

## good my lord... how does your honor for this many a day?
i humbly thank you, well.

## what means your lordship?
that if you be honest and fair... your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty.

## could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?
at home, my lord.

## or to take arms against a sea of troubles... and by opposing end them?
to die...

## when he himself might his quietus make... with a bare bodkin?
and lose the name of action.

## prison, my lord?
denmark's a prison.

## shall we away?
for, by my fay, i cannot reason.

## what make you at elsinore?
to visit you, my lord.

## is it a free visitation?
come, come, deal justly with me.

## what should we say?
why, anything, but to the purpose.

## to what end?
that you must teach me.

## and yet, to me... what is this quintessence of dust?
man delights not me.

## when i said,\"man delights not me\"?
to think, if you delight not in man... what lenten entertainment the players shall receive.

## good my lord, will you see the players well bestowed?
for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time.

## use every man after his desert, and who shall escape whipping?
take them in.

## in what, my dear lord?
i am but mad north north west.

## for the law of writ and the liberty... these are the only men.
am i a coward?

## my lord, you played once for the university, you say?
that did i, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.

## what did you enact?
i did enact julius caesar.

## how fares our cousin hamlet?
excellent, in faith, of the chameleon's dish.

## lady, shall i lie in your lap?
no, my lord.

## i mean, my head upon your lap?
ay, my lord.

## do you think i meant country matters?
i think nothing, my lord.

## what is, my lord?
nothing.

## who, i?
ay, my lord.

## what should a man do but be merry?
for, look you, how cheerfully my mother looks... and my father died within's two hours.

## o heavens, die two months ago, and not forgotten yet?
there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half a year.

## why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners?
i am myself indifferent honest, but yet i could accuse me of such things... it were better my mother had not borne me.

## what should such fellows as i do crawling between earth and heaven?
believe none of us.

## is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
indeed, 'tis brief, my son.

## madam, how like you this play?
the lady doth protest too much, methinks.

## is there no offense in it?
no, they do but jest... poison in jest.

## what do you call the play?
the mousetrap.

## tis a knavish piece of work, but what of that?
your majesty and i have free souls, it touches us not.

## how fares my lord?
give me some...

## didst perceive?
very well.

## upon the talk of the poisoning?
i did very well...

## ay, sir, what of him?
is in his retirement marvelous distempered.

## with drink, sir?
no, my lord, rather with choler.

## what, my lord?
you do surely bar the door upon your own liberty... if you deny your griefs to your friend.

## will you play upon this pipe?
i cannot, my lord.

## god's blood, do you think i am easier to be played on than a pipe?
i will come to my mother by and by.

## now, mother, what's the matter?
hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.

## have you forgot me?
no, by the rood, not so.

## o me, what hast thou done?
nay, i know not.

## almost as bad, good mother... as kill a king and marry with his brother.
is it the king?

## as kill a king?
aye, lady, it was my word.

## what have i done, that thou darest wag thy tongue in noise so rude against me?
such an act that blurs the grace and blush of modesty... calls virtue hypocrite... makes marriage vows as false as dicers 'oaths.

## ay me, what act?
look here, upon this picture, and on this.

## have you eyes?
you cannot call it love... for at your age, the heyday in the blood is tame... it's humble, and waits upon the judgment.

## and what judgment would step from this to this?
eyes without feeling, feeling without sight.

## o shame, where is thy blush?
speak no more.

## what would your gracious figure?
alas, he's mad.

## do you not come your tardy son to chide?
oh, say.

## alas, how is it with you, that you do bend your eye on vacancy... and with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
o gentle son, say whereon do you look.

## do you see nothing there?
nothing at all.

## nor did you nothing hear?
no, nothing but ourselves.

## what shall i do?
where the dead body is bestowed, my lord, we could not get from him.

## now, hamlet... where's polonius?
at supper.

## where?
not where he eats, but where he is eaten.

## what dost thou mean by this?
nothing... but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar.

## where is polonius?
in heaven.

## for england?
ay, hamlet.

## you know that?
alas.

## so full of artless jealousy is guilt... it spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
how should i your true love know from another one?

## where is the beauteous majesty of denmark?
where is the...

## where is the king?
stay, my lord laertes.

## where is my father?
dead.

## o heavens, is it possible a young maid's wits... should be as mortal as an old man's life?
mine, sir.

## what man dost thou dig it for?
for no man, sir.

## what woman, then?
for none, neither.

## who is to be buried in it?
one that was a woman, sir.

## how long hast thou been grave maker?
since that very day that young hamlet was born.

## ay, marry, why was he sent into england?
why, because he was mad.

## why?
twill not be seen in him there.

## how long will a man lie in the earth ere he rot?
faith, if he be not rotten before he die, some eight year, nine year.

## whose was it?
a whoreson mad fellow's it was.

## whose do you think it was?
nay, i know not.

## this?
e'en that.

## quite chopfallen?
now get you to my lady's chamber... and tell her...

## who is this they follow?
lay her in the earth.

## i pray thee, good horatio, wait upon him.
what wilt thou do for her?

## will you be ruled by me?
i will, my lord, so you will not overrule me to a peace.

## but tell me, sir... why you proceeded not against these crimes so capital in nature?
the queen his mother lives almost by his looks.

## why ask you this?
not that i think you did not love your father.

## but, laertes... what would you undertake to show yourself your father's son... in deed more than in words?
to cut his throat in the church.

## shall i deliver you even so?
if his fitness speaks, mine is ready... now or whensoever, provided i be so able as now.

## cousin hamlet, you know the wager?
a touch, i do confess.

## they bleed on both sides.
say you so?

## here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned dane... drink of this potion.
how does my lord?

## heffron, finish me up.

## what does he need?

emily, we have bait.

## does he understand that?
honey, i can't help you if you don't talk to me.

## why doesn't he like elizabeth?

## what did you feel when you saw him?
i felt nothing.

## he wounded you deeply, didn't he?
no more than i wounded him.

## if they don't respect me, how can they ever love me?
then you must let the legions know... their treachery... will not go unpunished.

## what will you do?
this way.

## as you wept for your father?
i have been living in a prison of fear since that day.

## what does it matter if i trust you or not?
the gods have spared you.

## don't you understand?
today i saw a slave become more powerful than the emperor of rome.

## the gods have spared me?
i am at their mercy, with the power only to amuse the mob.

## do you not understand?
this man wants what you want.

## what's your name?
julian crassus.

## name?
marcus, sire.

## but a general is always in control, always in command, isn't he?
yes caesar.

## in germania?
you simply won't... die.

## are we so different, you and i?
your family, in the afterlife.

## what do you say to them?
to my boy...

## and did you note what happend?
nothing.

## why?
i have been told... of a certain sea snake... which has a very unusual method of attracting its prey.

## how long have the men been in ostia?
all winter.

## and how do they look?
fat and bored.

## who's in command?
some fool from rome.

## how soon could they be ready to fight?
for you, tomorrow.

## what are we to do?
i served your father at vindobona.

## the senate?
yes.

## to what end?
get me outside the city walls.

## you'il take your 5, 000 warriors and leave?
i will leave.

## so... once all of rome is yours, you'il just give it back to the people?
tell me why.

## who am i to trust?
i will kill commodus.

## why would i want that?
i sent for you.

## does gracchus have a new lover?
i don't know.

## life is.
do you remember what our father said once?

## do you think that's true?
i don't know.

## you have done all this?
yes.

## was i very different then?
you laughed more.

## isn't it late to be playing legionnaire?
i'm not a legionnaire.

## not a legionnaire?
i'm a gladiator.

## a gladiator?
gladiators only fight in the games.

## where's lucius?
he's with the emperor.

## it bit her in the breast?
yes.

## what do you think happened then, lucius?
i don't know, uncle.

## do you want to die, old man?
here.

## are you in danger of becoming a good man?
juba.

## or should i be merciful?
commodus the merciful.

## am i not merciful?
i'm a soldier, i obey.

## do you think i'm afraid?
i think you have been afraid all your life.

## unlike maximus the invincible, who knows no fear?
i knew a man who once said,\"death smiles at us all.

## did your friend smile at his own death?
you must know.

## that makes us brothers, doesn't it?
smile for me now, brother.

## is rome worth one good man's life?
we believed it once.

## who will help me carry him?
now we are free.

## still nothing?
not a sign.

## how long has he been gone?
nearly two hours.

## will they fight, sir?
we shall know soon enough.

## agreed?
they say no.

## would l?
he's been dying for ten years.

## for now, the first thing i shall do is have a hot bath.
and the senators?

## your highness?
we seem to be almost there, sir.

## where's the emperor?
he's at the front, sire.

## kiss?
you have proved your valor yet again, maximus.

## how can i reward rome's greatest general?
let me go home.

## have i missed the battle?
you have missed the war.

## still alive?
still alive.

## or to rome?
home.

## well, why not?
rome was founded as a republic.

## emperor or senate?
a soldier has the advantage of being able... to look his enemy in the eye, senator.

## how may i be of service, highness?
you're a man who knows what it is to command.

## can i count on you when the time comes?
highness, when your father releases me, i intend to return home.

## home?
well, no one's earned it more.

## did you know?
she's not forgotten you.

## i wonder, would you have been just?
i would have been what you taught me to be.

## how was your journey?
long.

## why have i come?
i need your help.

## this is a pleasant fiction, isn't it?
tell me again, maximus.

## why are we here?
for the glory of the empire, sire.

## do you see that map, maximus?
that is the world which i created.

## and for what?
i brought the sword.

## and what would you believe?
they fought for you and for rome.

## and what is rome?
i've seen much of the rest of the world.

## or will i be the emperor who gave rome back her true self?
there was once a dream that was rome.

## remember the last time you were home?
two years, 264 days and this morning.

## what would you have me do, caesar?
i want you to become the protector of rome after i die.

## will you accept this great honor that i have offered you?
with all my heart, no.

## and commodus?
commodus is not a moral man.

## what did my father want with you?
to wish me well before i leave for home.

## or do you think me heartless?
i think you have a talent for survival.

## is it really so terrible seeing me again?
no.

## will you serve my brother as you served his father?
i will always serve rome.

## you don't find it hard to do your duty?
sometimes i do what i want to do.

## are you ready to do your duty for rome?
yes, father.

## which wiser, older man is to take my place?
my powers will pass to maximus... to hold in trust... until the senate is ready to rule once more.

## my decision disappoints you?
you wrote to me once...

## what is it in me you hate so much?
all i've ever wanted... was to live up to you, caesar.

## how did he die?
the surgeons say there was no pain.

## prudent?
the emperor has been slain.

## remember the last time you were home?
two years, 264 days and this morning.

## better now?
clean.

## i do special price for you.
you see?

## have you seen my new stock?
come and see them.

## do any of them fight?
i've got a match coming up.

## what's your trade?
i was a hunter.

## but who cares?
he's a spaniard.

## one thousand?
i am proximo.

## why don't you fight?
we all have to fight.

## will that not anger them?
the gods favor you.

## but what has he conquered?
give him time, gracchus.

## for rome, or for you?
my father spent all his time at study... at books of learning and philosophy.

## have you ever embraced someone dying of plague, sire?
no, but if you interrupt me again...

## who are they to lecture me?
commodus, the senate has its uses.

## what uses?
traditions.

## why?
they didn't see the battles.

## what do they care about germania?
they care about the greatness of rome.

## well, what is that?
it's an idea greatness.

## do you not see, lucilla?
i will give the people a vision of rome, and they will love me for it.

## you really think the people are going to be seduced by that?
i think he knows what rome is.

## boy?
you sent for me.

## you were a gladiator?
yes, i was.

## you won your freedom?
a long time ago, the emperor... presented me with a rudis.

## you knew marcus aurelius?
i did not say i knew him.

## will i ever see them again?
i think no.

## do you believe you'il see them again when you die?
i think so.

## but you would wait?
of course.

## have you ever seen anything like that before?
i didn't know men could build such things.

## are the people ready?
i think you need your rest now.

## still afraid of the dark, brother?
still.

## why don't you go down to the prison, round up all the beggars and thieves?
we've done that.

## you don't like it?
yes.

## a man's?
no.

## they have good horses in spain?
some of the best.

## they let you watch the games?
my uncle says it makes me strong.

## and what does your father say?
my father is dead.

## your name is lucius?
yes.

## do you understand?
yes, sire.

## who is he?
they call him the spaniard, sire.

## you do have a name?
my name is gladiator.

## why is he still alive?
i don't know.

## what did you feel when you saw him?

how you make love.

well, in the calculus of personal injury law, a dead child is worth the least of all.

## how you doing?
good.

## do me a favor, will you?
shut the fuck up.

## open?
here we go.

## would you like some water?
carney versus massachusetts general hospital case number 812725.

## why does their pain become my pain?
i wish i could find some way not to empathize.

## how are you?
very well.

## how are you?
sounds pretty.

## how come you never call me?
believe me, if i had your number, i would call you.

## is this ricky?
no.

## we are?
uh huh.

## i'm sorry, what was your name?
anne...

## why don't you come up to woburn one of these days and actually meet a few of those people whose pain is your pain...... jan?
let me try and picture how this happened.

## is that unusual?
apparently, statistically.

## this woman lost a child?
they think it has something to do with the city's drinking water which they say has always tasted funny.

## what was she like before?
i'd like to know that.

## to prove something like this, you need new medical research.
do want to hear what it's about?

## and... and you have to ask yourself, why is this an orphan?
why has it been kicked from firm to firm before it ended up on your desk.

## from who?
from whoever did this.

## but who is that?
well, we don't know.

## who is going to apologize to you and pay me?
there has to be a defendant and one with very deep pockets.

## a tannery?
and some other small factories.

## what would that... what would that accomplish?
i do hope you find someone.

## and the other one?
w. r. grace.

## what's this?
that's the ticket.

## when did he ask me?
yeah.

## on your lunch break?
that hardly seems fair.

## how you doing?
well, all right, i guess, under the circumstances.

## what circumstances are those?
woburn... these outrageous charges.

## who?
we're co defendants in a lawsuit, mr facher, a very serious lawsuit.

## what is that thumping?
yeah, well, it's gone now.

## what's on your mind?
well, i'il tell you what i'm thinking.

## with what?
mr...

## cheeseman, is it?
mr cheeseman.

## when you get a fine what do you do?
you pay it and go back to business.

## what are you looking for with this suit?
well, obviously, we'il be seeking compensation for the families and punitive damages for the willful negligence of these two companies.

## but is that what this is really all about... money?
no.

## is that what matters most to any of us?
no.

## what does that have to do with anything?
it clouds his judgement, and that's as beneficial to his client as a doctor who recoils at the sight of blood.

## is this the only case?
this is a lot of lawyers.

## you have some interest in this case?
i'm a co defendant, so i guess i do have an interest, but it's not my motion.

## and that motion is?
your honor, if i might.

## really?
yes.

## mr schlichtmann, you are a personal injury lawyer, are you not?
i think you'il survive that.

## you see?
it's starting already.

## do you think i might at least hear this motion before you explain to me what it's really about?
of course.

## your motion to dismiss is based on?
rule 11, your honor.

## do you know what rule 11 is, mr schlichtmann?
well, to be honest with you, your honor, i had to look it up.

## so did i. do you know why, mr cheeseman?
because it is so old and ambiguous few lawyers waste their time with it, or mine.

## anything else?
no, your honor.

## and you're talking about you and a couple of assistants, or something?
no.

## a team?
a big team.

## used solvent?
yeah.

## and, er, what would you do with those drums when they were filled up?
don't know.

## they were just gone?
never noticed.

## you never dumped them out back?
no.

## never noticed anyone who did?
no.

## what were your duties at grace back then, mr shalline?
oversee disposal and discharge to the drains.

## you never heard anything about this?
no.

## back then in 1965 or thereafter did you clean metal parts with any type of solvent?
yes.

## what kind?
that i couldn't tell you.

## did you ever notice the name trichlorethylene or tce?
no, i don't know.

## but you'd put it in barrels when you were done with it, that seems to be the process, right?
yes.

## did you ever see what happened to these barrels of solvent when you were through with them?
yes.

## what was that?
they get dumped.

## where?
out back, in the ground.

## you saw this?
yes.

## when?
my coffee break.

## do you need a break?
no.

## what do you mean?
the names of people.

## mr love, do you have any children?
yes, i do.

## that's quite a family.
eight?

## now?
it's all right.

## what about then, 10, 15 years ago?
it had an odor then.

## did you drink it?
yeah, i drank it.

## the kids?
yes.

## were you concerned when you found out that the wells were contaminated?
i'm going to object to that.

## for your family's health?
yes.

## has any member of your family had any illness out of the ordinary?
you don't have to answer any of these type of questions.

## what kind?
one of my sons has a seizure disorder, my eldest daughter has had two miscarriages and my youngest boy was born with...

## are we going to sit here all day and go through his entire family's medical history?
yes, i am.

## how do you know?
i just do.

## look, if i took a hundred pennies and threw them up in the air, about half of them would land heads and the other half tails, right?
now, if i looked around closely, i'd probably find some heads grouped together in a cluster.

## does that mean anything?
you see, no one knows what causes leukemia, al.

## do you eat peanut butter?
no.

## you've never eaten peanut butter?
i guess everyone alive has probably tried it, but i'm not exactly what you'd call a peanut butter fan.

## do you eat bacon?
yes.

## do you have silver fillings in your teeth?
so, you were aware when you moved to woburn that its water didn't taste good.

## did you ever consider using bottled water?
we used bottled water off and on, split half and half.

## has any doctor ever told you that you had any dysfunction of your immune system?
no.

## why did you have an autopsy?
because he was doing good.

## did you talk to the doctor about this?
i had more like a violent talk with him.

## you were angry?
yelling at him.

## he was in remission?
you were optimistic about his future and suddenly he became ill and died.

## you try to explain on the phone and they say,\"has he got a temperature?
you say,\"no.\"\"he's all right, then,\"they say.

## he was in the clinic when he died?
no.

## he died in the car on the way to the clinic?
he died on i 93, up by the somerville exit.

## there's seven?
yes.

## what the fuck is this?
no, no, you keep that.

## these two chemicals mixed together are used to waterproof leather, are they not?
i asked you a question, mr riley... again.

## what exactly do you intend to say to me, mr riley, by pouring water on my table?
this is how silicone is put on leather to waterproof it.

## did i say tce?
i didn't say tce.

## your invoices, purchase orders and formulas?
no.

## so you want me to go back out there?
this is the case against beatrice, this liar.

## you got the rest of the medical records?
almost.

## you want to just get out now and throw away 900 and... what is it?
1. 4 million dollars.

## how much of it?
all of it.

## what about the carney settlement?
how much of that is...

## on?
woburn.

## two, three hundred?
600, 000.

i don't think so.

## bobby?
he might.

## could you call him?
yeah, that's the stuff got dumped.

## out there in the gully there, you know?
dumped it back there in the gully right there.

## tommy?
no, not tommy, no.

## never did anything like that?
no, no.

## is that how you remember it now that your memory's been refreshed?
that's what we called it... the swimming pool.

## so why does anyone do it?
business is good.

## is it?
that's good.

## are you sure?
you don't have to worry, jerry.

## you know what?
you don't want me in this case.

## you're offering to cover my expenses?
your expenses and your pride.

## do you really think i'd let that happen?
i don't see how you can prevent it.

## jan, guess what?
cheeseman called.

## are the red sox in town?
sorry i'm late.

## which chair?
it's black with arms, with my name on a brass plate on the back.

## jerry, ever thought about getting yourself a new briefcase?
no, no.

## am i sitting in the right place?
well, actually, we have a seat for you here, but that's fine.

## really?
this is a good quality pen.

## how much did grace make last year?
i have no idea.

## what?
436 million dollars.

## to compensate the families, to provide for their economic security in the future?
don't forget to mention you compensating you.

## can i ask a question?
i'm sure everyone has questions.

## can i have this?
thank you.

## what's the story?
well i guess they just don't want to end this thing.

## yeah?
we can't afford a long drawn out trial.

## am i the financial advisor around here?
no, you're not.

## why?
to evaporate.

## did they?
yes.

## who needs them?
and call the janitorial people, tell them their services are no longer required.

## how much can i send you right now?
nothing.

## if you should fall asleep at the council table, the first thing you say when you wake up should be...
you got a winner there?

## eh...?
objection.

## do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
yes.

## would you care for a glass of water?
no, thank you.

## are you sure?
now the single greatest liability a lawyer can have is pride.

## mr riley, you own the property referred to often in this courtroom as the 15 acres, do you not?
no, i don't.

## some kind of conservation group?
yes, sir.

## now you have no idea how it got that way?
no, sir.

## does it upset you to learn this?
very much so.

## why?
and one last thing, unless you know exactly what the answer's going to be, never, ever ask a witness\"why\".

## this?
no.

## you're just noticing now?
gordon laid everybody off two weeks ago.

## gordon, instead of sitting there reading a magazine, why don't you go to uncle pete and get me a staff?
that's a good idea.

## hello?
yes, i was told there was a cheeseman on the mayflower.

## you've been talking without my being present?
no, we have been drinking coffee without your being present.

## jerry?
last night, i was at a ball game.

## chemicals?
poisons.

## what?
i think i'd have to agree with that.

## what don't you understand?
they're straightforward questions.

## from out of a hat?
question two.

## well how can they determine that?
science can't even determine when the chemicals arrived at the wells with the precision that you're asking of the jurors.

## but what does that mean?
it's like english translated into japanese back into english again.

## for who?
for me, of course.

## you think?
well, here's my take.

## what's your take?
they'il see the truth.

## the truth?
i thought we were talking about a court of law.

## well, since when?
eight kids are dead, jerry.

## that's not how you made all that money all these years, is it?
you want to know when this case stopped being about dead children? the minute you filed the complaint.

## why don't we test your born again faith in the righteousness of our courts with a high stakes gamble?
if that's a settlement offer, jerry, it's not enough.

## who said that?
the irs, telling us they have a lien on any eventual settlement in order to recover over two and a half million dollars in unpaid taxes.

## what if i would add six zeros onto that?
that's right.

## let's get the decision makers together and talk seriously.
now, that would put things in perspective for you, wouldn't it?

## the decision makers are here, aren't they?
you're looking at mr beatrice.

## do you?
it's just you and me.

## mr foreman, members of the jury, have you reached a verdict?
yes, your honor.

## disappointed?
no, no.

## right now?
i think we should celebrate, have some champagne.

## so you intend to go forward with your claims against grace, no matter how long it takes?
we have to get out of this case as fast as we can.

## why not?
farmers 'bank of iowa.

## how are you?
sorry i'm late.

## you got lost?
yes.

## how did you manage that?
i've never been here before so...

## never been here before, what kind of harvard man are you?
the cornell kind.

## damn good.
cornell?

## so what do you want?
well, i could take you through it step by step or, if you prefer, you could take this with you and study it.

## i meant, what do you want to drink?
i wanted to reach across and strangle him with his tie.

## you sail?
no.

## you don't sail?
finally, we went to his office.

## he said 8 million?
i can't go to them empty handed.

## i owe them more than that.
what are you talking about?

## it isn't worth it, jan.
you owe them?

## nobody calls any more?
not even the creditors.

## are the phones still working?
schlichtmann, conway and crowley.

## do i look like i'm here?
he's in a meeting at the moment.

## do me a favor, gordon, will you?
shut up.

## what?
i'm so tired of hearing you moan about money all the time.

## what's it about, jan?
yes.

## but you won't take eight?
no.

## what do i have?
i got a couple of bucks and some bus transfers.

## and they're gonna clean the place up?
no.

## would you call this an apology?
no.

## how can you even begin to compare what you've lost to what we've lost?
listen, the minute you put money on the table, things turn ugly.

## they've had it, they want out, right?
it's time they went their separate way.

## you know what i think of that?
fine.

## so what if we have to start over?
we did it once.

## and what did you do?
you let him in the door.

## mr granger?
i don't have to talk to you.

## did he tell you why?
yes, he did.

## lighting fire crackers, drinking beers?
i've nothing to say to you.

## did riley threaten you in any way, with what might happen to you if you ever came forward?
no, sir.

## he didn't say anything at all to you in this regard?
he gave me a couple of celtics tickets.

## mr facher?
sorry.

## mr schlichtmann?
i'm sorry.

## yes?
the purpose of these questions is not to embarrass or humiliate you, but rather to verify the information you've declared as your assets.

## that after 17 years of practicing law, all you have to show for it is... 14 dollars in a chequing account and a portable radio?
that's correct.

## the money?
the money, the property, the personal belongings.

## where are you hurt?
you must be one of the scavengers who search soldiers corpses for valuables.

## what is?
hiding them here.

## afraid they will come looking for defeated soldiers?
we will worry about it when the time comes.

## why?
you didn't get hurt.

## otsu san...
who got me into this...?

## do you dream of matahachi?
yes, many times.

## how will we face them?
i'il apologize to granny and to otsu.

## what are you doing?
the coming winter.

## winter?
it's depressing.

## akemi chan, why do you and your mother live so dangerously?
we can't make a living by selling moxa only.

## so, akemi chan is one of them?
i'm just a child of the wilderness.

## akemi chan.
hey, you know what?

## why do you have that bell on your sleeve?
i don't know.

## don't know?
funny, you have it on.

## doesn't it sound beautiful?
i sewed these for you.

## where are you going, takeyan?
never mind.

## never mind?
you're acting so strange.

## go home?
right now.

## without telling the family?
i think it's best.

## okay?
but...

## getting ready for the festival tomorrow?
yes.

## what are you doing there?
we are celebrating buddha's birth tomorrow.

## to who?
your son, matahachi.

## i'm wondering where he's hiding?
we've yet to find any trace of him.

## otsu, did you hear that?
i don't know.

## what?
yes, that's right.

## i see.
are you a shinmen?

## then, you're the famous hon'iden granny?
i heard matahachi died at sekigahara.

## which one is takezo's sister?
don't be rude as i'm a woman living alone.

## the bath?
it's this way.

## you're...?
granny, i came to see you.

## what happened to matahachi?
granny, matahachi is alive.

## where are you going now?
first, i plan to... see my sister and then i intend to leave miyamoto village.

## aren't you hungry?
haven't eaten for days.

## how's the water temperature?
i don't know.

## uh, otsu san?
you look pale.

## this is fortunate for you.
for me?

## if you became his wife... and he sent this letter, what would you do then?
if i were you, i would be happy.

## otsu, are you in?
there you are.

## okay?
please go.

## come sit here and relax.
okay?

## are you angry?
it's been twenty days and you still can't capture takezo.

## you will?
how interesting.

## you're his retainer, but you haven't heard?
terumasa and i are very good friends.

## you think i'm kidding?
no, but...

## but what?
including officers, footsoldiers and farmers...

## you can't?
about takezo's treatment after i capture him...

## you can't?
very well.

## what will you do?
i will hang myself on the 1, 000 year old cedar.

## hang yourself?
otsu san...

## they placed these here to trap takezo san, didn't they?
yes.

## why do the villagers despise takezo so much?
some force must make them that way.

## is it inside a man's heart?
but takezo is also at fault.

## leaving a man like takezo on the loose... means lives may be lost daily.
takuan san, do you also hate takezo san?

## would you not agree, otsu san?
i wish to know why he chose to return here... despite all the danger.

## also, what kind of woman matahachi is with?
i want to hear that from takezo san.

## what are you looking at?
he should be appearing soon.

## you mean takezo san?
yes.

## who would come to get captured?
no, no...

## what is it?
today is the third day...

## then, why don't you go looking for him?
i wouldn't be able to find him... not in these hills.

## my flute?
any tune will do.

## can't you tell, otsu san?
look, takezo is there.

## why are you here?
actually, we're here to capture you.

## you came knowing that?
very well.

## huh?
there is the law of the clan.

## win what?
i mean win over yourself.

## now, i have to ask you for advice.
how will you face your ancestors?

## but i will take custody of takezo.
what?

## mustache man... you intend to break your promise as a samurai?
no sense in letting a captured man free.

## you must be kidding?
priests tend to funerals.

## sir, a messenger is here.
why don't we hang takezo from this tree and expose him to the wind and and the rain... and let the crows feed on his eyes?

## what is it?
aoki dono, it's a message from the lord.

## otsu, are you one of them?
otsu... you must be tired.

## you're sure?
yes.

## why don't you leave the temple... and move to the hon'iden residence?
well...

## you want me?
who else will marry matahachi.

## i don't have to leave the temple as of yet?
you can't do two jobs at once.

## understood?
this is an order.

## aoki dono?
hello, otsu dono.

## understand?
i'il give you this letter.

## was that your only mistake?
it's more like everything was a mistake.

## no, you may not have enough time?
oh, granny.

## wasn't that a terrible storm last night?
but such a good storm.

## why didn't you use your strength and youth more constructively?
i'il come up to save you.

## you're saving me?
yes, i will.

## where are we?
the top of mount nagayama.

## priest takuan and otsu are gone.
you will let me go?

## takezo... about your sister ogin...
what?

## is my sister safe?
that's right.

## to my sister?
never mind where.

## you'il let me see her?
yes, there is someone i would like you to meet.

## then, will you allow me to handle him?
granted.

## how will you handle him?
i heard that ghosts dwell within the attic of this castle.

## you mean the same blood that flows through my body?
that's right.

## alright, takezo?
over there, you will find the writings of japanese and chinese scholars.

## how is your condition?
much better.

## see anything else?
no, nothing.

## what will i find?
before today, my courage...

## please?
you came to the right place, my friend.

## it's snowing.

## ten years old, huh?

## so one could take the train?
just hypothetically.

## what would connecticut have to offer us?
lyme disease.

## you ever thought there might be more to life than steak, alex?
he didn't mean that, baby.

## doesn't it bother you guys that you don't know anything about life outside this zoo?

## what's eating him?
maybe you should talk to him.

## i mean, i tell you, itjust doesn't get any better than this, you know?

## this doesn't make any sense.
marty?

## hello?

## now, where's the train?

## what did marty say to you?
i asked you to talk to him.

## i said,\"are you crazy?
he says,\"i'm ten years old.

## did you say\"zebra\"?
that's right.

## can i shoot it?
negative.

## did that say\"grand central station\"or\"my aunt's constipation\"?
this is it.

## what are you guys doing here?
i am so glad we found you.

## you're fine?
oh, he's fine.

## you hear that?
marty's fine.

## what's the big deal?
i was coming back.

## do you hear him?

## okay?
everything's cool.

## would you give a guy a break?
we'il take my little friend home and forget this ever happened.

## no harm, no foul, right?
hey, it's cool.

## what's the matter with them?
i feel really, really weird.

## oh, my head.

## i am loving the sound of your voice.
alex, marty, is that you?

## what is going on?
yeah.

## cat scan?
i fail to see how this is my fault.

## you're kidding, right, marty?

## i did not ask you to come after me, did i?
he does have a point.

## does anybody feel nauseous?
i feel nauseous.

## can you read?
that ain't going to fly.

## guys?
oh, no.

## somebody.

## is that you?
melman, i got you.

## what are you doing?
i'm getting you out of the box.

## yeah, here we are.

## where exactly is\"here\"?

## san diego?
white sandy beaches, cleverly simulated natural environment, wide open enclosures.

## what could be worse than san diego?
okay, i'm...

## don't you hear that?

## is that the best you can do?
i just saw 26 blatant health code violations.

## what happened to him?
he was right behind us.

## wasn't he?
he scared the fossa away.

## do not be near the king's feet, okay?
we're hiding.

## who's making that noise?
oh, it's me again.

## is it still on me?
i hate spiders.

## didn't i tell him about the feet?
he did tell you about the feet.

## really?
i have devised a cunning test to see whether these are savage killers.

## oh, alex, what'd you do?
stop.

## he's a big, bad old puddy tat, isn't he?
come on.

## what is he, like, king of the guinea pigs?
i think it's a squirrel.

## why'd you tell your wish?
you're not supposed to.

## remember?

## how long do i have to pose like this?

that's wild fire.

## can we go to the fun side now?
everybody, calm down.

## separate those two, would you, please?
you here, you there.

## calm down, people, okay?
now, presenting your royal highness, the illustrious blah, blah, blah.

## yes, willie?
i like them.

## i mean, does anyone wonder why the fossa were so scared of mr. alex?
i mean, maybe we should be scared too.

## what if mr. alex is even worse than the fossa?
i tell you, that dude just gives me the heebiedabajeebies.

## no?
good.

## now, who would like a cookie?
yo, al.

## could you just give it a chance?

## who built a forest?
don't be alarmed, giant freaks.

## what?
no, not whooha.

## how about once around the park?
let's get our blood pumping, lungs breathing this fresh air.

## now, who's the cat?
marty, i really don't...

## who's the cat?
you the cat.

## who's the cat?
you the cat.

## crackalacking.
who's the cat?

## ain't that right, melman?
oh, yeah.

## king?
i've got a crown.

## have i got it on?

## i didn't.

nothing personal.

## in light of what's happened...... perhaps playing the dead pool game isn't smart.
can we ask you a few questions?

## any tie between the dead pool and squares 'death?
none whatsoever.

## mr. swan, will the game continue?
no, we're filming a nightmare sequence at the shipyards...... and we'd like to forget this and get on with our job.

## is he the one?
the typewriter used on these letters...... is the same one used to tip us off to the dead pool.
