## as an indian woman, how could you accept the indignity of prison?
my dignity comes from following my husband.

## may i?
i'm glad to be home...

## who's that young man?
that's young nehru.

## are you involved too, mrs. nehru?
no.

## how do you do?
and mr. prakash, who, i fear...... is awaiting trial for sedition and inducement to murder.

## may i, mohan?
i'm going nearer to god.

## you see?
it is most comfortable.

## are you a christian?
yes, i'm a christian.

## what the devil's happened to him?
he's discovering india.

## have you read his magazine?
no.

## why should the british grant us home rule?
we must take the peelings to the goats.

## the question is, do you fight to change things or to punish?
i've found we're all such sinners, we should leave punishment to god.

## what the hell is going on?
i don't know, sir.

## on what charge?
i don't want any trouble.

## the landlords are british?
what we can do, we will try to do.

## shukla...... is all champaran like this?
yes, bapu.

## are you mr. m. k. gandhi?
yes.

## then it will be prison.
who did you say would be buying the drinks?

## did they take your clothes?
these are my clothes now.

## couldn't i be let in with the prisoner?
i am a clergyman.

## what do you want me to do?
i think that you can help us most...... by taking that assignment you've been offered in fiji.

## how did the press get here before the military?
that english clergyman sent a number of telegrams yesterday.

## do you want to go to jail?
as you wish.

## and a commission, part indian, to hear grievances.
what do they want?

## that would satisfy him?
and his majesty's government.

## where is mr. gandhi?
he said he preferred to walk, sir.

## are they men that we'd want at the head of our country?
i too have read mr. gandhi's writings...... but i'd rather be ruled by an indian terrorist than an english one.

## may i?
i want to embarrass all those who wish to treat us as slaves.

## and what resistance would you offer?
the law is due to take effect from april 6.

## a general strike?
even the english newspapers would have to report that...... and explain why.

## why not?
champaran stirred the whole country.

## don't you think so, your highness?
of course, the army will always be ioyal.

## is it simply delhi and bombay?
karachi, calcutta, madras, bangalore.

## you too?

this sucks balls, man.

## like how?

## even sheep?
of course.

## they are beautiful, aren't they?
oh, god, yes.

## what is your damage, little boy?
you got a sick and twisted world perspective.

## i mean, if you were another sheep... would you fuck a sheep if you were another sheep?

## why don't you do that?
fuck you, fatty.

## uh, you guys want anything from inside?
no, we're cool.

## no?
ok.

## just isn't the same, is it?
this place licks balls compared to the quick stop.

## he was our patsy, remember?
we'll just find someone else.

## jay?
no, he's not.

## what am i, blind?
he wasn't kissing your hand in the back of the van...

## the female clitoris?
uh, yeah.

## think i can get a little blow job for good luck?
no.

## they in?
you could say that.

## you got that?
there ain't no snacks here, man.

## you mind if i leave that... there?
is that...

## who let the cats out, huh?
wait.

## who the hell are you?
federal wildlife marshal.

## what is what is it what is it?
a tape of the terrorists who claim responsibility... for the break in.

## do you have a vcr?
i am the clit commander.

## why?
because we may very well be dealing... with the two most dangerous men on the planet.

## is that thing waving at us?
holy shit, it understood us.

## what if there's more super monkeys up at that lab?
holy shit!

## did you see that shit, man?
bitches love me.

## at this point, what can you tell us about the c. l. i. t.?
from the intelligence we've been gathering... we've discovered that the c. l. i. t... is actually a tiny offshoot of the l. a. b. i. a.

## uh, the liberate apes before imprisoning apes movement?
exactly.

## see?
told you that restraining order was a good idea.

## what response do you hope to elicit... by putting this kind of pressure on the c. l. i. t.?
it s a difficult situation.

## is that your cell phone, sir?
plaschke.

## don't you have any regret?
jay and bob don't deserve this.

## you the gals that ordered the pizza?
this dopey bitch ordered a large plain... but i could go for some hot thick sicilian.

## now ain't you glad we came here to eat?
and you were all piss scared... we'd get busted by the cops or something.

## think they're talking about us?
sorry.

## who the hell are you?
federal wildlife marshal.

## is the monkey in there?
the ape.

## what?
orangutan's a member of the great ape family.

## me or you?
that's what i thought.

## what the fuck are you waiting for?
get out there and give him the monkey.

## their son?
maybe they're one of those gay couples.

## i think i would recognize an ape if i saw one, ok?
ahh.

## man, who the fuck just steals a monkey?
oh, yeah.

## how the fuck do we know where that car's going?

## hey, lemme ask you a question.

## jules?
in a posting pulled off of moviepoopshoot. com... the gruesome twosome threatened, and i quote...

## but no sign of jay and silent bob?
none whatsoever... what jay and silent bob even look like... so for all we know, they could already be on the lot.

## have you seen them roaming around?
no, steve, but...

## contrary to what you believe... not everyone in the industry is a homosexual.
where do you think you're going?

## how about this deal?

## am i first?
um, i don't know.

## well, just just give me an address or something, okay?
tell you what, go up three more streets, take a right, go two more blocks, drop this guy off on the next corner.

## where's that?
i don't know either, but it's somewhere, and it's gonna determine the course of the rest of your life.

## but how do i know they understand?
because words are inert.

## they're dead, you know?
and so much of our experience is intangible.

## until what?
until you reach a crescendo in a way... could be imagined as an enormous instantaneous fulfillment of human, human and neo human potential.

## it's efficient, okay?
and its manifestations are those social adaptations.

## you're talking about parasitism, dominance, morality, okay?
uh, war, predation, these would be subject to de emphasis.

## hey, you got a match?
and they haven't given us any other options... outside the occasional, purely symbolic, participatory act of voting.

## i keep thinking about something you said.
you want the puppet on the right or the puppet on the left?

## something i said?
yeah.

## you remember that?
yeah.

## you know what i'm saying?
oh, yeah, definitely.

## then what would you be in all that?
whatever i am right now.

## what's that?
just about reincarnation and where all the new souls come from over time.

## the world population has doubled in the past 40 years, right?
so if you really believe in that ego thing of one eternal soul, mm hmm. then you only have a 50  chance of your soul being over 40.

## reincarnation doesn't exist... or that we're all young souls like where half of us are first round humans?
no, no.

## you know the best part?
you'll see me bring that cigar closer and closer... to your wide open eyeball... till you're almost out of your mind.

## what about quantum mechanics?
i know enough contemporary physical theory to know it's not really like that.

## should our freedom just be a matter of probabilities, just some random swerving in a chaotic system?
resistance is not futile.

## you know that thing benedict anderson says about identity?
no.

## why is world history and evolution not stories of progress... but rather this endless and futile addition of zeroes?
no greater values have developed.

## what are you writing?
a novel.

## what's the story?
there's no story.

## are you in the story?
i don't think so.

## why don t you pull the trigger and find out?
they say that dreams are real only as long as they last.

## can't you say the same thing about life?
a lot of us out there are mapping that mind/ body relationship of dreams.

## did you ever have a job that you hated and worked real hard at?
a long, hard day of work.

## hey, man, what are you doing here?
i fancy myself the social lubricator of the dream world, helping people become lucid a little easier.

## by becoming lucid, you mean just knowing that you re dreaming, right?
yeah.

## so what was going on in your dream?
oh.

## i woke up wondering, where did all this stuff come from?
you can control that.

## do you have these dreams all the time?
hell, yeah.

## but that's one of the things you do to test if you re dreaming or not, right?
yeah, like i said, you can totally train yourself to recognize it.

## what's that?
oh, man, it's way ambitious, but i'm getting better at it.

## pretty cool, huh?
yeah.

## what's that mean?
well, you know, i never figured it out.

## of a specific height who looks a certain way, right?
mm hmm.

## you want me to get it for you?
you got it.

## i got it?
but it's ridiculous.

## well, you'd be in the moment.
but who can live that way?

## the moment is holy, right?
yeah, but i'd be open.

## why would you cry?
for me, i just tend to cry.

## everything is layers, isn't it?
yeah.

## hey, old man, what you doing up there?
i'm not sure.

## you need any help getting down, sir?
no, i don't think so.

## why so glum, mr. deborg?
what was missing was felt irretrievable.

## you a dreamer?
yeah.

## could we do that again?
i know we haven't met, but i don't want to be an ant.

## you know?
stop.

## you want ketchup with that?
i don't want a straw.

## i don't want to be an ant, you know?
yeah.

## so, you wanna do it?
uh, yeah.

## i don't really know how to say it, but, um uh, what's it like to be a character in a dream?
and i haven't even worn a watch since, like, fourth grade.

## what are you doing?
i i you know, i can't really remember right now.

## what is your consistent perspective?
i'm not in an objective, rational world.

## like, right now i know that i'm dreaming, right?
we're, like, even talking about it.

## well, how do you feel?
well, sometimes i feel kind of isolated, but most of the time, i feel really connected, really, like, engaged in this active process.

## do you remember me?
no.

## at the station?
you were on the pay phone and you looked at me... a few times.

## are you sure?
well, maybe not.

## so doesn't it make sense that death, too, would be wrapped in dream?
it would be the same dream body you experience in your everyday dream life.

## a what?
you gave me a ride in a car that was also a boat.

## i remember and ferment the desire to remember everything.
you know that cat that was just in here, who just ran out the door?

## and i'm tired of cleaning up your little burrito doings.
so, what did you say to that?

## you dig me?
they're like little wheels.

## weren t you in the boat car?
you know, the guy the guy with the hat.

## but it sounds like what else are you gonna do, right?
anyway, i read this essay by philip k..

## what, you read it in your dream?
no, no.

## you know that one?
yeah, yeah.

## so that's really freaking him out, but what can he do?
and shortly after that, he was going to mail a letter, and he saw this kind of, um, dangerous, shady looking guy standing by his car.

## so this whole episode is kind of creepy, right?
and he's telling his priest about it, describing how he wrote this book, and four years later, all these things happened to him.

## it's no more 50 a. d. than it's 2001, you know?
there's just this one instant, and that's what we're always in.

## how did you finally get out of it?
oh, man.

## yeah, but how did you finally get out of the dream?
see, that's my problem.

## how do you really wake up?
i don't know.

## we could drive by to take you in the morning?
ok.

## see you tomorrow?

right side... with intensity.

## is that everything?
it seemed like he said quite a bit more than that.

## how's tokyo?
it is great here.

## rather one has to let them be themselves, don't you think?
yeah.

## do you think that this is done?
i don't know.

the other governors and i desided |it's time for you to step aside.

## spiders flee before it it all fits but how's basilisk been getting around?
a dirty great snake...

## moaning myrtle?
all students to return to their house dormitories at once.

## how did you escape with nothing but a scar while lord voldemort's powers were destroyed?
why do you care how i escaped? |voldemort was after your time......

## how can i speak a language without knowing i can?
i don't know, but it sounded like you were egging the snake on or something.

## bee in your bonnet, potter?
i was just wondering if you put me in the right house.

## harry?
professor.

## you don't think it was me, professor?
no, harry.

it s been 50 years since the chamber was opened.

## what's the matter with you two?
that was close.

## do you remember me telling you...... that the polyjuice potion was only for human transformations?

## shall we?
fudge.

## well?
lf....

## what?
you heard what hagrid said.

## why spiders?
come on.

## who is it?
don't panic.

## is that you?
we're friends of hagrid's.

## you're aragog, aren't you?

## then you're not the monster?
no.

## but if you're not the monster, then what did kill that girl 50 years ago?
we do not speak of it.

## but have you seen it?
well, thank you.

## go?
i think not.

## know any spells?
one, but it's not powerful enough for all of them.

## lf hagrid ever gets out of azkaban, i il kill him.
where's hermione when you need her?

## what have we found out?
we know one thing.

## what's that?
ron....

## but if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it no one's dead?
because no one did look it in the eye.

## and mrs. norris?
i m pretty sure she didn't have a camera or a mirror, harry.

## but how's a basilisk been getting around?
a dirty, great snake.

## pipes?
it s using the plumbing.

## what if she never left?
moaning myrtle.

## what have i missed?
a girl has been snatched by the monster, lockhart.

## weren't you saying just last night...... that you've known all along where the entrance to the chamber of secrets is?
that's settled.

## who is it that the monster's taken, minerva?
ginny weasley.

## are you going somewhere?
well, yes.

## what about my sister?
books can be misleading.

## is there anything you can do?
yes, now you mention it.

## who's there?
hello, harry.

## what do you want?
to ask you how you died.

## who was it, myrtle?
i don't know.

## how?
i just remember seeing a pair of great, big, yellow eyes...... over there by that sink.

## now, boys, what good will it do?
better you than us.

## sure you don't want to test it first?
it s really quite filthy down here.

## oh, harry?
lf you die down there, you're welcome to share my toilet.

## what's this?
i m fine.

## who are you?
ron weasley.

## and who am l?
lockhart's memory charm backfired.

## do you live here?
no.

## what do i do now?
you wait here...... and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back through.

## she's not...?
she's still alive, but only just.

## are you a ghost?
a memory...... preserved in a diary for 50 years.

## but why?
because i told her to.

## and then who should find it but you?
the very person i was most anxious to meet.

## and why did you want to meet me?
i knew i had to talk to you, meet you if i could.

## and you framed him, didn't you?
it was my word against hagrid's.

## haven't i told you?
killing mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore.

## why do you care how i escaped?
voldemort was after your time.

## surely you didn't think...... i was going to keep my filthy muggle father's name?
no.

## fawkes?
so this is what dumbledore sends his great defender.

## remarkable, isn't it...... how quickly the venom of the basilisk penetrates the body?
i d guess you have little more than a minute to live.

## what are you doing?
stop.

## am i right, harry?
it s just....

## why?
because lord voldemort can speak parseltongue.

## voldemort transferred some of his powers to me?
not intentionally...... but yes.

## why, then, did the sorting hat place you in gryffindor?
my sole concern has always been and will always be...... the welfare of this school...... and, of course, its students.

## the culprit has been identified, i presume?
yes.

## who was it?
voldemort.

## i wonder if i could have that?
mr. malfoy.

## mine?
i don't know what you're talking about.

## why don't you prove it?
come, dobby.

## harry potter freed dobby.
what?

## how can dobby ever repay him?
just promise me something.

## could i have your attention, please?
also, in light of the recent events...... as a school treat...... all exams have been canceled.

## five?
four, when that picture was taken.

## burden of command, correct?
look.

## it's too late for what?
for your offer.

## my resignation?
you're a disgrace, colonel.

## tell me, mr. irwin, what's to stop me from just... placing you in the hole... for, say, six months?
nothing.

## now, you wouldn't want to give up all these perks, would you?
sorry.

miss kelly, i got everything here but...

## what, danny?
i found that top one...

## what i care about is you and getting you out of here.
but without any new evidence, what would be the point?

## now, haven't you punished yourself enough?
what i did was wrong, jim.

## for christ's sake, will you work with me?
because, you know, no castle can have two kings.

## what are you doing?
return to hangar.

## you thought he was gonna try to take me hostage?
yes, it was a precautionary move.

## what the hell kind of... grab ass unit are you running here, colonel?

correct.

## is that correct?
yeah.

## and how many years... did they take off your sentence for... that?
four years, sir.

## tell me, yates, how does a man like you... get into west point?
my father was a winner of the congressional medal of honor, sir.

## your father was a pow with mr. irwin, was he not?
crusade.

## why is that?
it's not my fight.

## mr. irwin is in a fight?
it says here you have three years...

## correct?
that's what it says.

## does three months sound better?
i need to resolve this situation... quickly... before someone else gets hurt... or killed.

## do you agree?
i guess.

## how many times you gonna ask?
stop your sniveling.

## to succeed in a castle war, you have to overcome the garrison, take the high ground... and ultimately capture the flag.
well, when?

## okay?
enriquez.

## you set up a command post, okay?
and here, you have the guard well, here.

## okay?
phase one, neutralize winter's guards.

yeah.

## and how many years... did they take off your sentence for... that?

yes, that is correct.

## crusade?
crusade.

## why is that?
it's not my fight.

## mr. irwin is in a fight?
it says here you have three years...

## correct?
that's what it says.

## does three months sound better?
i need to resolve this situation... quickly... before someone else gets hurt... or killed.

## do you agree?
i guess.

## how many times you gonna ask?
stop your sniveling.

## to succeed in a castle war, you have to overcome the garrison, take the high ground... and ultimately capture the flag.

enriquez.

## you set up a command post, okay?
and here, you have the guard...

## okay?
phase one, neutralize winter's guards.

## no?
i promise i'll make it a memorable moment.

## isn't that a fundamental paradox?
yes.

## why'd you catch that?
it was gonna fall.

## you're certain?
but it didn't fall.

## you ever get any false positives?
someone intends to kill, but doesn't.

## how do the pre cogs tell the difference?
they don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.

## why can't they see rapes, assaults, suicides?
because of the nature of murder.

## to hineman?
to them.

## you've never been inside?
we keep strict separation so that no one can be accused of tampering.

## i'll be the first one to go in then?
maybe you didn't hear me.

## yeah?
go to work.

## what does he think of your work?
i don't know.

## what'd you do?

drowning.

## this about the justice department?
i'm supposed to spruce up for a tour they got tomorrow.

## you like this tie?
stop.

## this is the composite of the three?
that's right.

## why wasn't he id'd from the eye scan?
those are not his eyes.

## see?
we have the two previsions.

## where is she now?
i guess glitches come in twos.

## anything else against the rules?
careful, chief.

## the third prevision was what, kind of fuzzy or something?
no, the third prevision, agatha's prevision, wasn't there.

## what's this?
herbal tea with honey.

## can i get you anything, john?
no, thank you.

## what?
she's worried about you.

## what if danny witwer insisted on a full chem run?
i'm fine.

## how is an old man and a cop on the whiff ever going to stop them?
they choose you.

## yeah?
we're called the crescos.

## yeah?
we practice at school.

## with connor?
we're in motion on something.

## red ball?
nope.

## are you ready to preview and validate 1109?
ready when you are, john.

## you say something, chief?
no.

## mind getting me a piece of cake they're eating?
i'm starving.

## chief anderton, what is this that i'm seeing?
i'm confused about...

## what are you gonna do?
possession will cost you six months and your badge.

## john, what is happening?
it's witwer.

## who's the victim?
somebody.

## who?
somebody...

## but i'm supposed to kill him in less than 36 hours.
who is he?

## can you?
i doubt it.

## would hineman know?
now listen, come in.

## what?
i'll protect you until we get to the bottom of this.

## who's leo crow?
security lockdown enabled.

## is there any way to override the lockdown?
no, no, no.

## no?
i'll meet you anywhere you say.

## oh, my gosh, are you okay?
i'll bring him in.

## what?
fletcher is second in command.

## what did you talk about?
the mets.

## why are you protecting him?
you knew he was doping, yet you did nothing.

## what did you talk about?
none of your business.

## john?
don't run.

## got a grip?
yeah.

## this just isn't your week, is it?
chief anderton.

## just what is it you think i can do for you?
you could tell me how someone can fake a prevision.

## how would i know that?
because you invented precrime.

## what's so funny?
if the consequences of several genetic mistakes and science gone haywire...... can be called an invention, then i invented precrime.

## heal who?
the innocents we use to stop the guilty.

## you think they came from a test tube?
they are merely the ones who survived.

## you say some of the children died?
so many of them.

## it's a perfect system now, isn't it?
i'm not going to commit murder.

## you won't help?
i can't help you.

## what?
jesus christ.

## why didn't i know about this?
because these minority reports are destroyed the instant they occur.

## why?
for precrime to function, there can't be any suggestion of fallibility.

## who wants a justice system that instills doubt?
it may be reasonable, but it's still doubt.

## are you saying i've haloed innocent people?
i'm saying that every so often, those accused of a precrime...... just might have an alternate future.

## does burgess know about this, about this minority report?
i used to joke with lamar that we were the parents of precrime.

## does lamar burgess know about the minority report?
yes, of course, he knew.

## but what about those people that i put away with alternate futures?
my god, if the country knew...

## do you really?
you wanna bring it down.

## why should i trust you?
you shouldn't trust anyone.

## what safe place is that?
the safest place there is.

## where is it?
inside the pre cog who predicted it.

## that's all, huh?
just walk into precrime, get into the temple...... somehow tap into these pre cogs and download this minority report.

## how do i even know which one has it?
it's always in the more gifted of the three.

## which one is that?
the female.

## why won't he just run?
because he thinks he's innocent.

## where is she?
started blowing buttons for no reason whatsoever, and i knew that.

## you do understand i can't just give you new irises?
please, don't touch.

## what was that?
it's anesthesia.

## you always sneak up on your patients?
you wouldn't break the hand of a violinist before the concert.

## why?
because my mother gave them to me.

## what's it to you?
you can't resell them.

## what did you give me?
smile medicine.

## we know each other?
yes, we do.

## d. c.?
baltimore.

## baltimore?
we go way back.

## you remember?
specialized in burn victims, mostly women.

## the future's so much more interesting than the past, don't you think?
miss van eyck.

## how can i do what i do now?
let's say that i spent an awful lot of time in the prison library.

## this your work?
yes.

## how do you take your coffee?
cream and sugar.

## you and john ever come here?
we used to.

## he's not here now, is he?
i had to ask.

## he hasn't tried to contact you?
no.

## did he ever mention the name leo crow?
no, but i don't talk to john much anymore.

## have you been there recently?
it's full of these.

## how long has he been doping?
since right after we lost our son.

## what was it then?
the fbi found something that belonged to my son, a sandal.

## so what?
you lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.

## understand?
in the fridge, there's milk.

## the bathroom?
now that's your right hand.

## what is this?
it'll turn your pretty face into mush.

## understand?
25.

## is it a world record?
it's a personal best.

## how long can a whale hold its breath?
for about 20 minutes.

## you sure you don't wanna go for an ice cream?
because you know i'm gonna beat that whale.

## ready?
sean.

## have you seen...?
i'm looking for my son.

## you seen my boy?
he's wearing a red bathing suit.

## you must really like me, don't you?
that's why you asked to partner with me on this sortie.

## that you think i might, you know, futz with him?
no, i just wanna watch him use your body to sandblast another building.

## four spyders, one per floor?
let's do eight.

## a drunk, maybe can't wake up?
or a guy who doesn't want to get read.

## four?
there's anderton, crow and the man in sunglasses.

## why?
because precrime works.

## can we see the pre cogs?
they have such a powerful gift, they're kept in peaceful seclusion...... so as not to be distracted.

## what are you doing here?
easy there, old timer.

## who cleared you?
you're not allowed here.

## do i know you?
i like you.

## who does that look like to you?
i don't know.

## are these all of her previsions?
i'm rewinding her right now.

## can you see?
he's inside.

## is there another way out of there?
all the doors are covered.

## what does he want with a pre cog?
so he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing.

## the other two can still function, right?
they're a hive mind.

## they can't see murders anymore?
agatha, she's the key.

## how much time have we got, gordon?
we've got...... 51 minutes, 30 seconds.

## are you cold?
the shivers, it's the drugs we gave you.

## is it now?
yes, this is all happening right now.

## if it's ransom, where's the damn note?
it has nothing to do with ransom.

## what's your pleasure?
you can experience sex as a woman.

## you got some images i can work with?
rufus.

## why'd you come here?
i make house calls.

## are you reading my mind right now?

## so?
so i need you to hack into her.

## are you recording this?

## what happened?
i don't know.

## what happened?
i don't...

## where's the rest of it?
i guess that's all of it.

## do i have one?
no.

## what?
no.

## see what?
anne lively.

## are you recording this?

## do you know who i am?
you're somebody's father.

## is he alive?
he's alive.

## i'm so very sorry.
where have you got him?

## how could you do that to my...?

## you're not gonna kill me?
if you don't go through with this, my family gets nothing.

## who's he?
i don't know.

## if you did what?
if i acted like i killed your kid.

## if you killed my kid?
look, you don't kill me, my family gets nothing.

## what about the pictures?
they're fake.

## who was it that set this up?
i don't know.

## who put you up to this?
i didn't see his face.

## who made you do this?
kill me.

## if you were a child killer, would you leave these photos out?
anderton might have found them.

## what kind of cop were you before this?
treasury agent.

## this will be your first murder scene?
i worked homicide before federal.

## how many?
none.

## what?
there's something wrong.

## you got this from containment?
yes.

## so the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
danny, just tell me what you're thinking.

## how?
jad told me that sometimes the pre cogs see the same murder more than once.

## what if he was looking at a completely different murder altogether?
i don't understand.

## do you know what i hear?
nothing.

## do you know why?
because right now, the pre cogs can't see a thing.

## can you see?
it's beautiful.

## where are we going?
someplace safe.

## is the pre cog with him?
keep them there.

## you just don't let john leave, all right?
he's no killer, lamar.

## you remember when i would read tom sawyer to you and sean?
he got so scared when tom and becky were lost in the cave.

## why would they set you up?
because i found out about her.

## seen what?
anne lively.

## can't you see?
she just wanted her little girl back.

## who killed anne lively?
i'm sorry, john, but you're gonna have to run again.

## why sam?
sam, wake up.

## i take it i was having a nightmare?
yeah, another one.

## are we here?
yep.

## so, what do you think really happened to this guy?
so what we're gonna find out.

## can i help you?
yeah, we're the... med students.

## sorry?
oh, doctor...

## fliglavitch didn't tell you?
we talked to him on the phone.

## you don't mind showing us the body, do you?
sorry, i can't.

## an hour?
we got to be heading back to columbus.

## any sign of a struggle, maybe somebody did it to him?
nope.

## what's the official causeof death?
doc's not sure.

## what do you mean?
intense cerebral bleeding.

## what would cause something like that?
capillaries can burst.

## yeah, you ever see exploding eyeballs?
that's a first for me.

## might just be some freak medical thing.
think we could take a look atthat police report?

## how many times in dad's long and varied career has it actually been a freak medical thing and not some sign of an awful supernatural death?
uh, almost never.

## you must be donna, right?
yeah.

## it's okay, i'm okay.
you did?

## dizziness, migraines?
no.

## what?
i'm sorry, she's just upset.

## lily, why would you saysomething like that?
right before he died, i said it.

## you said what?
bloody mary, three times in the bathroom mirror.

## your dad didn't say it, did he?
no, i don't think so.

## sam:the bloody mary legend dad ever find any evidence that it was a real thing?
not that i know of.

## the place where the legend began?
but according to the legend, the person who says...

## what are you doingup here?
we... we had to go to the bathroom.

## who are you?
like we said downstairs, we worked with donna's dad.

## no, i know, i meant... and those weird questions downstairs, what was that?
so you tell me what's going on or i start screaming.

## like what?
honestly, we don't know yet.

## who are you, cops?
something like that.

## what are we supposed to be looking for?
every version's got thingsin common.

## you didn't think so?
yeah, okay, they were cute.

## but, still, do you think something could have happenedto donna's dad?
maybe lily was right.

## was that fear i hear in your voice?
no.

## you killed that boy.
jill?

## so, what did you dream about?
lollipops and candy canes.

## oh, besides a whole new level of frustration?
no.

## hello?
and they found her on the bathroom floor.

## i'm insane, right?
no, you're not insane.

## what did you tell jill's mom?
i just said i needed some time alone with jill's pictures and things.

## what are you guys looking for?
we'll let you know as soon as we find it.

## do i look like paris hilton?
so, i don't get it.

## how's she choosing them?
beats me.

## you know who that is?
no.

## what?
jill drove that car.

## why are you asking me this?
look, we're sorry, but it's important.

## linda's my mom, okay?
and she overdosed on sleeping pills.

## do you really think her dad could have killed her mom?
maybe.

## you're doing a nationwide search?
yep.

## why mary's choosing a victim?
it seems like there's a pattern.

## what exactly happened?
yeah.

## you know who it was?
not for sure.

## now, why would he do something like that?
her diary mentioned a man she was seeing.

## but how do you know it was sampson who killed her?
it's hard to say.

## but you could never prove it?
no.

## is he still alive?
nope.

## where's she buried?
she wasn't.

## it's not in evidence lockup somewhere, is it?
no.

## i mean, you bring these strangers into my house, and they ask me things like that?
they were only trying to help.

## about bloody mary?
please, i know it sounds crazy.

## but you?
think about the way your dad died, okay, and the way jill died.

## see?
nothing happened.

## why would you do that?
ah, that's too bad, mr. worthington.

## so?
so, that was mary's brother.

## so wherever the mirror goes, that's where mary goes?
her spirit's definitely tied up with it somehow.

## isn't there an old superstition that says mirrors can capture spirits?
yeah, there is.

## maybe.
yeah, but how could she move through 100 different mirrors?

## charlie?
hey.

## it's okay, all right?
now, listen.

## i'm gonna die, aren't i?
no.

## can you tell us about it?
i had this boyfriend.

## but he kind of scared me, too, you know?
and... one night at his house, we got in this fight.

## and you know what i said?
and i left.

## how could i leave him like that?
i just...

## i didn't believe him, you know?
i should have.

## mary's hard to pin down, right?
and she moves around from mirror to mirror.

## so, who's to say that she's not gonna just keep hiding in them forever?
so maybe... we should try to pin her down, you know, summon her to her mirror and then smash it.

## i'm not for sure.
well, how do you know that's gonna work?

## well, who's gonnasummon her?
i will.

## all right, you know what?
that's it.

## you think that's your dirty little secret, that you killed her somehow?
sam, this has got to stop, man.

## or, hell, why don't you take a swing at me?
i'm the one that dragged you away from her the first place.

## i don't what?
you don't know all about it.

## it wouldn't really be a secret if i told you, would it?
no.

## who knows how many more people are gonna die after that?
now, we're doing this.

## you sure about this?
bloody mary.

## who are you?
i'm the boss's kid.

## you're mr. yamashiro's kid?
come on.

## but it's more than that, isn't it?
those nightmares you've been having of jessica dying, screaming, burning you had them for days before she died.

## it's sam.
how could you ignore them like that?

## god, are you okay?
yeah, it's over.

## charlie?
your boyfriend's death, you really should try to forgive yourself.

## no, i got to findjessica's killer.
hey, sam?

## um... oh, god. too martha stewart?
here, wear this.

## i'd think you brought me hereon purpose.
so?

## what?
i'm offended.

## do you want to get that?
definitely not.

## what was that?
i don't know.

## just wait here.
what is that?

## what the hell?
okay.

## so, anything?
i had them check the fbi's missing persons databank.

## but what if it is?
dad would check it out.

## why are we here?
victim lived here.

## who are you?
we're your new roommates.

## what?
we heard one of the guys heregot killed last week.

## what happened?
they're saying some psychowith a knife, maybe a drifterpassing through.

## rich was with somebody?
not just somebody lori sorenson.

## who's lori sorenson?
you missed a spotdown on the back.

## you wouldn't happen to knowwhich church, would you?
and now, as time healsall our wounds, we should reflect onwhat this tragedy means to us as a church. h...

## are you lori?
yeah.

## listen, we're new in town, actually, and we're looking for a... tell me, lori, what are the police saying?
well, they don't have a lotto go on.

## what do you mean?
my story.

## dean:so you believe her?
i do.

## what about the scratchesand the tire punctures and the invisible killer?
maybe the hookmanisn't a man at all.

## what if it's some kindof spirit?
here you go.

## this is how you spent fourgood years of your life, huh?
welcome to higher education.

## get this the murder weapon?
looks like the preacherlost his hand in an accident, had it replacedwith a silver hook.

## dad, do we have to havethis argument again?
i'm over 18. i can live my own life.

## taylor, are you awake?
here you go.

## that's pretty good. you and dad think of this?
i told you, you don't have to be a collegegraduate to be a genius.

## i'm matlock. but how?
told him you werea dumb ass pledge and that we were hazing you.

## what about the shotgun?
i said that you werehunting ghosts and that spiritsare repelled by rock salt.

## and he believed you?
well, you look likea dumb ass pledge.

## why would the hookmanhave come here?
this is a long wayfrom 9 mile road.

## try and be quiet, will you?
me be quiet? you be quiet.

## aren't you gladyou didn't turn on the light?
that's right outof the legend.

## does that look familiarto you?
it's the same symbol.

## did you do your homework?
yeah, it was bugging me.

## how is the hookman tiedwith lori?
i think i came upwith something.

## what's the connectionto lori?
a man of religion who openlypreaches against immorality.

## do you thinkhe's summoning the spirit?
maybe.

## or you knowhow a poltergeist can haunt a person insteadof a place?
the spirit latches onto thereverend's repressed emotions, feeds off them.

## what about you?
i'm gonna go see if i can findthat unmarked grave.

## what are you doing here?
i'm keeping an eyeon the place.

## about me?
yeah, sorry.

## why would you say that?
it's like i'm cursedor something.

## and you knowwhat my dad will say?
pave faith.

## what does he knowabout faith?
i just don't knowwhat to think anymore.

## sam?
lori, i can't.

## that someone you lost?
i'm sorry.

## a big man carryinga weapon, some kind of a hook?
yes, sir.

## ever seen him before?
no, sir.

## you okay?
yeah.

## what the hell happened?
hookman.

## you saw him?
damn right.

## why didn't you torchthe bones?
i did.

## are you sure it'sthe spirit of jacob karns?
sure as hell looked like him. and that's not all.

## so what?
so, she's upset about it.

## why didn't that stop him?
you must've missedsomething.

## the hook?
it was the murder weapon, and in a wayit was part of him.

## barnabas church.
does it mention the hook?

## isn't that where lori'sfather preaches?
yeah.

## i mean, a blood stained, silver handled hook?
check the church records.

## what is it?
i've been trying to understandwhat's been happening, why.

## don't you see?
i'm to blame for all this.

## why is he still here?
maybe we missed something.

## lori, where did you getthat chain?
my father gave it to me.

## where'd your dad get it?
it was a church heirloom. he gave it to me.

## is it silver?
yes.

## and you saw him, too, the man with the hook?
yes, i told you. we all saw him.

## and that's all?
yeah, that's all.

i'd appreciate it if you wouldn't take things off my desk.

## what can i do for you, mr...?
meiks.

## who?
you haven't even heard me out yet and already you doubt me.

## why is that?
because in a case like this nobody just walks in the office and tells you who the killer is.

## so who is it then?
my brother.

## what makes you think that?
i got a call from him...

## hello?
demons are taking over the world.

## why did you go to thurman?
to bury adam, in the rose garden.

## why would you do that?
i promised him i would.

## did he tell you that before he asked you to take him to thurman?
if that's the case, you left that part out.

## oh, there's more?
a lot more.

## can i talk to a sheriff, please?
this is agent doyle of the fbl.

## may i help you?
well, i've got a man here in my office, name of fenton meiks.

## you know him?
he caused a ruckus here earlier.

## did my story check out?
yeah, it did.

## so am i under arrest now?
you damn sure should be.

## why would you go to all that trouble just to walk in here and confess it to me?
i'm here because i can't live with what i know anymore.

## that is your mother, isn't it?
yeah, it is.

## why don t we get back to your story?
i know it was him.

## how do you know?

## dad?

well... we can see the demons while other people can't.

## magical weapons?
i imagine so.

## when do we get them?
i don't know.

## fenton?
don't worry, it's okay.

## fenton?
i didn t know what to say or how to feel.

## do you understand what i told you?
judgment day is here.

## what's wrong with you?
nothing.

## do you remember what this word means?
the dream had finally ended.

## where did you get this, adam?
god gave it to me.

## isn't travis shed that boy that was picking on you at school last week?
he's a demon.

## you made this list up yourself, didn't you?
no, god did.

## adam?
come on, right here.

## you understand?
i'm sorry, dad.

## when's dad coming home?
i don't know.

## think he's destroying a demon?
it's all make believe, adam.

## you remember when you caught dad putting our presents under the tree?
it's just like that.

## adam, have i ever lied to you?
all right, look.

## but why would he make it up?
i don't know.

## but we might have to.
you mean... run away?

## why?
dad's gonna kill somebody.

## dad?
come on out here, adam.

## hey, dad, who is that?
that's a demon, son.

## yes?
dad, don't.

## where's your father now?
dead.

## so he killed that woman right there in front of you?
but not to his way of thinking.

## why out here in the rose garden?
god chose it.

## didn't you see when i touched her?
i saw it, dad.

## you... you're gonna do it again?
this is our job now, son.

## do you understand?
answer me, fenton.

## so you didn't tell?
no.

## have you got any physical proof?
i read in the paper that only one of the bodies of the 6 victims had been found.

## you read it in the papers, didn't you?
it doesn't necessarily mean it's true.

## how do you know they're dead?
oh, we don't for sure.

## would you have believed me?
come on.

## what's this?
put them on.

## why didn't you come see me sooner?
you're gonna wanna get on 30 east up here.

## did they ever catch him?
no.

## is that why you took this job?
you're pretty good at this.

## you ever think about becoming a cop?
well, you know, when i was a kid.

## you know what mine are telling me now?
you're hiding something from me.

## why don't you just keep talking?
maybe i'll figure it out.

## you okay, dad?
i'm all right son.

## dad, why did god let this happen to me?
don t blame god, davy.

## remember when daisy duke bent over?
i like boss hogg.

## you wanna spend the night tonight?
we can wrap corey's house.

## dad?
in here.

## whose van is that out there?
ours.

## ain't she a beauty?
you friend's mom just called.

## fenton?
i can't do this, dad.

## well, what if someone sees us?
my dog... she's under your car.

## you think that's an innocent man there, don't you?
well, it's not.

## you didn't think anyone knew about that, did you?
but god saw you.

## what do you mean?
gotta run away.

## why?
listen to me, adam.

## what?
it doesn't matter.

## what?
you heard me.

## why?
because i'm your father and you'll do what i tell you.

## do you?
sorry i told on you.

## you tell him about running away?
no.

## will you go with me then?
there's no reason to go.

## besides, there was nowhere to go.
have you been praying?

## finally gave up, huh, kiddo?
i'll be there again in the morning.

## what's the matter with you?
nothing.

## didn't you wear gloves today?
i didn't need them.

## then you can get back to it, all right?
well, good night then.

## please, dad?
come on.

## betcha you didn't pray once the whole time, did you?
nope.

## well, what do you think?
all right.

## hello?
take it easy, boys.

## well, what's your problem?
craziest thing i've heard in a long time.

## what are you doing?
calling your dad.

## what's the trouble, sheriff?
sorry to wake you, but your boy here seems to have a problem.

## what does get me, though, is why would he make up such a crazy story?
i don't know why he made it up.

## did you tell him about that?
he's lying.

## why don't you just quit all this?
please, i can show you.

## see?
i figured we ought to have a storm cellar.

## you realize the trouble you could get into over a thing like this?
they must have moved him because he was here.

## why can't you see that?
you didn't have to kill him.

## he's dead because you have no faith.
you see him?

## come in and shut the door.
do you understand what you made me do?

## of what?
you.

## and you're not a demon, are you?
the angel said you were.

## you know what s funny about all this, fenton?
adam, you gotta get me out of here.

## you ready?
here.

## i'll pray for you.
a week?

## adam?
the days came and went.

## didn't he ever come back to at least check on you?
on the seventh day.

## has god spoken to you yet?
there is no god.

## what?
come on, kiddo.

## don't want to eat too fast, you'll make yourself sick.
dad?

## so did god tell you about the demons?
sorry i ever doubted you.

## what did god look like?

## mind if we just sit here?
i don't much feel like talking anymore.

## adam?
if you ever destroy me, promise me you'll bury me here.

## he promised you that he'd bury you here?
yeah.

## you thought your brother was a demon?
he was.

## adam?
jesus christ, you really do believe all this stuff.

## she's dead and her killer got away, didn't he?
goddamn you.

## how did you know?

you can't run a vacuum cleaner on 12 amps, john.

## what if they need to do another burn?
they won't even know which way they're pointed.

## that's the deal?
that's the deal.

## huh?
good, you're not dead.

## jesus, john, what are you doing here?
i gotta get you in the simulators.

## what?
there's been an explosion.

## what about the crew?
crew's fine so far.

## how much power do we have to play with?
barely enough to run this coffee pot for nine hours.

## ken, you know what's going on?
john's brought me up to speed.

## what do we have left in the batteries?
we don't really know.

## you know how short?
it's all in the sequencing.

## you started on a procedure?
the engineers have tried, but it's your ship.

## what's up?
no more waste dumps.

## ls it a. m. or p. m.?
a. m. very, very a. m.

## could you sleep up there?
it's gonna get cold in there for them.

## what about the scrubbers on the command module?
they take square cartridges.

## don't you ever sleep?
i have a request from the news people.

## transmitter?
look, i, um, realize how hard this is, marilyn, but the whole world is caught up in it.

## it could cost us amp hours on the back end?
that's a possibility.

## have they called up with a reentry plan yet?
hold on.

## how'd you figure that?
i can add.

## what are you saying, fred?
i think you know what i'm saying.

## aquarius, this is houston.
what was that gauge reading before you hit the switch?

## are we on vox?
no, we're not on vox.

## yeah, jim, could you check your co2 gauge for us?
yeah, houston, we were just looking at that.

## what do we do about it?
we're working on a procedure down here for you.

## do you copy?
oh, christ.

## what's this?
that's what they gotta make.

## that's it?
all right, aquarius, this is houston.

## do you have a flight plan?
affirmative, andy.

## what about their level of carbon dioxide?
it's, uh, climbing.

## you're saying that they're almost out of breathable air?
wait a second.

## all right?
they just tore the bag.

## so how does this flight compare to other emergency situations you've faced?
i'd have to say that this is the most serious situation... we've ever encountered in manned space flight.

## which one has the leak?
don't know that yet, john.

## you need a break, ken?
lf they don't get one, i don't get one.

## are you scared?
well, don't you worry, honey.

## what's up?
something about another course correction.

## without the computer, what do we use for orientation?
we've got to be able to give these guys something.

## houston, what's the story with this burn?
we're trying to hash something out down here, aquarius.

## ls that not correct?
yeah.

## can they fly it manually and still shut it down... on time without the computer?
i guess that's the best we can do.

## it will ignite, will it not?
i just want you to know the engine's never been tried like this.

## you up to this, freddo?
guess you can keep your job.

## well, if the chutes don't open, what's the point?
you're telling me what you need.

## ls there an instance in an airplane emergency when you can recall fear?
i remember one time, i'm in a banshee at night in combat conditions, so there's no running lights on the carrier.

## how's it going, fred?
i'm okay.

## what the hell was that?
let's hope it was just the burst disk.

## houston, can you confirm a burst helium disk?
we confirm that.

## houston, is that going to affect our, uh, entry angle at all?
uh, negative.

## when can we expect that?
uh, that's coming real soon, aquarius.

## what's the story?
we're gonna get that power up procedure to you.

## ken's working on it?
look...

## by how much?
four.

## we know they have some power left in the lem batteries, right?
yeah.

## do we have a procedure for that?
you're gonna lose a lot in the transfer, ken.

## how am i reading?
fine, so far.

## ken?
go ahead.

## ls your computer on now?
up and running.

## john?
i think we got it, buddy.

## arthur, my notes are clear on that last sequence, right?
excuse me, gentlemen.

## was it tried on the hardware yet?
we didn't have time.

## do you read?
yeah, we read you, ken.

## are the flowers blooming in houston?
uh, that's a negative, jim.

## jim, is jack in there with you?
uh, yeah, stand by one.

## are you boys in the space program too?
okay, jack, give me a read back on that last procedure.

## what's the word on these things shorting out?
uh, we'll just take that one at a time, jack.

## now how could they be underweight?
we didn't land on the moon.

## rocks?
that's affirm.

## ballast?
um, that's affirm.

## okay, ken, uh, uplink telemetry, command module to accept, right?
that's affirm.

## can you see that?
oh, man, that's incredible.

## did jim make eagle scout or not?
yes, he did.

## you okay?
i'm, uh i'm freezing.

## can you hold out just a little longer?
long as i have to.

## ls everyone strapped in, ken?
we're getting real close.

## have you got everybody in the odyssey?
yeah, ken, i'm gonna check those pyro batteries one more time here.

## what is that?
oh, i was getting a little punchy, and i didn't want to cut the lem loose with you guys still in it.

## mary?
it's almost time, honey.

## okay, but now i'm asking you, when will we know?
well, blackout lasts for three minutes.

## fred, how are the batteries looking?
okay.

## ls there anything we can do about it?
not now, flight.

## then they don't need to know, do they?
copy that.

## retro says the typhoon is still a presence in the splashdown area?
yeah.

## will the command module survive the intense heat of reentry?
lf it doesn't, there'll only be silence.

## do you read me?
odyssey, this is houston.

## do you read?
expected time of reacquisition, the time when the astronauts were expected to come out of blackout, has come and gone.

## do you read me?
odyssey, houston.

## do you read?
three minutes, 30 seconds.

## do you read?
odyssey, this is houston.

## do you read me?
that's four minutes.

## do you read?
hello, houston, this is odyssey.

## what's this?
well...

## what is this?
it's my gun.

## your gun?
don't hurt me.

## what?
do that thing again.

## who wants a beer?
i do.

## you and me?
you and me are like this.

## look, just because you're moving up to homicide, don't take me off your speed dial, ok?
no, no, no.

## ok?
i'm gonna miss you.

## what the fuck is this, the peanut gallery?
god.

## what?
oh, nothing.

## what precinct?
have it your way, stranger.

## hi.
you wanna dance?

## hey, how you doing?
back up, boys, you're breathing my air.

## what's up, commissioner?
hey.

## i think i'd be getting a promotion too.
leo, how you doing?

## yeah, is that right?
yeah.

## well, you know what?
i'm just here to have a good time, man.

## or is it that you just can't do it?
i could do it.

## you know what?
i'm off duty, man.

## shepard?
go.

## you pass the written?
yeah, of course.

## how could i not?
trained by the master.

## really, grasshopper?
well, the master is amazed at how badly you almost fucked it up.

## what?
well, a moment ago, you demonstrated you still know how to process a room.

## so tell me this, how did that psycho get a knife to your throat?
no.

## copy that?
copy.

## i mean, what kind of moron tries to flush body parts down a toilet, especially when he's got a perfectly good furnace out back?
i'm gonna head out.

## where you been hiding?
this is your night.

## everything all right?
yeah.

## panic attacks?
nothing.

## really?
let's get something straight.

## ok?
unless i'm convinced a crime is about to be committed or you are a danger to yourself.

## anything else?
you're hoping i have some big problems.

## so you did kick culter?
hands break, feet don't.

## what's once in a while?
oh, you've got to be kidding me.

## do i look like the kidding type?
delmarco.

## so how come you didn't say anything in the bar last night?
i couldn't.

## who?
you.

## i mean, isn't that some form of entrapment?
then she handcuffs me, i'm down on my knees.

## come on, isn't there some law against police brutality, sir?
i'm going through a lot of pain and suffering, mr. porter.

## ok?
i know your little dirty side.

## is that a problem?
raymond porter.

## ever make a mistake?
yeah, you know what i'm talking about.

## would you excuse us?
i need to speak with jessica for a minute.

## maybe you know someone who could help you with that?
i think about that night.

## right?
i guess culter did impact my life.

## do i pass?
well, almost.

## you sure?
i barely remember my parents.

## what's your secret?
jessica, listen to me.

## hello?
be outside.

## how are you, wilson?
all right.

## you remember wilson, my old patrol partner?
hi.

## any signs of cause of death?
i don't know, man.

## what's the score?
we're up three, top of the fifth.

## ok, what have we got here?
let's take a look.

## so?
we should check the tide charts.

## hey, lopez, my key still good?
yeah, mike.

## you all right?
don't sweat it, you'll get used to it.

## nothing more you can tell us?
i told you, i don't really know the guy.

## but you said you were intimate?
i picked up a stranger in a bar and had sex with him.

## you ever picked up a woman in a bar, lieutenant?
yeah, in my fantasy life.

## what is she, a suspect?
come on, we got the call.

## shepard?
we'll talk later.

## you live there?
you're one big surprise after another, stranger.

## you up for finding out who done it?
ok, inspector, back to work.

## well, i assume you checked the victim's cuffs last night, right?
i also assume that you would've seen there was sand inside those cuffs, which tells us...

## delmarco, shepard, where are you guys on yours?
crime scene is clean.

## anything else?
all right, let's break it up.

## spotlight withdrawal?
here's some advice i like to share with new inspectors.

## ok?
your boyfriend.

## yeah?
bridge patrol found another floater.

## how much did we drink last night?
well, maybe next time you should go easy on the sangria.

## big inspector now, so you don't call me back ever, right?
i guess that's the reason.

## you patrol guys wanna rustle me up some breakfast?
a little bacon, eggs, toast, black coffee.

## how's that?
right there.

## how did you know there'd be another body?
there was that cigarette burn on the back of the hand.

## what's up?
could be the killer's.

## at one point, you did suffer from some stress related symptoms.
how soon will you know?

## is that what you've got there?
my parents had died and i was sad.

## what if you're in danger?
fucking phone.

## you all right?
yeah...... just a few rats under the car.

## you know what i mean?
you know, sometimes i wonder if maybe i hadn't told him about her.

## inspector shepard as a suspect?
that's very funny, dale.

## i mean, we know she slept with victim number one, right?
sure.

## so do we know if she slept with victim number two?
i mean, shit, shepard, he is kind of cute.

## you wanna know the punch line?
i did sleep with victim number two.

## why the hell did you do something like that?
listen, brother, it is none of your business who i sleep with.

## anyone got, like, a sick fixation on you, might be stalking you?
lately, i've...... sort of felt like i'm being watched.

## do we pull her off the case?
no.

## backing you up?
i was just giving my professional opinion.

## just what the hell do you think you're doing?
i'm not doing anything.

## yeah?
well, that's not what i hear.

## and what's going on with you and this delmarco genius?
for god's sake, john.

## is that why people keep dying around you?
nice.

## did i say that out loud?
hey, i know you.

## you're a cop?
i don't believe it.

## who'd you see him with?
look, the only person i've ever seen that guy leave the bar with, aside from his girlfriend, was you.

## did mr. geber have many regular visitors?
the last person i saw him with looked a lot like you.

## you find out anything up there?
we just wasted the entire day tracking down me.

## what do you want?
i'm kidding.

## don't you miss me just a little?
i miss you.

## how many times do we have to go over it?
you know, it just...

## jim...
you know what?

## when did you first find out?
when did you realize...

## to take a human life?
you know, we all have it in us.

## what the hell are you doing here with my client?
a little police work.

## you got that?
you don't have to have a hissy fit, ray.

## ok?
only in my presence.

## i am not having a hissy fit, ok?
i am protecting my client's interests here.

## oh, yeah?
yeah.

## what did i do?
oh, yeah.

## what the hell is that supposed to mean?
well, i will explain it to you in detail.

## so we have our killer's blood?
well, the bad news is, he wasn't in the system.

## that's all, huh?
hey, that's why they pay you homicide guys the big bucks.

## bring your good pal lisa a little blood sample, will you?
and i, one of law and order's little people, will burn the midnight oil, doing the task, making the match that will lock that fucker up.

## and you get all the glory, and what, do you ask, do i get?
hey, perhaps a dinner at chez panisse.

## still going over all those unanswered questions?
you got something to say to me, becker, quit being such a pussy and come out and say it.

## are you listening to me?
i know about you.

## are you thinking about hitting me right now?
go ahead.

## yeah, who is it?
it's jess.

## what?
i'm sorry.

## where the hell do you think you're going, partner?
we got work to do.

## are you gonna let me in on this thing or what?
i'm starting to realize i have more enemies than i thought.

## what can i say?
i get hungry.

## anybody home?
ray, i am not jumping in there with you.

## what is it?
looks like he was beaten, thrown in the hot tub, and he's got the burn on the hand.

## anything to indicate that she might have killed these men?
no, of course not.

## intimate?
yes.

## do you think it's possible to do things behind your own back?
maybe i drink too much.

## what is it you think you've done?
there's been another murder.

## am i losing my mind?
i have violent dreams.

## to take a human life?
get away from me.

## can you tell if they're a good person?
give me a little time.

## yes?
let's say you come over to my house sunday morning.

## are you thinking about hitting me right now?
killing spree.

## what is it you think you've done?
i can hear your heart beating.

## why wouldn't i be ok?
i tried calling you.

## you know that feeling you've been having that somebody's been following you?
i'm getting that same feeling tonight.

## what are you doing, jess?
mike...

## you asked to see me?
turn and face that wall.

## you know a couple of victims, so you just let yourself fall to pieces, is that it?
i think i'm losing it, john.

## what the fuck, jimmy?
jimmy, just go home.

## we're gonna rumble?
open the fucking door, jessica.

## jessica shepard?
chip marshall, sld.

## where were you the night of september 25th, the night bob sherman was killed?
i don't know.

## the night of october 1 st, the night lawrence geber was murdered?
i don't know.

## the night of october 5th, the night ray porter was killed?
i don't...... know.

## jessica, did you kill these men?
i don't...

## have you given her any medication?
no, i've given her nothing.

## what's in her bloodstream?
report from forensics.

## ever heard of it?
yeah, of course.

## what do they have in common?
just me.

## whose job is it to know where you are at all times in case he might have to call you at any hour of the day or night?
no, you're off on that.

## didn't this start when you got the new job, when you met him?
it's not mike.

## do you think he'd let you prowl without following you?
there were times when i felt like i was being followed.

## where?
the night she picked up a man in a bar.

## what do you mean?
i was there.

## how could you be so sure?
hey, jess.

## what are you talking about?
partners tell each other the truth.

## you didn't get my message?
oh, god.

## excuse me, can i help you with something over there?
looks like you were having some wine before we got here, mike.

## you celebrating something?
no, i'm not celebrating anything.

## what the fuck is going on here?
i'd like to propose a toast.

## what?
to jessica.

## you got a problem with that, mike?
no.

## you gonna toast or what?
here's to my partner.

## rohypnol?
yeah, rohypnol.

## what?
date rape drug.

## you ever heard of it?
of course i've heard of it.

## that's what you hip guys call it, right?
i seem to remember you had a little girlfriend who od'd and died from this stuff.

## what the fuck is going on here?
somebody has been following me since these murders began.

## how?
somebody who was lurking around.

## any anxiety?
you put something in my wine.

## stash?
a little of this stuff must go a long way.

## this is one of those...
you plan on date raping a whole sorority house here?

## what do you call it?
a yawara.

## you didn't care too much for him, did you?
i seem to remember you threatened to kill the poor bastard.

## that always works too.
you're not going for your gun, are you, mike?

## what are you doing?
tomorrow...... when those crime scene boys show up...

## what?
put your hands behind your head, and get on your knees.

## you ever heard that old saying,
give me the gun, jess.

## don't you understand, darling?
they weren't good enough for you and her.

## you cured my mother by killing her?
she was ruining my life.

## stop?
i stopped for all those years, and i can stop again.

## recognize the voice of officer wilson, my old patrol partner?
go along with the program, sir.

## you ok?
it's cold out here, kids.

## see us?
right here in front of the dock.

## mike?
i'm so sorry.

## what's this?
well...

## what is this?
it's my gun.

## your gun?
don't hurt me.

## what?

## who wants a beer?

## right before the convention.
communist tart?

sometimes i think you came to us from another century.

## jocelyn jordan, senator jordan's daughter?

## raymond, dear.
what are you supposed to be?

## why do you always look as if your head is about to come to a point?
now, just be patient.

## raymond, why don't we just sneak away for a few minutes, sit down somewhere quietly and have a drink?
mother...

## who's in there with you, anyway?
raymond.

## hurry it up, will you?

this is my friend, major ben marco.

## how do you do, major?

## or at least kiss the bride?

well, i just made one.

## what did he mean, the queen of diamonds?

nurse hendricks is going to serve pudding pops.

## won't that be nice?
very nice.

## what's that?
to meet the big cheese.

because the people running this place... are really the crazy ones.

## what's going on with these?
put them in a cup, polly.

## i'm sorry?

## drake, are you still here?
i could use help.

## take your pills if you want to get better.
once again, alice... are you going to do what your caretaker is requesting of you?

## doesn't that make sense, sweetheart?
i'm going to ask that you take your medication... or i'm afraid i'll have to resort to disciplinary measures.

## it's late for you, isn't it?
it wants me to go to sleep now.

## why don't you come out?
hey, kid, come on.

## dr. morton, how long have you worked here?
i've worked here for 27 years.

## that were you doing down there after hours?
i followed the little boy.

## that noise i keep hearing, what is that?
it sounds like it comes from the basement.

## i figured it was the water pipes?
maybe.

## well, what is it?
it's an old building.

## what do you mean?
a while back... we had a patient down in cell 44.

## what happened?
he jumped out a third story window.

## did he die?
some say he died when he hit the ground.

## you believe that?
either that or he came back to run this place.

## if you're not too busy, perhaps you could mop it up?
sure.

## and?
and i got to the rec room and realized she didn't need help... being that she was using a taser on a patient.

## are you aware there are children running around here at night?
no one gets in or out without my authorization.

## what about the patient that escaped from the basement?
dr. morton told me about... a patient who escaped.

## look, let's start over again, all right?
while it's no secret this place could use fixing up... most of the patients housed here are content.

## you know why?
they have no place else to go.

## are we in agreement, mr. stevens?
fine.

## what are you trying to pull here?
i have no idea what you're talking about.

## what are you doing?
i'm on my way back to my room.

## do you want to sit in on an obsessive compulsive group... at 3:30?
it's my own little session.

## why, what's wrong?
nothing.

## i'm a dork?
you're a dork.

## everyone in bed?
all tucked in.

## i don't have time to waste and i don't want to hurt you.
is there something we can help you with?

## who are you?
you are only hurting yourself.

## dr. morton?
get dr. shores, take the west wing.

## did you see anyone?
we heard someone in the hall... and she went to check it out.

## tight as a drum.
they think a patient did it?

## are you dating sara?
i'll teach this freak to show respect.

## why won't you talk to me?
it might help you sort things out.

## how does it feel to be convinced something is there... when logic tells you it's not?
i thought i was hearing things.

## why are you sitting in the dark?
lilumination only reminds me of what i've become.

## what's your name?
that's a subjective question.

## how so?
bad things going down here.

## what kind of bad things?
take that sick individual lurking around, for instance.

## who do you think it is?
you're a smart boy, you'll figure it out.

## is it you?
the top of the food chain would be a good place to start looking.

## are you speaking of dr. franks?
they're cell numbers on a prescription to me.

## can you tell me what the patient in cell 44 was diagnosed with?
i just keep them doped up.

## do you know what medication he's on?
you sure have a lot of questions.

## have you seen the place?
thank you, grace.

## what's that?
taking what the patients say seriously.

## why are all the patients in the basement... on the same medication?
because i'm sure they're keeping them seriously tranquilized.

## how so?
i started seeing stuff.

## what makes you feel scared?
it won't stop scaring me.

## what won't?
i try to close my eyes, make it go away.

## what ghost?
the one that runs through the house at night.

## what does it want from you?
to make sure that i never forget what madness feels like.

## did i awake you?
not at all.

## why did you stop talking to me last time i was down here?
i'd run out of things to say.

## why don't you come into the light where i can see you?
come on, we're friends by now.

## can you get out of this cell?
only if someone lets me.

## now who's talking in circles?
clark, i've got sara on line one out here.

## we'll continue this conversation later?
you can call me ben.

## what will the patients say?
i think it's a little late for that.

## so, did you finish up your interviews?
basically.

## what are you taking?
oh, i have a cold.

## what are you doing?
i'm sorry.

## why you taking risperdex?
here goes.

## still want to be my friend?
sure.

## you're all right now?
yeah, yeah, i'm fine.

## so?
i was bringing in the games.

## did you see him talking to anyone before he came in?
he went out to get his medication.

## was carl just here?
half hour ago.

## other than himself?
no.

## what did you give him?
what i always do.

## are we starting with q& a again?
because i don't have time.

## grace, i'm sorry, what did you give him?
i gave him his usual dose of happy tabs.

## does it help?
i wouldn't know.

## but, ben, why don't you take it?
they wouldn't help me if i did.

## why not?
a hospital is a place of business.

## they give patients weak medication to keep them sick?
look around you.

## did i say something happened to him?
i can't believe you talked me into this.

## why are we doing this?
i'll send the pills to a friend who works at the university hospital.

## what?
you're cute when you're sleuthing.

## sara?
there is no place like home.

## you're sure he isn't?
no way.

## what?
it's just between your theories on the medication, and franks.

## now you're seeing ghosts?
maybe your surroundings are affecting you.

## where do they keep the patient records?
come on.

## what happened?
franks found her taser in his things.

## clark, you're there?
i'm sorry, yes, this is he.

## what?
just placebos.

## taking matters into our own hands?
very aggressive.

## how do you know about everything going on here?
i'm smart.

## why do you get out and i don't?
only in my mind, royce.

## how many?
none.

## none?
this is unbelievable.

## so?
so he's not dead.

## what are you thinking?
i don't know.

## pickles?
it's clark.

## what's happening to me?
it's okay.

## do you remember?
look, i think you forgot to take your medication.

## what happened?
thank god you're okay.

## what?
i'm scared.

## what?
i heard it on the radio.

## it isn't drake.
what?

## what are you talking about?
i asked the cops and they said he was arrested 20 minutes ago.

## what if something happened in the building... and it's never forgotten?
clark... it was a person.

## clark, are you there?
right in front of your eyes.

## why did you drug me?
i just gave you a calmative.

## who?
cell 44.

## why didn't you tell me it was sara?
i'm going to let you out of here.

## that kid i keep seeing running around the halls?
it's a little strange that he runs around here at night.

## ls this true?
thats right.

## hows everything going?
good afternoon, mr. amer.

## does this ever cause you any lack of confidence?
let me put it this way, mr. amer.

## hal, despite your enormous intellect, are you ever frustrated...... by your dependence on people to carry out actions?
not in the slightest bit.

## dr. poole, whats it like living for the better part of a year...... in such close proximity with hal?
lts pretty close to what you said about him earlier.

## do you believe that hal has genuine emotions?
oh, yes.

## what is it, hal?
weve got the transmission from your parents coming in.

## looks great, doesnt it?
sorry you cant be with us.

## but something was definitely chewing on her... after she was dumped here.
you know we were on television last week?

## sam, what do we got here?
i'd say we got ourselves a homicide.

## see that blood?
it was smeared on.

## you don't think it was one of those voodoo things, do you?
no, the chicken blood's there to attract pigs.

## you know what killed her?
probably blunt force trauma, judging by the cranial bruising.

## what for?
they pulled what was left of a body out of the swamp down there.

## listen, chief, how about i stay here?
send abrams down, grab a few photos...

## not a pretty sight, is it?
looks like he's been in the water for 48 hours, give or take.

## you know anything about this guy?
not a lot.

## did you put a verdict down on the cause of death yet?
alligator attack.

## then why call in an me?
because these don't look like any gator bites i've ever seen before.

## where'd they find the body?
way out in the deep swamp.

## you got a phone around here?
sure.

## you sam rivers?
that would be me.

## you the biologist?
mary callahan.

## so, you ready?
yeah, let's do it.

## water?
no, i've got some cold ones in the cooler, if you want.

## you get a lot of swamp murders?
no, not really.

## you want to take a look at some photos of the body... and tell me what you think?
yeah, sure.

## is that your professional opinion?
it's extremely unlikely that an alligator could have done this.

## but we're a little too far upriver for a great white, aren't we?
yeah, but not for a bull shark.

## you think a boat propeller could have done that?
no boat this big could have traveled that far up the bayou.

## well, what do you think happened then?
probably some redneck poacher's idea of a joke.

## is he okay?
watch.

## is it biting you?
hell, yeah.

## some strange fella stick his hand in your hole, wouldn't you bite him?
this is like the dark side of hee haw.

## what y'all want with old john?
john's dead.

## y'all cops?
my name's sam rivers.

## fisting a catfish?
well, i don't know what happened to john.

## god, who would want to live so far away from everything?
hey, pardner, pull up over there.

## whose houseboat is that?
that's my niece and her naked husband.

## and who lives in those?
that house over there on the left, that's ricardo's.

## either of you have any ideas of what happened to mr. crankton?
we feel real sad about what happened to john.

## now, ricardo, he's the one that found the body, right?
he doesn't talk much.

## how about gloria?
well, come on, we'll see.

## i hate to bother you, but is your mama in the house?
yeah, she's in there.

## you want to come in?
eliza, your mother will not let me pack up the shrine.

## dan, if she doesn't want to move the altar, can we just leave it there?
that's fine, i just...

## just the two of you?
damn fool.

## this boat, can you show it to us?
no, i can't go there.

## what is this thing?
it's just some crazy old voodoo stuff.

## y'all want some fruit?
no, thanks.

## guess not, huh?
got no shame, them two.

## what's a boat that size doing way up in the swamp?
i have no idea.

## you've been on it before?
no.

## how long has this thing been here?
about three months.

## not even to look for something worth taking?
no.

## did john crankton go aboard?
never said he did.

## what is that smell?
something's rotten.

## you all right?
yeah.

## what?
nothing.

## you okay?
yeah.

## what is this?
my god, look at this.

## what is this?
it's a fish scale.

## elmer, you okay?
yeah.

## what was that?
i don't know.

## where is it?
it's about 50 miles downriver.

## so, what happened?
we have no idea.

## well, what about the cargo?
don't know.

## none of your great white hunter bullshit, okay?
let me get someone in there to check it out and take care of things.

## you got that?
yeah.

## so, you're saying there's a swamp monster out here killing people?
look, the only thing that's out there are things that belong there.

## look, are we safe here?
that boat is about three miles away from here.

## bother us?
it killed my dad.

## and what's with all the equipment?
anton, meet ben.

## how are you?
we've already been on a couple of hunts together.

## what are we dealing with?
well, it's clearly carnivorous... which right there, narrows it down to about four or five fish on the planet.

## how the hell did it get so big?
it's the bayou.

## isn't he afraid of whatever is out there?
ricardo ain't scared of anything.

## sam?
no thanks.

## snapping turtle?
why, yes.

## where did you say you were from again?
well, actually i grew up around here, in otley.

## you didn't happen to go to bienvenu high, did you?
yeah, i did.

## is this the boy you told me about?
no, mother.

## really?
oh, yeah.

## that comment's about me, isn't it?
that's just lovely.

## would you guys excuse us for a minute, please?
excuse me.

## look, i'm sorry, okay?
dan, i didn't ask for your help.

## why do you put up with him?
because i'm a paralegal in his office.

## who says i'm talking about a guy?
but, you know, it's funny.

## sam, what you drinking?
just some tea your mother made me.

## what kind of tea, ma?
just an old family recipe.

## what the hell?
honey, i think i see something.

## roland, what is it?
he was near the water...

## did you see that fucking thing?
now we know what could decapitate a 12 foot alligator.

## did you see what it just did to bobbi?
give me the keys.

## what about ricardo?
he won't go.

## did john have a gun?
no, it's gone.

## does it still run?
i don't know.

## you sure you want to do this?
yeah.

## eliza, are you all right?
it should be dead by now.

## really?
well, it's not.

## ricardo?
you killed that thing.

## what are you doing?
that thing ate bobbi.

## what smells delicious?
oh, fuck.

## how the fuck can it do that?
it must have a vestigial air lung.

## you got it?
yeah.

## nothing?
what we want ain't here.

## what about our mules?
they're here, all right.

## what the hell are we going to do?
wait.

## what the hell was that?
let's go, boys.

## really?
fuck me.

## hey, can you hold yourself?
i just want to see if i can look inside ricardo's.

## no, what are you talking about?
it'll be okay.

## what the hell was that?
you've got to swim.

## tell me, how many are there?
we don't know.

## what are those things?
they're genetically engineered northern snakeheads.

## explain to me, why would you do that?
yeah, i got it.

## excuse me?
i want to go home.

## but once y'all get aboard my boat... you do what i say, you understand?
shut up, dan.

## now what?
now we go get it.

## you know what?
i'm going to have my hands full holding this gun.

## how many?
god damn it, ben.

## did you see how big that female was?
the male could be 25 feet long.

## what's he talking about?
nothing, keep going.

## wait, what are you doing?
there it is.

## are you saying there's another one?
i'm trying to start this engine so we can go get sam... and leave those two assholes to their monster.

## yeah?
yeah.

## yeah?
well, it's not too far of a swim.

## thank your mom for all the cookies, ok?
i'm very proud of you.

## a... a princess?
shut up.

## is that scary or what?
well, maybe fat louie can give me some help.

## have you met the princess yet?

## is this an american custom?

we are learning the art of the fan.

## are you sassing your grandma?
i would never sass you, grandma.

## may i?
of course.

## yeah?
a princess never chases a chicken.

## did you come up with this on your own?
oh, no, it's a centuries old idea.

## our ancestors knew a thing or two, right?
you just drape your skirt over it and nobody suspects a thing.

## so let's get it really spooked, shall we?
this is a fake snake.

## what do you want?
just think, mia.

## so just this once, can you please let me be miserable, and not make me feel worse about myself?
just go away.

## am i going to be disappointed in you?
unfortunate incident, that.

## you going to come and see me off?
i'd like to speak with your uncle alone, nicholas.

## why are you so against princess mia being queen?
well, my uncle feels that princess mia doesn't know the people.

## and you feel you do know the people?
yes.

## you do?
yes.

## how can one rule the people if they do not know the people?
touch.

## how are your grandchildren, lily, charlotte and sam?
they're wonderful.

## how are you?
good to see you.

## maury, right?
he is great.

## you remember him from last summer?
mia's doing well.

## who?
the king wannabe with lady elissa.

## is she his... girlfriend?
nicholas doesn't have girlfriends, he has dates.

## you talk to him much?
uh...

## andrew?
yes, dear.

## what?
just one more, please.

## why not brag?
you're an amazing woman.

## oh, really?
that's wonderful.

## really?
andrew spent four months in papua new guinea studying the bark of a yam tree.

## andrew, would you like to get a drink?
i would absolutely love to.

## oh, really?
yes...

## understands you?
wow.

## why would i be jealous of andrew?
he's got to spend the rest of his life married to you.

## what is wrong with you?
you can't just go around kissing people.

## you want to kiss again?
well, i...

## what's confusing about a kiss?
you're just trying to make me like you so that i won't want to marry andrew and so that you can have the crown.

## you know what?
i have an idea.

## why don't you go underwater and i'll count to a million?
mia, careful...

## do i want to know?
i don't think so.

## she's going to be a handful, isn't she?
you'll never be bored, andrew.

## do you think i plan for this kind of stuff to happen?
i lost it.

## can you try to grasp that concept?
the concept is grasped.

## or are you upset with me too?
royal guard of genovia, fall in.

## why do you talk like that?
i'm captain kip kelly of the royal guard.

## what if we all talked like that?
that was very nicely done, miss lilly.

## flag?
thank you.

## flag?
welcome.

## may i offer you a flag?
thank you, i am not a waving aficionado.

## how do you feel today, my dear?
honestly, joe, not that great.

## well, would you feel better if you called me joey?
no, joe.

## mia?
she's stopped the parade.

## what's the princess going to do now?
she's walking towards the children's shelter.

## would you like to be a princess today?
i can't, i'm too little.

## give them all free tiaras?
i'll take care of it later.

## can we be in the parade?
of course, of course.

## so are you ready?
yes.

## everybody having fun?
yeah.

## lord crawley, how is your brother doing?
i don't speak to my brother.

## do you?

## lilly?
the princesses are arriving.

## is this my party?
no, this is princess mia's party.

## felix?
i thought you never slide.

## the song you sang at my 1 8th birthday party.
is she really going to do this?

## remember that?
go on.

## what are you saying?
well, she's smart.

## are you mad?
she believes in genovia so much that she's convinced herself to marry someone that she knows she can never love.

## after all the effort that we have put in, to end up with nothing?
it wouldn't be nothing.

## that she will leave andrew and marry you?
i put in the effort to make you a king, not to have you marry a queen.

## are you sure i didn't burn you?
of course you did.

## can i talk to you for a second?
uh huh.

## should i shoo him?
just tell me who i should shoo and i'll shoo.

## why don't you go introduce lilly to your parents?
you know, just tell them i'll be up for brunch in a second.

## would you please try to keep up, brigitta?
he's trying to steal the crown.

## ready?
mm hm.

## gretchen, what bike?
we don't have a bike.

## oh, how do you do, seor?
oh, he needs my horse.

outspoken american activist lilly moscovitz, the maid of honor, glides forward as a vision in pink.

## will anyone second my motion?
keep eye contact with them.

## hm?
the princess would like a word.

## grandma?
just because i didn't get my fairy tale ending, doesn't mean you shouldn't.

## did you hear that?
not if you didn't want me to.

## joseph?
your majesty.

## am i too late... to ask you to accept my hand in marriage?
well, i thought you'd never ask.

## shades?
you're in charge now.

## what did i miss?
she's not getting married.

## she's not getting married?
no.

## the queen's getting married?
yeah, to joe.

## think i'll make a good queen?

## what is your dilemma, young man?
you are, in fact.

## do you have a chicken for my table?
no.

a great pillar of spores.

## see?
be a good child.

## kai and kui.
you were only scared, weren't you?

## do you remember me?
such a mysterious power.

## father can't fly anymore.
are you tired?

## the forest's poison?
it's master yupa.

## reminds me of nausicaa when she was young.
okay, toeto?

## would you please be this child's godfather?
so that a good wind will always blow for her.

## saved by this child?
this valley is good.

## how were your travels this time?
it's terrible.

## why can't they live like you in this valley?
it's because here we are protected by the blessed wind that blows from the sea.

## why don't you settle in this valley soon?
i'm in this condition.

## destined, you say?
my, my...

## you didn't know, nausicaa?
there it's in that tapestry on the wall.

## same thing, isn't it?
i only want to solve the riddle of the wastelands.

## are we, the human race, destined to be swallowed by the wastelands and be destroyed?
goll says he smells something in the wind.

## it's almost dawn, isn't it?
i'll be right there.

## it's a plane.
why would a plane be in a borderland like this?

## how could they?
they must have been in the wasteland and killed some insects.

## where?
the valley of the wind.

## the cargo?
wait.

## if even one remains, it would be a disaster.
ohmu?

## what is this thing?
it didn't burn, even in the fire.

## master yupa, what is this?
in my travels, i heard of an ominous rumor.

## a monster from the ancient world?
all the god warriors should have become fossils by now.

## what can it be?
it's a torumekian ship.

## though it may have been a small thing, is this the courtesy of torumekia towards such a country?
if you're starting a war, you should give a reason.

## aren't you yupa miralda, the best swordsman in the borderlands?
we have revived the miraculous skills and powers that once made the human race...... the masters of this planet.

## it's a pretty nice valley, don't you think?
i'm opposed to this.

## are you saying we should make that monster the play thing of those fools back home?
yes, spoils of war.

## five hostages, the gunship, and goods, you say?
i'll leave the selection of the hostages up to you.

## teto, where is your mistress?
nausicaa.

## what is the meaning of this?
these are plants from the wasteland.

## why?
even this venomous hisokusari plant has flowered.

## you found that out all by yourself?
yes.

## have i ever lied to you?
no.

## have i?
no.

## see?
my butt is killing me.

## why are they in such a tight formation?
the engine noise is a hindrance.

## did you think i would get on my knees and thank you?
the ohmu's eyes are bright red.

## princess what do you think you're doing with mehve?
when the water calms down, take off at once and wait up in the air.

## where are we going?
no, go home, boy.

## now, who's with me?
i am, wallace.

## where do you think you're going?
i'm going with you.

## and what are you going to do?
i'm going to help.

## da?
william.

## you didn't want your father to die either, did you?
but it happened.

## did the priest give a poetic benediction?
it was in latin.

## well, that's something we shall have to remedy, isn't it?
the lord bless thee and keep thee.

## what are they doing?
saying good bye in their own way playing outlawed tunes on outlawed pipes.

## where is my son?
your pardon, milord.

## shall i leave, milord?
if he wants his queen to rule when i am gone, then, by all means, stay and learn how.

## are they?
the trouble with scotland is that it's full ofscots.

## that should fetch just the kind of lords we want to scotland, taxes or no taxes, huh?
a most excellent idea, sire.

## is it?
now in edinburgh ga thered the council of scottish nobles.

## and how is your father?
mm hmm.

## could you crush a man with that throw?
aye.

## would you like to see him crush me like a worm?
come do it.

## are you all right?
you look a wee bit shaky.

## william... will you dance with me?
of course i will.

## grand softevening, huh?
aye, it's that.

## what do you want to have a word about?
well, um...

## in this?
you're out of your mind.

## no the now?
we'll see you later.

## did you not hear what i said?
murron get oh.

## how could you know me after so long?
well, i didn't.

## are you in the habit of riding off in the rain with strangers?
it was the best way to make you leave.

## can you not?
no.

## well, that's something we shall have to remedy, isn't it?
you're going to teach me to read, then? if you like.

## in what language?
you're showing off now.

## are you impressed yet?
no.

## why should i be?
do that standing on your head, and i'll be impressed.

## you've been to rome?
aye.

## what does that mean?
beautiful.

## murron?
come in now.

## what kind of meeting?
the secret kind.

## you say you want to stay out ofthe troubles?
if you can prove it, you may court my daughter.

## no?
no, wallace.

## of course, running a farm's a lot ofwork, but that will all change when my sons arrive.
didn't i just prove it?

## so you've got children?
oh, not yet, but i was hoping that you could help me with that.

## so you want me to marry you, then?
well, it's a bit sudden, but all right.

## is that what you call a proposal?
i love you.

## it is?
we best hurry.

## what's that?
you'll see.

## tonight?
i can't.

## when?
tonight.

## where are you going, lassie?
come on.

## are you all right?
aye.

## can you ride?
actually, it was more like 50.

## you remember me?
i never did her any harm.

## this wallace is a brigand, nothing more.
your right?

## and how would you deal with this brigand?
like any common thief.

## you're out numbered and trapped.
understood?

## father?
oh, come in.

## under whom?
a commoner... named william wallace.

## and you wish to charge off and fight as he did, eh?
so would l.

## so what do we do?
hit, run, hide, the highland way.

## that long?
aye.

## him?
that can't be william wallace.

## is your father a ghost, or do you converse with the almighty?
to find his equal, an lrishman talks to god.

## you mean lreland?
i didn't like him anyway.

## do the nobles rally?
robert the bruce and most ofthe others will not commit to battle, but word has spread, and the highlanders are coming down on their own.

## what news?
we're outnumbered, at least three to one.

## how many horse?
300.

## 300 heavy horse?
we must negotiate.

## did he have a scarlet chevron?
aye, he did.

## what are they talking about?
i can't hear, but it does not look good.

## tojoin it, you give homage.
where is thy salute?

## and free men you are.
i give homage to scotland, and ifthis isyo ur army... why does it go?

## run, and you'll live... at least awhile.
what will you do with that freedom?

## i think we should deliver the king's terms.
albagu bra!

## the king's terms?
he'll never live up to them.

## shall we go and meet them?
let me do the talking.

## now what do we do?
just be yourselves.

## where are you going?
i'm going to pick a fight.

## from his king?
absolutely.

## does anyone know his politics?
no, but his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything.

## wait sir william, where are you going?
we have beaten the english, but they'll come back because you won't stand together.

## what will you do?
i will invade england and defeat the english on their own ground.

## ha ha ha lnvade?
that's impossible.

## why is that impossible?
there's a difference between us.

## the common man that bleeds on the battlefield does he risk less?
no... but from top to bottom, this country has got no sense of itself.

## we need them?
aye.

## tell me, what does that mean to be noble?
to here, milord.

## what news ofthe north?
nothing new, your majesty.

## what?
wallace has sacked york.

## what beast could do such a thing?
i have declared phillip my high counselor.

## is he qualified?
i am skilled in the arts ofwar and military tactics, sire.

## i shall offer a truce... and buy him off.
are you?

## but who will go to him?
not l.

## whom do i send?
i'm dreaming.

## to do what?
to discuss the king's proposals.

## will you speak with a woman?
i understand you have recently been given the rank of knight.

## the executioner ofthe king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
well, longshanks did far worse the last time he took a scottish city.

## longshanks desires peace?
he declares it to me.

## a lordship and titles... gold... that i should become judas?
peace is made in such ways.

## so he accepted our bribe?
no, he did not.

## then why does he stay?
my scouts tell me that he has not advanced.

## did he?
the welsh bowmen will not be detected arriving so far around his flank.

## lrish conscripts?
even if you dispatch them today, they'd take weeks to assemble.

## tell me... what kind of man is he?
a mindless barbarian.

## why are the lrish fighting with the english?
i wouldn't worry about them.

## didn't i tell you before?
it's my island.

## you said yourself the nobles will not support wallace.
other options?

## so how did it help us tojoin the side that is slaughtered?
i gave him my word.

## wouldn't you agree?
the archers are ready, sire.

## lochlan?
i gave mornay double his lands in scotland and matching estates in england.

## won't we hit our own troops?
yes... but we'll hit theirs as well.

## shall we retire?
protect the king.

## nothing?
aye.

## why?
there will be a new shipment ofsupplies coming north next month foods and weapons.

## why do you help me?
because ofthe way you are looking at me now.

## well, what's the point?
you've all sworn loyalty to longshanks.

## one?
you mean us and you.

## it's a trap.
what about the others?

## are you blind?
look at us.

## what?
nothing.

## do you?
aye, i do.

## a dream?
just a...

## well, then what have we been doing all this time?
we've lived that dream.

## shall i come with you?
longshanks acquired wallace.

## against whom?
against your king.

## have you anything to say?
never in my whole life... did i swear allegiance to him.

## do you confess?
then on the morrow, you shall receive your purification.

## who do you think will rule this kingdom?
now open this door.

## will he show mercy to my country?
mercy is to die quickly, perhaps even live in a tower.

## in time, who knows what can happen... if you can only live?
if i swear to him, then all that i am is dead already.

## you're quite taken with him, aren't you?
rise to your knees, kiss the royal emblem on my cloak, and you will feel no more.

## enough?
ohh.

## does anyone know his politics?
no, but his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything.

## wait sir william, where are you going?
we have beaten the english, but they'll come back because you won't stand together.

## what will you do?
i will invade england and defeat the english on their own ground.

## ha ha ha invade?
that's impossible.

## why is that impossible?
there's a difference between us.

## the common man that bleeds on the battlefield does he risk less?
no... but from top to bottom, this country has got no sense of itself.

## we need them?
aye.

## tell me, what does that mean to be noble?
to here, my lord.

## what news of the north?
nothing new, your majesty.

## what?
wallace has sacked york.

## what beast could do such a thing?
i have declared phillip my high counselor.

## is he qualified?
i am skilled in the arts of war and military tactics, sire.

## then tell me... what advice would you offer on the, uh, present, uh, situation?
i shall offer a truce... and buy him off.

## but who will go to him?
not i.

## whom do i send?
i'm dreaming.

## to do what?
to discuss the king's proposals.

## will you speak with a woman?
i understand you have recently been given the rank of knight.

## the executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
well, longshanks did far worse the last time he took a scottish city.

## longshanks desires peace?
he declares it to me.

## a lordship and titles... gold... that i should become judas?
peace is made in such ways.

## so he accepted our bribe?
no, he did not.

## then why does he stay?
my scouts tell me that he has not advanced.

## did he?
the welsh bowmen will not be detected arriving so far around his flank.

## irish conscripts?
even if you dispatch them today, they'd take weeks to assemble.

## tell me... what kind of man is he?
a mindless barbarian.

## why are the irish fighting with the english?
i wouldn't worry about them.

## didn't i tell you before?
it's my island.

## you said yourself the nobles will not support wallace.
other options?

## so how did it help us to join the side that is slaughtered?
i gave him my word.

## wouldn't you agree?
the archers are ready, sire.

## lochlan?
i gave mornay double his lands in scotland and matching estates in england.

## won't we hit our own troops?
yes... but we'll hit theirs as well.

## shall we retire?
protect the king.

## nothing?
aye.

## why?
there will be a new shipment of supplies coming north next month foods and weapons.

## why do you help me?
because of the way you are looking at me now.

## well, what's the point?
you've all sworn loyalty to longshanks.

## one?
you mean us and you.

## it's a trap.
what about the others?

## are you blind?
look at us.

## what?
nothing.

## do you?
aye, i do.

## a dream?
just a...

## well, then what have we been doing all this time?
we've lived that dream.

## shall i come with you?
longshanks acquired wallace.

## against whom?
against your king.

## have you anything to say?
never in my whole life... did i swear allegiance to him.

## do you confess?
then on the morrow, you shall receive your purification.

## who do you think will rule this kingdom?
now open this door.

## will he show mercy to my country?
mercy is to die quickly, perhaps even live in a tower.

## in time, who knows what can happen... if you can only live?
if i swear to him, then all that i am is dead already.

## you're quite taken with him, aren't you?
hds, sir.

## how are you this afternoon?
alrighty.

## do you mind if i pet him?
i don't give a rat's ass.

## unfortunately...... in every contest there must be a loser.
what's the matter with you?

## hungry, fellow?
there you go.

## you missed mommy, didn't you?
yes, you did.

## did daddy hurt you?
i won't let him.

## how can i ever repay you?
a reward would be good.

## yes, satan?
i'm sorry, sir.

## what's all this pet food for?
fiber.

## are you satisfied?
just don't let me catch you with an animal in here.

## what?
i'm sorry, i was just going to say...... that it's not a fish.

## have they called back?
no, but i wanted to tell you, when i lost my cuddles...... i hired a pet detective.

## a what?
a pet detective.

## any trouble getting in?
no, the guy with the rubber glove was surprisingly gentle.

## why don't you have a seat?
i'll get right to the point.

## are you familiar with snowflake?
i don't smoke.

## roger, how you holding up?
if i'm walking funny it's because i got two dozen reporters up my ass.

## who's he?
roger podacter, meet ace ventura.

## she was half dead when i found her.
martha mertz?

## is that the tank?
excuse me.

## cops drain it?
snowflake is not available right now.

## or were they leashes?
homicide, ventura.

## ace, please.
how are you gonna solve that one?

## now you've pissed him off.
what's that matter?

## we checked out the taxidermists and we already checked on van rentals.
would you give me a break?

## what'd you find out about the tank?
nothing.

## that's it?
i swear.

## now will you please get out of here before i get in trouble?
thank you for your cooperation.

## what the hell is he doing here?
i came to confess.

## may i suggest you yield to the experts on this one?
we'll find the porpoise.

## listen, pet dick...... how would you like me to make your life a living hell?
well, i'm not really ready for a relationship, lois.

## excuse me.
your number still 911?

## what's the password?
new england clam chowder.

## hey, saint francis, how's it going?
super, thanks for asking.

## so what are you up to?
just watching the fishies.

## you see those blips?
of course i can.

## why?
i wanna trace the sale of equipment...... for transporting or housing a dolphin recently.

## the billionaire?
billionaire and rare fish collector.

## really?
that is the face of the enemy.

## camp is connected with the dolphins?
that subgenius gave them the land the stadium's built on.

## like this?
hi, captain stubing.

## how are gopher and doc?
permission to come aboard, sir.

## and who is he, a friend?
no, this is...

## how is everybody feeling tonight?
very, very well, thank you.

## are you insane?
there is no way that camp stole snowflake.

## smooshy, isn't it?
we got a few cases from my new dealer in paris.

## they're wonderful, aren't they?
it's been an awfully long time.

## who, tom?
well, i'm sure he's fine.

## what're you doing?
i'm sorry, ron.

## and it's not a pebble, it's a rare, triangular cut orange amber.
what's he doing?

## what're you talking about?
tonight i saw the same stone in camp's ring.

## what ring?
the 1984 dolphin afc championship ring.

## how you gonna do that?
simple.

## over half a million members worldwide?
no.

## what do you feed your dog?
dog food.

## what are you talking about?
he's very unhappy.

## yeah?
and you're ugly.

## hiring you was the biggest mistake i ever made.
would you please leave?

## you like her, huh?
yeah, she's all right.

## you okay?
i told you.

## have a bad night?
so...... animals can sense evil.

## who let dr. doolittle in?
lieutenant, he came with miss robinson.

## so...... you don't think this is an obvious suicide, mr. pet detective?
i wouldn't say that.

## she said she heard a scream.
may i tell you what i think happened?

## and you had to open the balcony door when you came in?
that's true.

## you're sure you had to open this door?
i'm certain.

## what's the point, ventura?
only this.

## back to the zoo.
can you feel that, buddy?

## what are you thinking?
this whole thing is connected, somehow.

## what about receipts?
there's gotta be receipts.

## wanna hear something spooky?
sure.

## want to know why i do this?
i'm not sure anymore.

## are these all?
there's only a dozen.

## what?
that.

## who the hell is that?
that's ray finkle, the kicker.

## why isn't he in this picture?
this was taken earlier in the year.

## but he got himself a ring, didn't he?
definitely.

## where is he now?
i heard he went back to his hometown in collier county.

## you're gonna drop me off before you go?
no way.

## oh, my god.
what do you suggest?

## three times?
i'm sorry, that's never happened to me before.

## what do you know about ray finkle?
soccer style kicker.

## are you another one of them hard copy guys?
no, sir.

the boy is a fan of our son.

## are you expecting ray anytime soon?

i just baked them.

## what do you know?
i'm in psychoville, and finkle's the mayor.

## why?
there's no communication with the kidnappers.

## will the super bowl be postponed?
the game is on as scheduled.

## why weren't we told about the kidnapping?
secrecy was essential.

## are the crimes related?
i just wanna know how much time i have.

## you ever heard of a former dolphin kicker named ray finkle?
all right, ventura...... make it quick.

## so how does roger podacter fit in?
my guess is, finkle was snooping around.

## so where is finkle now?
busted out of a mental institute.

## i'm sorry, could you speak into my good ear?
i thought i heard you call me ace.

## want me to read you your rights?
maybe later.

## that bony little bitch...... melissa robinson?
i heard some commotion.

## why don't you throw yourself out?
it's the middle of the night.

## now who is it you want us to look at?
my brother...... larry.

## is that right?
yes, we're very sensitive...... to the stress athletes have to endure.

## has he had a history of mental illness?
as long as i've known him.

## what do you want?
i don't have any food for you.

## do you see a dolphin here?
let's face it...... your master is a loser.

## what the...?
that's it.

## aren't you having fun?
i just love super bowl sunday.

## don't you, dan?
a magical afternoon...... where dreams are made...... and crushed.

## does it seem as if we've...... met someplace before?
i don't know.

## would you like some refreshments, dan?

well team...

## and do you know why?

i have an urgent need to expand my humanitarian program.

## where were you tonight, max?
i've been home, writing my vows.

## and how exactly are you gonna do that?
i'm a thief.

## why can't we just be two cops working a case?
hey, i happen to agree with you.

## how about a steam?
what...

## okay, you wanna go for a jacuzzi, partner?
i have a big tub in my room.

## can we just do this one on one?
oh, of course.

it never rains here.

## five minutes?
you should be embarrassed.

## a quick two?
oh, don't worry, i'm quick.

## where'd he go?
over there.

## what's wrong?
nothing.

## nothing's wrong?
me and sophie hooked up.

## why is that?
because the ship's only gonna be here 24 more hours, and you're gonna clip napoleon ill and make me look like a jerk again.

## luc, you're not working tonight, right?
give us a hand here.

## i'll sit down right now and write my vows, okay?
the vows are not for me, they're for you.

## wouldn't it be good if it was true?
think what we could do.

## but where have they gone?
corfu.

## corf corfu?
but that's impossible.

## why on earth would they go to corfu?
well, they probably knew that i was onto them.

## what did your master steal for the conte?
we may be young, but we're not completely stupid.

## well, you don't think the conte could keep the merry go round secret in the city, do you?
and another thing.

## well, what on earth is that?
here.

## 15?
with this money, i can be any age i want.

## nature will soon grant him his wish.
did you hear that, renzo?

## uh, how much does it cost to go to the dentist?
looks like it's all here.

## look who it is.
i wonder where my walking, talking little reward is?

## did you really think you were going to get away?
if we go on like this, we'll be as stiff as frozen chickens.

morning.

## don't i know you?

aha, so that is your name.

## who is it?
your godmother.

## do you know what?
i reckon she's got a crush on you.

## how did you know we were at ida's?

prosper and i want to ride the merry go round forward.

## are you expecting visitors?
no one dares to set foot on this island.

## does he know about that merry go round?
good heavens, no.

## but what if he rode the merry go round and is now all old like you?
i don't know what funny stories you've been listening to.

## does it matter which one we ride?
the lion was the right mount for me, but to grow older... you two must choose one of the water creatures.

## the sea horse or the merman?
what you do is your choice, but i can't do this.

## what about bo?
i've never been more sure of anything in my life.

## am i bigger than my father?

balla, what do you mean?

## sia, where are you going?
do not flee.

## mind your language, okay?

## and then i can feel unique again even if it's only for like a second.
you know what i do when i feel completely unoriginal?

## so, no one's ever done that?
no, not in this spot.

## what are you, shy?
this is your one opportunity to do something... that no one has done before and that no one will copy again throughout human existence.

oh, i've done that one before.

## hmm?
wow.

## i tried, you know?
i thought of all the saddest things i could think of.

## i just focused in on it, you know?
but nothing came.

## what do you mean?
uh, sam, that's mark, dave and you remember jesse.

## what's up?
of course i can swim.

## maybe it's like this rite of passage, you know?
you won't ever have that feeling again until you create a new idea of home for yourself.

## but i miss the idea of it, you know?
maybe that's all family really is.

## where is it?
it's keeping us warm.

## why did they send you away?
oh.

## why did they send you to boarding school?
they sent me to boarding school because... they thought i might be dangerous.

## oh, are you freaked out?
you're like running for the door.

## why would they think you'd be dangerous?
you're like a little detective.

## want to know?
yeah.

## it was just a complete freak accident, you know?
it's one of those things you replay a million times in your head... and you see how clearly it was just a complete freak thing.

## wow.
yeah!

## still want to compare fucked up families?
but your mom was in the wheelchair long before you left.

## where's the sauna?

yeah.

## why are you buying knives?
i don't need knives.

## you got a receipt?
actually, no.

## why are you returning these?
they're not sharp enough.

## they're not sharp enough?
no.

## you bought them to cut cans?
no, but in the commercial, it said if i wanted to cut cans, i could.

## did you try it?
yeah.

## so, how often do you go?
i hit every employee once, and then i wait until they hire new ones.

## okay, andrew?
i make my own.

## okay?
let's go.

## what is this place?
i think you can see into the hotelrooms.

## how do you know she's a hooker?
girls who look like her do not fuck guys that look like him... unless it's for coke, money or fame.

## who the fuck are you?
this is sam.

## that thing come with balloons?
raise you hand if you just saw some titties.

## now.
hmm?

## what is it that you do down here?
well, we're calling it kiernan's fault.

## so, how deep does it go?
thank you.

## what is it that you think you're gonna find?
i guess i just like the idea of discovering something.

## but, you know what?
that's all ego.

## um, do you guys want some garbage bags or something?
good luck exploring the infinite abyss.

## don't you want to know what's in the bag?
to be honest, i don't even care anymore.

## what is it?
it's my mom's favorite necklace.

## i got it back to you, right?
that's gotta be worth something.

## this whole day was about this?
you didn't want it down there with her.

## and there was just, like, snot dripping down my nose, right?
and, uh...

## large?
i think i see one.

## that it?

this was such a good idea.

## who are you?
i'm your new friend sam.

## tissue?

maybe if i did, i could help steer us back there.

## i'm gonna forgive myself for what i did.
okay, we're here, right?

## are you ready?
i was a little boy, and somebody made a shitty latch.

## that's what i think about the whole thing, okay?
and i'm not gonna take those drugs anymore.

## i have felt so fucking numb to everything i have experienced in my life, okay?
and for that...

## that's a pretty weighty experiment to take on, don't you think?
this is my life, dad.

## you know that, right?
we may not be as happy as you always dreamed we would be, but...

## and that'll be better, okay?
i think that'll be better.

## you're not coming back, are you?

malfoy.

## is that bad?
it's bad.

## good god, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are you?
norbert's gone.

## that's good, isn't it?
he's with his own kind.

## what if the other dragons are mean to him?
he's only a baby.

## the forest?
i thought that was a joke.

## hagrid, what is that?
what we're here for.

## see that?
that's unicorn blood, that is.

## do you hear that?
harry potter, you must leave.

## what was that thing you saved me from?
a monstrous creature.

## do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?
the philosopher's stone.

## you all right there, harry?
harry potter, this is where i leave you.

## you mean, you know who is out there right now in the forest?
but he's weak.

## don't you see?
we had it wrong.

## but if he comes back...... you don't think he'll try to kill you, do you?
if he'd had the chance, he might have tried tonight.

## who's the one wizard voldemort always feared?
dumbledore.

## all right there, harry?
i never saw his face.

## was he interested in fluffy?
of course he was interested.

## how often do you come across a three headed dog?

## where are you going?
we have to see dumbledore.

## how do you know?
someone's going to try and steal it.

## now would you go back to your dormitories?
quietly.

## what would three young gryffindors...... be doing inside on a day like this?
we were just you ought to be careful.

## now what do we do?
we go down the trap door.

## you're sneaking out again, aren't you?

## ron, you okay?

## what is that?
i don't know.

## what's this all about?
i don't know.

## what will we do?
there must be a thousand keys.

## what's wrong?
it's too simple.

## where are we?
a graveyard.

## it's obvious, isn't it?
we've got to play our way across the room.

## what happens now?
well, white moves first.

## ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like...... real wizard's chess, do you?
harry, it's you that has to go on.

## me?
books and cleverness.

## you?
but that day, during the quidditch match, snape tried to kill me.

## snape was trying to save me?
i knew you were a danger to me, especially after halloween.

## now, what does this mirror do?
i see what i desire.

## but how do i get it?
let me speak to him.

## see what i must do to survive?
live off another.

## your parents had it too.
why suffer an horrific death...... when you can join me and live?

## tell me, harry...... would you like to see your mother and father again?
together...... we can bring them back.

## admirers?
what happened in the dungeons between you and professor quirrell is a secret.

## what about hermione?
fine.

## what happened to the stone?
relax, dear boy.

## but then, flamel, he'll die, won't he?
he has enough elixir to set his affairs in order.

## and between you and me, that is saying something.
how is it i got the stone, sir?

## does that mean, with the stone gone, that voldemort can never come back?
i'm afraid...... there are ways in which he can return.

## harry, do you know why...... professor quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him?
it was because of your mother.

## what is it?
love, harry.

## all right there, ron?
all right.

## you?
all right.

## hermione?
never better.

## thought you were leaving without saying goodbye, did you?
this is for you.

## feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?
i'm not going home.

## is it dead?
i don't think so, just knocked out.

## mrs. granger?
i thought i can handle it.

## what's it?
some kinda coat.

## you don't want me as your enemy, quirrell.
why did he give it to you?

## what do you mean?
you know perfectly what i mean.

## stand there.

the sorcerer's stone.

## you all right there, harry?

i think if he got the chance, he might try to kill me tonight.

## who's the one wizard voldemort always feared?

## me?
books and cleverness.

## you?
no, it can't be.

it was because of your mother.

## what is it then?
love, harry.

## all right there, ron?
all right.

## you?

## now, why do you think that is?
well, some people just don't fit the mold, and so far, you know...

## what's up?
okay, here's the thing.

## have you always been like this, or do i bring it out in you?

## what effect do you think you have on me?
i don't quite recognize it.

i only need about four hours a night.

## want me to shut these?
the sun comes in strong in the morning.

that's funny, i haven't noticed that.

## why would you think her bedroom was a kitchen?
it was dark.

## so you date her daughter?
okay.

## when can i be up and running in that department?
i think mr. midnight needs to stay put for another couple of weeks.

## but it won't kill me when i do it, right?
no, it's exercise.

## train?
i don't think so.

## been tough, huh?
he fired his nurse after an hour, and now says he doesn't need one.

## me?
you.

## wait, where's my...?
thank you.

## hello?
hi.

## so, what about the patient?
like he said, he doesn't need a nurse.

## do you want to come in?
i don't want to break your rhythm or anything.

## you up to that?
my doctor recommended it.

## that means you don't want me to?
no.

## do you know that there are over 8000 websites that mention you?
that's not possible.

## you did?
i know you grew up in l. a., which i thought nobody did.

## the truth is, it goes by fast, doesn't it?
like the blink of an eye.

## but why do you only pick up the white ones?
i don't pick up only the white ones.

## what?
so you're as hard on yourself as you are on everyone else.

## can i ask you something, harry?
yeah, sure.

## really?
just like to travel light.

## i'm sorry, but what does that mean?
now, see, a 30 year old gets that.

## have you noticed?
i'm serious.

## are you okay?
yeah, yeah, but...

## you interested?
ringside seat.

## big dinner date?
yeah, as a matter of fact, with your doctor.

## but we're just having dinner, it's not a date.
he's not too young for you?

## does he know that?
i'm gonna tell him.

## julian, can i ask you something?
anything.

## julian, can i ask you something?
anything.

## how old are you?
i'm 36.

## that's a lot of years to be older than somebody, don't you think?
i don't think it matters at all.

## you don't?
i don't.

## honestly?
no.

## so, what do you want to be?
i'd embarrass you if i told you.

## don't you like girls your own age?
i do, but i've never met one i've reacted to...... quite like this.

## and when something happens to you that's never happened to you before...... don't you have to find out what it is?
i don't know.

## you're kidding, right?
no.

## did you ever think of that?
it was interesting.

## what are you doing?
writing.

## what are you doing?
of course.

## so was your date a date?
yeah, i think so.

## with your social life?
my dear, you're confusing sex with sleeping.

## what are my choices?
i mean, i know you think i'm not very discriminating when it comes to...

## what difference does it make what i think of you?
i can't even imagine what you think of me.

## grilled cheese?
pancakes.

## you ever miss being married?
bet you were great at it.

## was one of us just saying something interesting?
you said you can't imagine what i think of you.

## will you tell me first why you only miss being married at night?
the phone doesn't ring that much at night...... and the whole alone thing happens at night.

## i'm sorry, okay?
i'm sorry, but...

## you know what you're like?
you're like one of those great portraits you see over a fireplace.

## such as?
flinty.

## so you think i'm inhuman?
no.

## cold, distant, like i'm frozen in some painting?
not at all.

## you know, i can't decide if, god, do you hate me?
or if you're the only person who ever really got me.

## you don't?
no.

## room service.
mom?

## what are you doing here at this hour?
i had this big benefit.

## this one doesn't sleep either.
you guys are making pancakes?

## hello?
no, i'm here, babe.

## is everybody still there?
okay.

## was he always like this?
i don't know.

## how are you feeling?
well...

## when can you go home?
i really am gonna do a little work, so why don't you just finish this...... and you two catch up.

## you don't want pancakes anymore?
i don't.

## why?
because i met someone else.

## in the two days you've been gone?
never, not even close, i swear to god.

## when could we have dinner again?
i have to work the next few nights.

## so how's friday?
it's a date night, but that's a good thing.

## who is this?
i'm kidding.

## can you meet me at the grill at 8?
okay.

## how'd he take it?
he just took care of it for me.

## and you know what?
it doesn't matter, because we're done and we both feel fine about it.

yes.

## aren't you full of surprises?
yeah.

## what about birth control?

## who's the lucky boy?
okay.

## my blood pressure?
i think it's irresponsible not to.

i really thought i was...... sort of closed up for business.

## let's just not brag about this to your doctor, okay?
honey.

## erica?
erica.

## monogamous?
please.

## but why paris?
i just always wanted to write a play that ended there.

## what do you call this?
eating eggs by candlelight, in our robes...... after...

## so where do you like to eat in paris?
i love this bistro called the grand colbert.

## hey, when is your birthday?
february.

## so how about if we still know each other by then, we go to paris...... for our birthdays, huh?
maybe.

## let me sleep?
yeah.

## well, i'm an old dog, you know?
hey.

## yeah?
at one point...... i even thought...... soul mates.

## can you see this?
not really.

## it looks like it says...... 11?
it is 11.

## it is?
no way.

## oh, my god, that would mean we slept eight hours?
impossible.

## what the hell does that mean?
okay, buddy, your echo looks real good.

## do what?
climb a flight of stairs.

## so how's erica?
erica, as it turns out...... is an amazing woman.

## julian?
thank you...... for everything.

## i am?

i'm almost 30 years old.

## who is he marrying?
i don't know.

## has he lost his mind?
honey...

## i know you're working, but just, please?
i get that he has a right to get remarried, but he doesn't know her.

## do you know what that's like?
that's, like, beyond creepy.

## wanna know why i'm always with the wrong guy?
this is why.

## can you do one other big thing for me?
just say yes, just...

## please?
anything, bubby.

## please?
you know you can handle it.

## you see that look on your face?
that's the gene i didn't get.

## why not?
i put the tie on and everything.

## can you bring me another?
your drink, ma'am.

## thirsty?
i've had a very big week.

## so, kristen, where did you go to medical...... school?
oh, i'm so sorry.

## shall we order?
absolutely.

## do i like duck?
yes, it's rabbit you hate.

## do you?
yeah.

## what was i thinking?

my life has been turned upside down.

## do you know what that's like, after a 20 year marriage...... to feel something for another person that is so...?
that...

## do you know what this is?
no.

## how's that for impervious?
you're killing me.

## what am i gonna do with all this?
taxi.

## can you wait just a second?
the truth is, i...

## that you don't know how to be a boyfriend?
that's not a small thing.

## are we done?
i don't know.

## you having chest pain right now?
no.

## mr. sanborn, what were you doing at the onset of the pain?
having a fight with someone.

## love hurts, haven't you heard?
i've heard.

## stress?
and in case you haven't heard...... stress can give you a heart attack.

## are you crying?
yeah.

## what is it?
i'm in love.

## seems like i gotta learn how to do that...... love them and leave them stuff, you know?
oh, mom, i hate this.

## now do you get my theory about all this?
you gotta self protect.

## you don't actually think that you can outsmart getting hurt?
i think it's worth trying.

## you can't hide from love for the rest of your life...... because maybe it won't work out...... maybe you'll become unglued?
it's just not a way to live.

## are you telling me this is good?
i think you should consider the possibility...... that you and i are more alike than you realize.

## hey, good to see you.
what are you waiting for?

## you having fun?
not quite.

## a note?
a note.

## what can i say?
just tell me you're sorry.

## you're gonna forgive me if i kiss you?
i think so.

oh.

## isn't that funny?
hold on, hold on.

## what are we, four teenagers?
we're all sophisticated people.

## why can't we all stay for the weekend?
your mother has work to do, i've got papers to grade.

## so your play is about us?
no, it's about me.

## am i in it?
well, a guy like you is in it, but he's not you.

## what happens to this guy who's not me?
i haven't totally decided.

## what are you leaning towards?
death.

## death doesn't seem a little harsh to you?
i went where the story took me.

## should we wait for you?
yeah.

## so i'm gonna be the laughing stock of broadway?
harry, he's not you.

## are you feeling all right?
you know...... it isn't like i wanted to stop seeing you.

## why is it that you broads want all or nothing?
i don't know.

## how's that?
fine.

## that men and women can be friends once they've had sex?
i'm friends with my ex husband, but we didn't just have sex.

## then what was it?
i'd love to know.

## can i e mail it to you when i figure it out?
okay.

## you've worried about me?

## where is she?
paris.

## you did?
at first i thought i had the wrong restaurant, but here you are.

## you came here to see me?

## right?
i mean...

## would you like a glass of wine?
yeah.

## you remember how you said if we still knew each other...... we should go to paris for our birthdays?
well, we still know each other.

## the caribbean?
actually, no.

## your past?
i thought if i visited some of the women i've known...... that maybe i could figure out how i arrived at being me.

## hi, how are...?
some of the ladies, i admit, weren't too interested in seeing me...... or even speaking to me, but one day, my losing streak ended.

## how are you?
i'm good.

## buck, should i get it?
yeah, you'll have to.

## hello?
yes, general turgidson is here, but he can't come to the phone now.

## freddie, how are you?
fine.

## and you?
oh, we were just catching up on some of the general's paperwork.

## freddie, the general says could you call back in a minute?
he says it can't wait.

## could you tell me what it's about?
just a second.

## do i have to think of everything?
the general suggests you call general ripper, the 843rd base commander.

## fred?
buck.

## well, are you sure it's plan r?
huh.

## nothing at all?
i don't like the look of this.

## what's up?
nothing.

## where's my shorts?
on the floor.

## where are you going?
no place.

## yes, sir?
i issued instructions for all radios to be impounded.

## we don't want to start a nuclear war unless we have to, do we?
please sit down.

## what about the planes?
surely we must issue the recall code immediately.

## are you certain?
i'm absolutely positive.

## what if it is true?
... i would say, sir, that there was something dreadfully wrong somewhere.

## why don't you take it easy, group captain?
please make me a drink of grain alcohol and rainwater...... and help yourself to whatever you'd like.

## have you got them handy?
when they realize there is no possibility of recalling the wing...... there will be only one course of action open.

## mandrake, do you recall what clemenceau once said about war?
no, i don't think i do, sir.

## staines, is everybody here?
mr. president, the secretary of state is in vietnam.

## general turgidson, what's going on?
it appears that the order called for the planes...... to attack their targets inside russia.

## plan r?
you approved it, sir.

## a safeguard?
i admit the human element seems to have failed us here.

## then why haven't you radioed the planes, countermanding the go code?
we're unable to communicate with any of the aircraft.

## you mean to tell me you will be unable to recall the aircraft?
that's the size of it.

## how soon will the planes penetrate russian radar cover?
about 18 minutes from now.

## are you in contact with general ripper?
no, sir.

## where did you get this information?
general ripper called strategic air command headquarters...... shortly after he issued the go code.

## are there any army units stationed near burpelson?
i'll just check, sir.

## hello?
i told you never to call me here.

## don't you know where i am?
look, baby, i can't talk to you now.

## mr. president?
if i may advise.

## mr. president, there are one or two points i'd like to make, if i may?
go ahead, general.

## any difficulty?
he's having a fit about the m. p. s.

## is that the russian ambassador?
yes, it is, general.

## am i to understand the russian ambassador...... is to be admitted entrance to the war room?
that is correct.

## i don't know exactly how to put this, sir...... but are you aware of what a breach of security that would be?
he'll see everything.

## you don't have any fresh fish?
i'm afraid not, sir.

## your eggs are fresh?
yes, sir.

## that will be all, sir?
i'll see to it right away.

## oh, only commie stooges, huh?
mr. president.

## mr. president?
they haven't reached premier kissoff.

## what is going on here?
i demand an explanation.

## those trucks sure look like the real thing, don't they?
i wonder where they got them from.

## alexi?
alexi, please.

## hello, dimitri?
listen, i can't hear too well.

## could you turn the music down a little?
that's much better.

## i'm coming through fine, too, eh?
good.

## listen.
listen, how do you think i feel about it?

## who should we call?
sorry, you faded away.

## where is that, dimitri?
in omsk.

## what?
i see.

## so we're both sorry, all right?
all right.

## what?
the fools.

## what's happened?
the doomsday machine.

## what is that?
a device which will destroy all human and animal life on earth.

## have you ever seen a commie drink a glass of water?
well, i can't say i have, jack.

## that's what they drink, isn't it?
never water.

## why, do you realize that...... 70  of you is water?
good lord.

## you beginning to understand?
yes.

## have you never wondered why i drink only distilled water...... or rainwater, and only pure grain alcohol?
it did occur to me, jack, yes.

## have you ever heard of fluoridation of water?
yes, i have heard of that, jack, yes.

## do you know what it is?
no, no, i don't know what it is.

## do you realize that fluoridation...... is the most monstrously conceived...... and dangerous communist plot we have ever had to face?
two can play at that game, soldier.

## you calling me, jack?
come over here and help me with this belt.

## the what?
the string.

## what about it?
cobalt thorium g has a radioactive half life of 93 years.

## is the premier threatening to explode it if our planes carry out their attack?
no, sir.

## this is absolute madness.
automatically?

## why should you build such a thing?
there are those of us who fought against it.

## dr. strangelove, do we have anything like that in the works?
a moment, please, mr. president.

## you mean it is possible for them to have built such a thing?
mr. president, the technology required is easily within the means...... of even the smallest nuclear power.

## but how is it possible for this thing to be triggered automatically...... and at the same time impossible to un trigger?
mr. president, it is not only possible...... it is essential.

## how can it be triggered automatically?
it's remarkably simple to do that.

## that ain't no kraut name, is it?
he changed it when he became a citizen.

## why didn't you tell the world?
it was to be announced at the party congress on monday.

## don't you think we'd be better off away from this flying glass?
we're okay here.

## you know when fluoridation first began?
no, i don't, jack.

## it's incredibly obvious, isn't it?
a foreign substance is introduced into our precious bodily fluids...... without the knowledge of the individual.

## supposing a bit of water has gone off, eh?
certainly one can never be too sure about those things.

## do i look all rancid and clotted?
look at me, jack.

## were you ever a prisoner of war?
yes, i was, as a matter of fact.

## did they torture you?
yes, they did.

## what happened?
i don't know, jack.

## no, jack, let me take that for you.
no, i mean, when they tortured you, did you talk?

## you know what i'm hoping?
i'm hoping you're going to give me the code, boy.

## you're going to wash and brush up?
what a good idea.

## put your hands over your head.
supposing i play a little guessing game with you, jack boy?

## who are you?
put your hands over your head.

## what do you mean, suit?
this happens to be an r. a. f. uniform...... and i am group captain lionel mandrake, general ripper's executive officer.

## where's general ripper?
he's dead, in the bathroom.

## where's the bathroom?
next to you.

## put your hands on top of your head.
got any witnesses?

## don't you know that general ripper went mad...... and sent the whole wing to attack the soviets?
i'll tell you what i'm talking about.

## navigator?
i've worked out our rate of fuel loss at approximately 1 6 2 per minute.

## where are you taking me?
to the main gate.

## you wanna know what i think?
yes.

## i am general ripper's executive officer...... so the president will want to speak to me, won't he?
there's a telephone box over there and the line may be open.

## you wanna talk to the president of the united states?
i don't want to talk to him, colonel, i've got to talk to him.

## operator?
this is group captain lionel mandrake.

## could you make this a collect call, operator?
just one second, operator.

## do you think i'd go into combat with loose change in my pocket?
operator, look.

## that's private property.
is it possible to make this an ordinary trunk call?

## okay, i'm gonna get your money for you.
can you imagine?

## but if you don't get the president on the phone, you know what's gonna happen?
you're gonna have to answer to the coca cola company.

## you know what he says?
he says one of the planes hasn't turned back.

## are you sure?
well, i guess you're just gonna have to get that plane, dimitri.

## can i give you just one word of advice, dimitri?
listen, dimitri.

## i don't give a hoot in hell how you do it...... you just get me to the primary, you hear?
i'm sorry, sir, but those are the figures.

## what kind of a target is that, anyhow?
sir, that's the i. c. b. m. complex at kotloss.

## general turgidson...... is there really a chance for that plane to get through?
mr. president, i would not rule out the chance...... to preserve a nucleus of human specimens.

## i would think that possibly one hundred years.
how long would you have to stay down there?

## you mean, people could actually stay down there for 100 years?
it would not be difficult, mein fuhrer.

## i mean, as far as men were concerned?
regrettably, yes.

## and?
instead of having fresh water ice we got salt water ice.

## what's the diffenernt?
the rally of south africa.

## i'll take you to the hospital.

## that's...
i can't believe it?

## michel, is there any problem?

## take your place?
one hour is enough only jean pierre knows.

## what's happened there?
accident, a pigeon.

## why aren't you out to lunch with the girls?
you're a girl.

## why is that?
well, i think some of the girls are a little uncomfortable...... because of what you wear.

## is that so?
well, it just so happens, i think i look nice.

## as long as i have one ass instead of two, i'll wear what i like...... if that's all right with you?
you might wanna rethink those ties.

## with real estate stuff, could you remind me?
i'm a little confused.

hey.

## you always this hard on people who try to help you?
i'm out of practice.

## why do you want to watch my kids?
i like kids.

## you're home every afternoon?
i'm usually working on my bike.

## investigate what?
this real estate thing with the jensens.

## you don't mind?
okay, great.

## donna jensen?
hell, no.

## do you have a minute?
i don't mean to be a pain to pg& e after all they've done for hinkley...... but if they want this place, they're gonna have to pay for it.

## they just wanted to buy it?
oh, yeah, yeah.

## uproot the kids?
i've got a couple of girls.

## what are you doing here?
i had an interesting call this afternoon from dr. frankel...

## oh, yeah?

## wasn't that nice of him?
funny how some people help people, and others just fire them.

## why the hell would you assume that?
maybe you look like someone who has a lot of fun.

## look, what is this what's the story on this cancer stuff?
you wanna know, you have to hire me back.

## because pg& e told her about the chromium?

## an on site monitoring well?
i said so, that's why.

## you think we scared them?
taking the trouble to send someone...... sounds like they're sitting up and taking notice.

## in the interest of putting this to rest...... pg& e is willing to offer the jensens $250, 000 for their home. $250, 000?
in terms of land value in hinkley...... we feel that's a more than fair price.

## you're kidding, right?
look at these readings.

## they send that...... mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my time.
28 billion dollars?

## why?
you heard what that kid said.

## why are you yelling?

but then...... l asked him...... what he makes if i don't get anything.

## you got a pen, honey?
all right, then.

## who would like coffee and cake?

## why not?
because i said no.

## work hard?
let me tell you something.

## what the hell do you know about any of this?
something like this, erin, it could take forever.

## do you know about money?
they settle due to lack of money.

## you know what toxicologists and geology experts cost?
bite my ass, krispy kreme.

## how many families are we talking about?
four more.

## there's more?
i found a document at the water board, a toxic test well reading from 1 967.

## come on, aren't you gonna play?
roll the dice.

## is this the erin brockovich that's been snooping around the water board?
yeah.

## who's this?
you should watch your step.

## who is it?
it's okay.

## the phone might be tapped but what?
that's usual.

## you don't think you're a little out of your league?
that's what those pg& e fucks want me to think.

## you got a problem with me caring for your kids instead of a job?
i can get a job.

## or do you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
i don't know what you're talking about.

## what do you want, a joke?
no, i don't want a joke.

## my beth?
out of the blue like that.

## how are you?

she's getting heavy, and i'll work faster if you take her.

## got a knee for me?
hello.

## what?
i would like to go home.

## everything's done?
we got a lot done.

## did you?
i think i ate three watermelons.

## can you just give me one?
of course.

## you know what?
why don't you guys go ahead without me, and i'll get a ride with ed.

## i'll be right behind you, all right?
i really this is so fine.

## is it okay if i write this down?
i have so many questions.

## and that's what caused the contamination?
it didn't help, but no.

## they skipped that step?
here are the ponds, the plume comes down...... and hinkley is down here...... it's 1 4 years of hexachrome flowing into the groundwater.

## this guy just offered all this information?
well, yeah.

## what's the matter?
i don't know if we can pull this off.

## ... in san francisco.
so?

## what do you mean?
pg& e corporate claims they didn't know about hinkley.

## so what do we do now?
let's assume there are documents connecting pg& e hinkley and corporate...... and they know about them.

## you think if you got no uterus...... and no breasts...... you're still technically a woman?
sure you are.

## we're gonna get them, aren't we?
you gotta promise me that we're gonna get them.

## before i do, is there anything anyone wants to say?
no, your honour.

## what's that?
i saw them in a mall one day.

## you know how long ago that was?
six months ago.

## how can you ask me to do that?
this job....

## what about your kids?
i'm doing more for them now than i did living with my parents.

## you think the men who gave me those children...... asked me what i wanted before walking away?
all i've ever done is bend my life around...... what men decide they need.

## what more can i do to prove that to you?
stay.

## what for?
i mean, you got a raise.

## am i gonna get the best behaviour in the office?
no.

## what's with the attitude?
i just need cool, i need quiet.

## yes?
i don't understand why i don't wanna talk about it now.

## i'll be as quick as i can.
don't talk to me like that!

## matthew, can you watch your sister?
matthew.

## can i come with you?
no, baby, i'll just be a second.

## when was i gonna hear about this?
just listen.

## what the fuck are you talking about?
a few years back, i was trying this airline case...... and i got my ass kicked by this guy.

## will you listen to me?
it doesn't matter.

## what?
pamela has written a letter...... telling everybody to get new lawyers.

## is it true?
no.

## did you?
i'm telling you the truth, and i'll get to the bottom of all of this.

## i'll talk to you soon, okay?
i'm not saying it's not a strong case.

## what's going on in there?
meeting about the pg& e thing.

## are you sure?
yep.

## can i take a brief break here for a moment?
nobody's taking anything.

## how many?
usually they require about 70 .

## do you understand?
this is serious.

## i'm not serious?
you're emotional, you're erratic.

## because you're no good to me sick.
not personal?

## i need you, all right?
this case needs you.

## did you tell them that?
binding arbitration isn't that different from a trial.

## and then a jury decides?
sorry, i forgot to mention that there's no jury in binding arbitration.

## what option do we have if we don't like the result?
none.

## well, which?
there's a big difference.

## yeah, who gets what?
my medical bills started two years ago, before some of the other people here.

## to take that chance.
is this a big decision?

## so how many altogether?
we got just about everybody that came here, but it leaves us about 1 50 short.

## you need a hand with that?
no.

## so how long is this gonna take?
i don't know.

## have the kids eaten?
no.

## wanna get some pancakes?
come on, let's go.

## what time is it?
it's early.

## would you put that back, please?
this girl's the same age as me.

because she's real sick too.

## you want eggs?
eggs would be great.

## you been at this all day?
yeah.

## you want some coffee?
i'd love some.

## don't i know you?
i don't think so.

## matt, can i get that coffee to go?
sure thing.

## what do i owe you?
there's no charge.

## wanna sit at the counter?
hey.

## listen, what's the story with this incredibly, remarkably loud whistle at 5. 30 in the morning?
it's the steam whistle.

## you think?
good choice.

## you never heard of grits?
sure.

## honey, you gonna try it?
you first.

your honour, my clients...

## you understand me?
yes.

## how do your clients plead?
my clients are caught completely by surprise.

## that they plead not guilty?
no.

## are we clear on this?
yes.

## all the way?
all i ask from you is a very simple answer to a very simple question.

## now, how do your clients plead?
i think i get the point.

## will you go for two counts of contempt?
not guilty.

## you know that, right?
let's go.

## why is that?
well, it's a lot of procedure, that's all.

## learn as you go?
yeah, yeah.

## didn't they teach that in law school?
no, they didn't.

## because, between your father's garage and working nights, when was i supposed to go?
i thought this summer i would take off a couple of months.

## are you sure?
yes, i'm sure.

## how can you be so sure when you don't know what it is you're supposed to know?
it's a procedure.

## you know how the first thing you do is you take the carburettor off the manifold?
suppose you skip the first step, and as you're replacing one of the jets, you drop the jet.

## well, is there any way i could help out in this procedure situation?
yeah.

## did you say you got stiffed?
hey.

## a counteroffer?
let me see.

## what do you think?
i could use a good ass kicking, i'll be very honest with you.

ok, then.

## do i have to kill you?
in your dreams.

## if you kicked the shit outta me?
yeah.

## rear ended?
no, i fell.

yeah.

## you can get it?
all right.

## you fell in your place or somebody else's?
my place.

## what am i saying?
you saw what happened in there.

## you wanna stay with him after that?
shit, stan.

## wouldn't your mother be more upset if you die?
the thing is, given the chance, i think he could do a good job.

## is that a drip i hear?
yeah.

## did you use the faucet?
yeah.

## then why didn't you turn it off?
i did turn it off.

## did it occur to you it could be turned off and drip at the same time?
no.

## it's broken?
yeah, that's it.

## you sure?
i'm positive.

## maybe you didn't twist it hard enough?
i twisted it just right.

## how could you be so sure?
if you will look in the manual, you will see that this particular model faucet requires a range of 10 to 16 foot pounds of torque.

## the kind used by caltech high energy physicists and nasa engineers.
how could you be sure you used 16 foot pounds of torque?

## well, in that case, how could you be sure that's accurate?
here's a certificate of validation.

## dead on balls accurate?
it's an industry term.

## miss riley, are those two young men present in the courtroom?
yes, sir.

## now, mrs riley, is this the car?
yes, sir.

## is this the car?
yes.

## what thing?
not for me to say.

## do you have any other witnesses?
no, your honour.

## ask who questions?
you knew you could ask questions.

## didn't you, vin?
if you'd put up a fight, you could have gotten the case thrown out.

## a little?
you got thrown in jail.

## i don't need you to point it out to me, ok?
you're my fiancee.

## is that what you want?
i'm sorry.

## yeah?
so shut it.

## do you wanna go to bed?
i don't know.

## you know what it is?
i'm...

## how the fuck did i get into this shit?
sure.

## if this was a conspiracy, they'd have to get all those people to lie.
if i could keep my ass awake and outta jail long enough, betcha i could, huh?

## do you think that's what's happening?
look, i think we should meet with the public defender.

## it is?
the chair ain't working like it used to.

## now, the evidence against you is pretty strong, so why don't you just tell me your side of the story?
hey, vin.

## ok?
all right.

## where's stan?
he's...

## what, are you scared?
yeah, i'm scared.

## let me tell you how, ok?
the da's gotta build a case.

## he wants to use serious, solid looking bricks, like these, right?
right.

## what was he before he was a lawyer?
if he doesn't ask the right questions, your lawyer will.

## how did he ever talk you into it?
at my cousin ruthie's wedding, the groom's brother was that guy ali kazam.

## the magician with the ponytail?
right.

## how do i know that's not a bunch of ones with a 20 wrapped around it?
it's 200 bucks.

## does that freight train come through at 5am every morning?
no, sir.

## how about you?
well, i got a bullshit traffic ticket.

## i mean, to go out of his way like that for me, you know?
he wanted his son to follow in his footsteps, but he became a musician or something.

## we got some case ahead of us here, huh?
oh, yeah.

## how do you feel about it?
well, i...

## you do?
oh, yeah.

## shouldn't you be preparing for court?
if he'd let me look at his files.

## what does getting to trotter's files have to do with hunting?
well, you know.

## what are you gonna hunt?
i don't know.

## what kind of heads?
i don't know.

## you're gonna shoot a deer?
i don't know.

## i'm not gonna go out there just to wimp out, you know?
i mean, the guy'll lose respect for me.

## you think they're ok?
lmagine you're a deer.

## would you give a fuck what kind of pants the son of a bitch who shot you was wearing?
i'd sure like to get a look at your files.

## you would?
sure.

## you got a xerox machine over there?
no.

## shirley, can you xerox all the files on the gambini/ rothenstein case for mr gambini?
yeah.

## what's all that?
trotter's files.

## you stole his files?
i didn't steal his files.

## are you reading this book?
yeah.

## do me a favour, ok?

but you just look like a little kid.

## can i ask you something?
sure.

## but you'll fight with them just the same?
i'll tell you one thing...

## by definition, their motives, their behavior, everything about them would be... alien.
you want to tell me what the hell went wrong?

## so how much longer do we wait?
that's entirely up to you.

## neither one of you has ever been hunting, am i right?
i went out with some guys once when i was maybe 14.

## how are you?
i'm all right, ma'am.

## what you got up there?
some sort of toxic spill, ma'am.

## ah, is that what they told you?

## you're not gonna let me through, are you?
no, ma'am.

## what?
arrest me and have someone take me to general beers.

## they're not coming, are they?
maybe they're not that worried about her, maybe they think she can fight her own battles.

## you son of a bitch.
you don't know when to quit, do you?

## did you think i was just going to let you take the project away from me, you and the general here?
you bastard.

i would have thought that he wouldn't need to be told.

## how do you want your marriage to be?
passionate...

## isn't it honest?
not emotionally.

## like we're just... going through the motions, you know?
and i want more.

## our politicians?
hardly.

## our priests?
you'd be amazed at how many clients come to see me because they once believed in a priest.

## our parents?
home is a sanctuary.

## feel safe in it?
loving someone means we have to relinquish power.

## but how can this take place?
trust.

## do you want a whiskey?
i've got an early client.

## why don't we take separate cars in the morning?
i've got a late meeting.

## and?
against my better judgement, i said yes.

## and you like him?
yes, i do.

## so?
he comes encumbered... with a wife.

## is he gay?
when he's with me, he seems to be.

## does she know about you?
i assume so.

## she would sense it, wouldn't she?
it depends on how good he is at deceiving her.

## having a party, jane?
yeah.

## did you want to join me?
take this inside for mommy.

## well?
yeah.

## where?
in a motel.

## is that what you do?
i don't know.

he's not happy.

## you want me to be honest?
no.

## when are you gonna take that thing off?
it's too tight.

## what have you got to lose?
just a little dignity.

## is that really awkward?
no, it's fine.

## how are you?
i'm good.

## paula?
mmm.

## she's seeing a cop now?
don't be nosy, nik.

## are her and pete getting back together or what?
i don't know.

## what do i say then?
nothing.

## the baby's sick?
yeah.

## leon?
oh fuck.

## what is it?
it's nothing.

## should i get a doctor?
i get this pain in my chest sometimes.

## i don't have a weak heart, all right?
this is not an affair, it's a one night stand that happened twice.

## do you worry that we don't make love very often?
no.

## why not?
i love you.

## is this a test?
no.

## why do women always want to know that?
you're up late.

## you want one?
i've got one.

## what's wrong?
nothing.

## are you all right?
sorry.

## what happened?
i fell.

## are you all right?
it's nothing.

## do you think i should be?
it doesn't matter what i think.

## how?
she's very needy.

## are you trying to justify his deceit?
no, i'm trying to understand it.

## but isn't it still an act of deceit?
no marriage can be based on that.

## because i'm gay, i can't have an opinion...?
it's not what i was...

## what do you mean?
i think some women like to live the lie.

## patrick?
yes.

## what happened to your head?
i bumped it on a clothes line.

## why are you trying so hard to fuck up your life?
you don't know how lucky you are to have the marriage you've got.

## what about yours?
i'm separated.

## can you tell?
no.

## desperate?
no.

## are you guys coming?
i thought we'd have a nice dinner together.

## what was that about?
hey, she needed a partner.

## and you happened to volunteer?
she chose me.

## how are you, mate?
drove by to see jane.

## did you see her tonight?
no.

## you don't know where she is then?
no, sorry.

## how is she?
the last time i saw her, okay.

## how are you going?
good.

## if there was something i should know, you'd tell me?
it'd be easier.

## so why did you and your husband split up?
i don't know.

## it was that simple?
no.

## i'm wondering why... why have you been seeing me if you're still in love with your wife?
i don't know.

## why?
i don't like... what he's doing.

## do you think about her very much?
of course i do.

## do you think i did the wrong thing?
i just wanted the whole... world to know.

## are you okay?
yeah.

## you want coffee?
yeah, sure.

## how is he?
not good.

## are you guys all right for money?
yeah.

## yeah?
no.

## you sure there's no bill you want to clear?
it's fine.

## why didn't you wake me up?
i thought you could do with the rest.

## so, you'll be home late?
yeah.

## what would you do if he was?
i...

## and does that scare you?
yeah.

## you know?
and i have these two...

## it's not that he might have slept with another woman, you know?
it's that he might not tell me.

## valerie?
patrick phelan is here.

## would it make a difference if i were straight?
i don't have a problem with your sexuality.

## my role?
i'm a respite from a marriage that's gotten too hard.

## how?
he takes refuge in me.

## what do you offer him?
sex unencumbered by need.

## why doesn't he leave her?
good men don't know how to leave their wives.

## good men or cowardly men?
he told me that making love to her was like trying to fill an empty well.

## what?
you said something to me.

## you heard him, didn't you?
this is bullshit...

## bullshit?
yeah.

## you all right?
yeah.

## you sure?
you don't look all right.

## are you a cop?
yeah.

## really?
really.

## can i have a whiskey, dry please?
excuse me.

## why didn't you tell me?
because you haven't been around much lately.

## what are you gonna do?
banning it won't solve the problem.

## what are you doing here?
you found john and valerie.

## are you there?
okay, i've had an accident.

## where are you?
you didn't say you'd be late.

## john?
there is a man.

## we'll talk when i get home, okay?

## what have we got?
locals got a call, about 12:30 am from the husband.

## mr. somers?
knox.

## do you mind if we come in?
mr. knox, it appears that your wife ran off the road.

## should i go there?
we're conducting a search, but... if she accepted a lift from somebody, it's unlikely she'll be there.

## would you mind answering a few questions?
i've been through all this with the police.

## i know, but would you mind telling me what happened last night?
i got home around midnight.

## that's when you called the police?
no, i waited about 20 minutes.

## so you called at about 12:20?
yes, more or less.

## do you have a photo of your wife we could have, please?
thank you.

## how was your wife yesterday?
fine.

## nothing troubling her?
no.

## right now, i'd say it's pretty bad, wouldn't you?
none of this is particularly pleasant.

## you're married?
yeah.

## if your wife got into a stranger's car... a man, let's assume... and didn't come home, what would you imagine?
right now, i'd be going mad.

## in what sense?
she's upset.

## what's with the face?
i fell over.

## you were pissed?
a little.

## you packed your bag, hannah?
quickly.

## what?
you know, don't invite nik in for coffee when i'm not here.

## all her notes and session tapes are kept in a filing cabinet.
all right?

## do you mind?
no.

## how was she yesterday?
all right.

## is she the kind of person that would get into a stranger's car?
no.

## is that ethical?
probably not.

## do you still love him?
good evening.

## why do you think she turned off the freeway?
some people say it's shorter.

## who's patrick?
i don't know.

## what kind of trouble?
she didn't go into it.

## why not?
it's unprofessional.

## even between husband and wife?
yes.

## why?
most men hold something back.

## you're some kind of academic, aren't you?
i'm dean of law.

## how's your marriage been lately?
fine.

## how's yours?
up and down.

## where were you friday night?
i was at work.

## can anybody verify that?
no, i was alone.

## and you like him?
yes, i do.

## so?
he comes encumbered... with a wife.

## don't you have a home to go to?
yes.

## did you find anything?
she dedicated the book to john.

## did you listen to phelan's tapes?
yeah.

## what did you think?
she didn't like the man.

## what about you?
soon.

## talked to mystery man yet?
he never came back.

## did you watch the news?
yeah.

## will you find her?
it's not looking good.

## why didn't you tell me?
because it was private.

## why?
because i'm numb.

## why did you sleep on the couch?
i came in late last night.

## are you fighting?
yeah, a bit.

## why?
there's something we've got to sort out.

## you all right, mom?
yeah.

## can you grab something to eat?
we're running late.

i fucked up.

## fine?
we didn't end our last session on very good terms.

## why is that?
we disagreed about something.

## how did you know about that?
that went well.

## dylan?
hi, dad.

## could i speak to your mom?
no, she's still pissed off at you.

## what did he say?
he said that he's sorry, that he loves you, and he wants you to stop being angry with him.

## the other question is, why don't you?
don't be deceived by appearances.

## want a whiskey?
somebody may have hurt your wife.

## of what?
of being alone.

## is it an affair?
no.

## is that what's going on?
i believe that's what valerie thought was going on.

## what are you talking about?
for some reason, she believe you were involved with patrick phelan.

## i don't have to listen to this?
yes, you do.

## what are you doing about it?
i'm trying to find her.

## have you ever cheated on your wife?
no.

## never desired another woman?
yes, of course.

## but you never acted on it?
no.

## so there is someone else?
no.

## so where were you?
i left work late.

## love?
maybe habits sometimes, passion, our kids.

## you didn't love her anymore?
we got a call from a man, saying his wife saw a neighbor throw a shoe into a vacant lot on the night valerie disappeared.

this could be tricky.

## why?
i know the woman.

## how are you?

you've had your dinner.

## have you got any milk fed chicken?
yes, sir.

## how many men do you think draw a handsome salary?
you can count them on the fingers of one hand, my good woman.

## do you know why i sat with her?
because she reminded me of you.

## really?
of course.

## how do you account for that?
she figures that out, she's good.

## you see that man eating spaghetti?
no.

## you see the spaghetti, don't you?
behind that spaghetti is none other than herman gottlieb... director of the new york opera company.

## do you follow me?
yes.

## don't you see?
you'll be a patron of the opera.

## what are you doing?
if you four people want to play bridge, don't mind me, go right ahead.

## and she's crazy about you, too?
even if she was, i couldn't ask her to marry me.

## how soon does the curtain go up?
the curtain, mr. driftwood, will go up again next season.

## isn't lassparri the greatest tenor that ever lived?
he's superb.

## what's the difference?
he must sail with us tomorrow no matter what we pay.

just as you think. $1, 000.

## why don't i sign lassparri?
i represent mrs. claypool.

## what do you want?
rosa.

## what do you care?
i can't pronounce it.

## could he sail tomorrow?
you pay him enough money, he could sail yesterday.

## how much you pay him?
i don't know.

i'll take it.

## how much does that leave?
well, that leaves him $8.

## can he live in new york on $3?

## don't you know what duplicates are?
sure, those five kids up in canada.

## what does it say?
go on and read it.

## can you hear?

here we are.

## that's pretty neat, eh?
no, it's no good.

## what's the matter with it?
i don't know.

## would you like to hear it once more?
just the first part.

## what?
no.

## why should we quarrel about this?
we'll take it out.

## now what do we got left?
i got about a foot and a half.

## now what's the matter?
i don't like the second party either.

## why can't the first part of the second party... be the second part of the first party?
then you got something.

## you don't like what?
whatever it is, i don't like it.

## ready?
okay.

## is my word good enough for you?
i should say not.

## how is it my contract is skinnier than yours?
i don't know, you must have been out on a tear last night.

## we're all set now, aren't we?
sure.

## but it's a contract, isn't it?
sure.

## that?
that's the usual clause.

## could you tell me where signor lassparri is?

## miss castaldi, ready for the big trip?
mr. gottlieb.

## is it as funny as all that?
mr. otis b. driftwood seems to think you have quite a voice.

## my dear friends, i am so sorry, i must be excused... but i have a slight touch of laryngitis.
yes?

## why should i sing for them when i'm not being paid for it?
please sing.

## hasn't he a wonderful voice?
there must be a place for him in new york.

## fifty eight?
that's me.

## hit and run driver?
i'm sorry, sir.

hi, gottlieb, always beating around the bush.

## anything i can do?
just a little homesick.

## do you like it?
twin beds.

## what would people say?
they'd say you're a very lucky woman.

## will you please shut up so i can continue reading?
no, i will not shut up.

## and will you kindly get up at once?
all right, i'll go.

## what situations have you got?
i most certainly will not go to your room.

## shall we say 10 minutes?
yes, 10 minutes.

## fifty eight?
that's an awful big number for a birdcage this size.

## say, who is responsible for installing me in this telephone booth?
mr. gottlieb picked it out for you, sir.

## gottlieb?
that's awfully decent of him.

## did he pick out the whole room or just the porthole?
i'm sure you'll find it cozy, sir.

## anything else, sir?
yes.

## what are you doing here?

## yes?
i'm the engineer.

## did you want a manicure?
no.

## did you want your nails long or short?
you better make them short.

## is it my imagination, or is it getting crowded in here?
i got plenty of room.

## is my aunt minnie in here?
you can come in and prowl around if you want to.

## use the phone?
i'll lay you even money you can't get in.

## do you rumba?
why, yes.

## fortune hunter?

## you mean gottlieb?
i mean those two uncouth men i saw you around the opera house with.

## why, have they slipped off?
sit down.

## you think it's safe?
if they catch us, they'll deport us.

## what will we lose?
if we're deported, they'll feed us.

## does it mean nothing to you that i'm the world's greatest singer?
but i love to hear you sing, rodolfo.

i'm afraid i don't.

## ever hear of him?
riccardo.

## after a meal like that?
please let him play.

## stowaways?
we'll soon find out.

## are you crazy?
you got it.

## what's he doing now?
i think he's hanging himself.

## what'll i say?
tell them you're not here.

## suppose they don't believe me?
they'll believe you when you start talking.

## we get halfway over, when what do you think happened?
we forgot the airplane.

## what will you give me to set fire to your beard?
we're all right as long as the water supply holds out.

## what's that you say?
you heard me.

## you hear what they say?
they've never been so insulted, and they refuse to stay.

## what are you singing about?
read this.

## what will you do?
first, i'll throw those two gorillas out.

## why don't you fellows be nice?

## am i?
that's all right, boys.

## how are all my songbirds?
fine.

## nice day, isn't it?
it has its points.

## you mean, what's coming off here?
you can't do that.

## wanna bet?

## what's the meaning of this?
if you think that i'm going to....

## for me?
mrs. claypool has decided to dispense with your services immediately.

she hasn't even had them.

## how do you know?
you couldn't find them.

## the stairs?
yeah.

## where can i find you?

## what do you think?
lassparri.

## lassparri?
he won't let her sing tonight.

## what?
i want you to sing.

## you hear that?
that's real singing.

## is this the opera house?
arrest those men, and this one, too.

## do you know what they did to me?
i'll sing them an encore that they'll never forget.

## what's that?
lf they're arrested, i ought to be, too.

## what do we do?
we must have them.

## well, what is it you want?
first, call off that police dog.

## since when?
since baroni started singing.

## now, where were we?
no.

## what?
your name is out of the paper too long.

## suck up to her like everybody else?
it couldn't hurt.

## mind if i join you?
lights out.

## smoke?
look what some johnny sent me.

## hey, great mentioned that you're on a trip today, huh?
there have been so many, i just can't keep track.

## you think so?
okay, roxie.

## you think you're fooling me?
you're all washed up.

## this all took place in lesurevelt?
lncredible.

## really?
yeah, get this.

## i'm alone!
good night, folks.

## would you mind saying a word or two?
sure i'll say things.

## are you sorry, dear?
yeah, i'm sorry that i got caught.

## was that your question?
yeah, that's my...

## she's very hot spirit, isn't she?
miss baxter...

## did you get my trial date yet?

## what a helling, huh?

## what the hell do i care about pineapples?

## how does it feel, kid?
pretty soon we couldn't find your name in the papers.

## mr. flynn?
oh, no.

## well, doctor, is she or isn't she?
she is.

## would she swear that statement in court?
yes.

## hey, roxie, who's the father?
the question is completely out of line.

## amos, my name is amos.
how dare you insult this young woman?

## who says it wasn't?
it was the kid's name i was thinking about.

## you know when she dues?

roar, roar, roar.

## amos?
that's right, mr. flynn.

## amos, when did you file sue for divorce?
a month ago.

## was there any reason for filing at this particular time?
i'd say, the newspapers said roxie was expecting a little stranger.

## that's hardly a cause for divorce, isn't it?
a little too much of a stranger.

## do you sleep with your wife?
yes, sir, every night.

## you expect the jury to believe that you slept next to this woman every night without exercising the rights of a husband?
i could if i want to.

## did what?
want to.

## didn't what?
what you wanted.

## since you ever question roxie herself, did you even bother to ask her if you were the father of the child?
no, sir.

## what?
lf you confirm that you were wrong, you'd be man enough in a minute.

## roxie, i have here a statement that you admitted having illicit relation with deceased fred casely.
she does?

## ls this statement true or false?
i'm afraid that's true.

## when did you first meet fred casely?
when he sold amos and me our furniture.

## amos, when did you file suit for divorce?
a month ago.

a little too much of a stranger.

## do you share a bed with your wife?
yes, sir, every night.

## you expect this jury to believe that you slept next to this woman every night without exercising your rights as a husband?
i could have if i wanted to.

## did what?
want to.

## didn't what?
what you wanted.

## did you even bother to ask her if you were the father of her child?
no, sir.

if you became convinced that you were wrong, you'd be man enough to admit it.

## which she does.
wouldn't you?

## roxie, i have here a statement in which you admit to having... illicit relations with the deceased, fred casely.
she does?

## is this statement true or false?
i m afraid that's true.

## about what?
i didn't like him working those long hours at the garage.

poor child has had no relief.

## what do you expect?
i mean these days you get a little success and it's good riddance to the people who put you here.

## you think i got you up here just so you can listen to my radio?
people write some pretty interesting things when they think no one's looking.

## you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing by the truth, so help you god?
and then some.

## miss kelly, will you please tell the court if the object i m holding is the one you happened to came upon in the defendant's jail cell?
yes, it is.

## what's the big deal?
it's just a bunch of doodlings.

## what?

## maybe to drop all charges against you in exchange for testifying here today?
i d be delighted.

fred casely assured me he'd get me an audition down at the onyx.

## you like those?
beneath the yellow folder... you'll find your latest rejection slip... from the archives.

## what's that?
i think we ought to give him a story.

yeah, fine.

## yes, sir?
janet.

## are you still keeping these thoughts from john?

oh, they're fine.

## when did you begin having this feeling?
well... last week.

## oh, so it was recently when you tried this?
oh, well, it was kind of recently, but not... real recently.

## what about it do you like?
i...

## well... you know the cliche about the security of it?
well, that's true.

## so, how long has it been since you've seen john?

yeah, or go someplace in a hurry.

## do you want some help?
no, no, really, i'm fine.

## graham, do you pay taxes?

## what's the first?

## annie, why don't you go with graham to hunt for apartments?

## would you mind, graham?
no, i'd love that.

it couldn't be these bozos.

## we've contacted your school.

## skirt chasers will try anything these days...

i have no doubts regarding number 25's abilities.

## what about you, colonel?
my job isn't to believe or disbelieve.

## all systems nominal, then?
look at what they abandoned in their panic.

## don't kick yourself over it, okay?
well, i guess saying i'm kei's boyfriend might be stretching it a bit.

## is he really okay?
all i know for sure is that he's not a spy.

## what's the objective?
detailed data on the new subject.

## new subject?
that's an intriguing story.

## will you be taking the boy with you?

## a fish out of water dies, huh?

## aren't you?
kaneda sends his regards.

## you did this, tetsuo?
so anyway...

## shit...
where's kaneda's bike?

## he went to where akira is?
that's what that girl said.

## it has something to do with that power of tetsuo's, right?
ryu told me about it once.

## humans do all kinds of things during their lifetime, right?
discovering things, building things...

## humans were like monkeys once, right?
and before that, like reptiles and fish.

## if that's true, what memories are hidden in it?

## did you get hit on the head back there?
maybe everyone has those memories.

## that's what akira is?
amoebas don't build houses and bridges.

that's what tetsuo's doing?

## huh?
this has got to be a trap.

## what do you mean?
it can't be helped.

## what're you gonna do?
i'm sorry, sir...

## is this for real?
what you see here seems to be fires caused by tank cannons.

## he wants this, doesn't he?
we should call the gang together.

## you shouldn't use your power this way.
wha?

## what?
yeah, but i already took care of it.

## well, did you hit him?
we're too close to the impact point.

## what the?
they say it's sol.

## when tetsuo's power reaches its peak?
that's when we do it.

## but will it work?
the future doesn't proceed along a single course.

## what's tetsuo's status?
ah.

## tetsuo?
he never existed in the first place.

## medicine...
what's wrong?

## did you hear that, doctor?
yes, colonel.

## can you see any signs of it?
i'm not entirely certain, but it seems that the power that had been held back by the drugs is breaking free.
