## who do you think you are to call me that?
for what you once said.

## he should have died three years ago.
who?

## what were the words he wrote?
all under heaven.

## do you know why?
to guard against assassins.

## how should i reward you?
my service was for qin, not for a reward.

## how did you defeat such opponents?
yes, i do.

## why?
flying snow had an affair with sky.

## why haven't i heard this before?
i went to great lengths to uncover it.

## what did you use to defeat sky?
this is my territory.

## so?
you are on the king's most wanted list.

## was your sword swifter than theirs combined?
no.

## how did you do it, then?
disguised as a citizen of zhao.

## who are you?
i'm from yi county in the kingdom of zhao.

## which calligrapher do you seek?
i respectfully request master highcliff.

## what do you want written?
sword.

## you are fond of the sword?
it was my father's dying wish.

## what size scroll?
eight feet.

## did you hear me, master springbrook?
master highcliff wants to borrow red ink.

## could i have some red ink?
they drew strength from their calligraphy.

## master springbrook.
wouldn't that be ideal?

## why are you going outside?
to fend off the arrows.

## who are you?
i've traveled here to deliver an item.

## it would reveal his swordsmanship?
but it's just an ordinary word.

## did you discover it?
it eluded me.

## so how did you challenge them?
although they hadn't spoken in three years they spied on each other.

## sky died by your sword?
yes.

## why are you here?
i'm from the kingdom of qin.

## who?
flying snow.

## why do you laugh?
what you did last night was stupid.

## who?
me.

## would you like my impression of them?
three years ago they stormed the palace.

## who?
you.

## what's that?
he permitted it.

## what convinced him you could succeed where he had failed?
you have trained, perhaps for 10 years with one goal, my assassination.

## so why seek out broken sword and flying snow?
i surmise that your skill requires you to come within 10 paces.

## how far am i from the bookshelves?
about 10 paces.

## did i hurt you too much?
i should be the one who fights him.

## if you died, how could i live?
you will live on, promise me.

## what are you here for?
for what you once said.

## why?
he and she are bound in life and death.

## a citizen of qin would not do this.
how did you uncover my plan?

## who are you?
a man of zhao.

## however you too have underestimated someone.
what is that?

## who?
broken sword.

## how is sky now?
fully recovered.

## what went wrong?
i abandoned the plan.

## he said that?
yes.

## why?
i also asked him.

## what did he say?
your special medicine should heal his wounds in a day.

## have you delivered it?
i tended to the wound myself.

## how is flying snow?
she is resting.

## doesn't qin want to conquer zhao?
yes.

## isn't the king the enemy of zhao?
yes.

## you call yourself a man of zhao?
flying snow has asked me that too.

## was your sword forged in hatred?
yes.

## how can i dissuade you?
only by killing me.

## are you that determined?
yes.

## why did you want to do that?
i wanted to follow the example of my master and to persuade you with my life.

## what were the words he wrote?
all under heaven...

## he must have abandoned the mission.
i would like to know how you mean to kill me without your sword?

## what did you say to him?
i wrote three words.

## what words?
all under heaven.

## how can i convince you?
draw your sword.

## why didn't you fend off my sword?
so that you'd believe me.

## why didn't you?
no more drifting, no more roaming.

## permission to execute?
he conspired to assassinate your majesty.

## blimey o'reilly fred.
he in my bloody room again?

## what the devil have you put in this tea?
smells all ammoniary, dad.

## ask her what she was mixing up in the kitchen last night.
have you been using your mother's...... cups and saucers for your bloody experiments?

## me?
yes, you.

## oh, you didn't use the best china winn?
she most certainly did.

## what was she mixing?
her stuff.

## what stuff?
yes.

## yeah, shut up you.
what was that stuff?

## did you or did you not mix up some stuff in one of your mother's best teacups?
yes.

## what was it?
doesn't matter what it was.

## private?
women's private.

## you are not pregnant, are you?
no i'm not.

## you didn't tell me about that stuff.
what was she mixing?

## how was i supposed to know about it?
i knew there would be some who would want to stand in my way.

## he's a gp, you see?
no, he isn't.

## are these what you wanted?
thank you, miss buttler.

## do you fancy a date, graham?
don't be shy.

## what have you got today?
advanced pathology and a cycle of killers.

## mustard powder?
i've a contact.

## sue and me... or is it me and sue?
have a date this friday night.

## when did she give you that?
your months out of date pal.

## oh, you don't believe me, graham?
go on.

## what you do to me?
i get a feeling, it's an oody doodie feeling...... that you're the one for me.

## it looks like a road accident, doesn't it, sue?
we'd a terrible one last summer.

## was anybody hurt?
yes.

## what do you think about this?
they're not mine.

## you wouldn't do this in a million years if you had any respect for your body, would you?
no, mum.

## then what were they doing behind the immersion tank in my bedroom?
i don't know whose they are.

## dennis?
dennis is a supervisory weights and measures officer...... for the board of trade, thank you very much.

## you contaminate everything you touch, don't you?
mum's inside, with doctor scott.

## how the hell should i know?
i told you, he's in there now.

## lavage?
an enema, father.

## have you any idea what brought it on?
rich food, i imagine.

## in this house?
i've given her some soothing medicine for her tummy...

## would you not sneak up on people like that?
sorry.

## what's turned you into an angel all of a sudden?
nothing.

## what are you getting at?
nothing really, just a thought.

## like what?
like death.

## quite the young toff these days, aren't we?
looks like a bloody funeral director.

## been out courting, nephew?
i'm afraid i don't have time for anything but my work these days, auntie.

## so what's your diagnosis on all this then graham?
well, dr. scott seems to think it's some kind of nervous stomach disorder...... but i'm exploring other avenues.

## and you say she bought it from boots?
oh, you've no idea how many lethal products are sold over the counter these days, auntie.

## well, they're normally very good, aren't they?
they do these wine making kits now.

## aren't you, graham?
suspicion had been voiced.

## pull yourself together, will you?
i'm going to find out what's behind this if i have to tear the house apart.

## you did, didn't you?
don't think i'll be here to look after you.

## christ, just look at her, will you?
i don't reckon she even knows who we are anymore.

## yes she has, haven't you mum?
she hasn't, you know.

## have you been to the toilet for solids, in the past 24 hours, mother?
for solids, not just pee pee.

## she's trying to tell us something.
for god's sake, can't you see?

## is it the medicine?
what she's trying to say is...... she wants us to give it to her.

## what the hell are we supposed to do?
don't tell me to piss off.

## may i help you to some pickle, uncle jack?
yeah, go on.

## you know?
same symptoms as your mum.

## stroke of bad luck that, isn't it?
think i heard everyone in your street has come down with some bug or other.

## have you any idea where he is?
he's not here at the moment.

## was it you who called?
pink card, mr. trent.

## fourteen years old, eh?
welcome to harshhurst, son.

## mummy?
he was about to relive this episode for the second time that night.

## perhaps this new bloke might be able to do something for me.
did you never have this, graham... your mum, visions and that?

## what new bloke?
i heard in the office we are getting a new senior... psy... chologist...... chiatrist.

## have any of them had any kind of...... individual treatment since they arrived?
doctor zeigler, these patients are not labelled chronic simply for our convenience.

## so, all of these men are classified as psychopaths?
moral imbeciles to a man.

## what's your name, boy?
berridge, sir.

## and why are you here, berridge?
i killed my parents, sir.

## and if you had your time over, would you do it again?
no, sir.

## why do you think you would not do it again?
because they'd send me back to this place, sir.

## did you speak, boy?
sorry, sir, but vulpes means wolf, sir.

## are you going to cure me, sir?
sit down, please.

## do you think i'll ever get out?
i don't think we should speculate on these things just at the moment.

## do you think that you're up to it?
i want to live rightly and lovingly, sir.

## and what do you think has prevented you from doing so up until now?
i don't know, sir.

## and you always believe what doctor triefus says to you?
maybe you'll allow me to be the judge of that from now on.

## how so, sir?
well, i like to think that our...... emotional functions are not unlike our...... limbs, our organs, they can be broken, damaged.

## you're going to fix me, sir?
well, it's not just going to be up to me.

## how will you know i'm not faking it?
because...

## d'you see?
i'm gonna be with you on this journey.

## you'd like me to tell you my dreams, sir?
yes, i want you to... write them down.

## will you do that for me?
i think it's a wonderful idea, sir.

## what do you think this is trying to tell us?
i think it's trying to tell us that we're wasting our time.

## do you have any idea how much trouble i've gone to on your behalf?
there's 700 men in this institution...... i've got the impossible task of selecting a handful...... with whom i can find the time to work.

## you what?
i think we need to extract them.

## and then, once they're on paper...... we have them, you see?
they're ours.

## what exactly would you like us to conclude from all this?
well, yes, all right.

## who can we help?
i mean...

## what is the purpose of our work here?
and so, thanks to the zeal of doctor zeigler...... i was plucked from the ranks and planted firmly on the road to recovery.

## we mustn't let it fester, must we?
not like your parents.

## sometimes it isn't our place to help, you know?
that's a lesson i've had to learn many times... in my work.

## like berridge was?
goodbye dr. zeigler.

## yes?
and you'll leave this with me over the weekend.

## yes?
and then later you used the same substance to poison your step mother.

## am i right?
i'm not that simple.

## thallium?
it's a heavy metal, probably...... the most toxic substance known to man.

## you see?
you wanted to make something beautiful in that flask, that day.

## why should i share my knowledge with you?
you've told me what i am.

## i've got nothing, i can't feel anything, fine?
but i have my secrets.

## and why should i show them to you or anybody else?
they're mine.

## and would you believe i cried real tears?
torrents and torrents of them.

## perhaps we should see the patient for ourselves?
please, be seated, graham.

## so, who'd like to kick off?
graham, we were all impressed by your academic achievements here at harshhurst.

## have you found any that work?
well, we still haven't found a cure for the common cold, i'm afraid.

## anyone else?
yes.

## and how can you be sure that they will not present themselves again?
well, sir...

## aren't you glad?
this is everything that we've worked for.

## who'll look after all this after i'm gone?
it'll all go to waste.

## where will i go?
god willing, you'll strike out on your own.

## hasn't really changed much, has it?
wait until you get inside.

## isn't it, dennis?
oh, yeah.

## what on earth is it?
it's an id tag.

## den you're joking, after all them chocolates?
i must say i'm feeling a little peckish too.

## ap.
i'll make some sandwiches, shall i?

## apple sauce?
yes, yes, maybe it would.

## you're here for the storekeeper's job?
yes.

## really?
fucking waste of time coming.

## next please?
you'll be happy to know that the placement officer...... at the home office has finally found me a job.

## queen mum for you ray, and douglas the dog for you, right nathan?
so if you brought those two out here.

i can't feel my fingers.

## no, thanks simon, i'm a little busy.

## is it just feeling sore, or is it more a stitch sort of thing?
flaming nora.

## terrible news about billy, isn't it, debra?
oh, yes, yes.

## do they know what's wrong with him?
some kind of stomach thing, i think.

## yes, but, do they know what caused it?
all that i know is that he's in hospital.

## do you think there's a virus going around?
look, i've got to get on, graham.

## god, ray, are you all right?
i was going to ask you to sign this get well card.

## why are you always slooping around here, graham?
you don't work in here, you work in the store room.

## i beg your pardon, john?
there's something about you, graham, i just don't like.

## what are you saying, john?
i'm not saying anything.

21 00:07:58, 587 > 00:07:59, 986 i didn't even see that.

## when is chickliss coming back?
some time this week.

## you're trying to psych me out or what?
i can't hear myself think.

## you sure?
yes.

## what?
no way.

## you know the other night i heard some noise.
ah come on, how did you...?

## noise?
yeah.

## really?
yeah.

## you don't think that...?
you dreamt it.

## what?
they come for you at night.

## who does?
good.

## are we locked?
sorry.

## when's the last time you remember being outside?
last night.

## isn't that weird?
you're weird.

## you know who these are?
111 00:16:10, 227 > 00:16:14, 300 arthur and sunshine.

## touch me again, soldier, and you'll be eating your eyeballs.
where is she?

## what do you know about me?
tattoo, on you forehead.

## you're on the squad, right killer?
you show up by night and people disappear.

## why did you do that?
because you're scum.

## a little girl?
no.

## what if they drop children in here?
i gotta keep moving.

## why?
there are traps.

## how do you know?
because of this.

## are you a doctor?
i don't know.

## you guys have a plan?
we keep moving in the same direction until we find the edge.

## what about the traps?
i keep thinking i've seen her before...

## neatness counts?
very funny.

## i know, i'm not getting involved ok?
i'm drawing.

## can we spend 5 minutes without bringing up owen and chickliss please?
and get us back on real time.

## what?
okay, what i wanna know...

## what?
a third exit.

## about what?
one day, you're gonna wake up inside.

## you got a problem with me lady?
yeah.

## why?
i don't trust you.

## clues to who built this place?
i think that's just a coincidence.

## what do they mean?
i think it's a mistake to think of these letters as meaning something.

## we should make a map.
a puzzle?

## our blood?
i don't know.

## you got a better idea?
i have a better idea.

## you're gonna ride in on your white horse and whisk her out?
the rooms can realign to zero position.

## and what's the first thing the program does when the rooms realign to zero position?
clean sweep.

## don't you ever feel?
son, you're outta line.

## like what?
we're waiting for orders, it's what we do best.

## do i look like i'm kidding?
this one's s d f.

## okay, so they're commas.
what?

## what difference does it make?
we don't even know what the letters mean yet.

## well isn't that how you plot coordinates on a graph?
x coordinate, comma, y coordinate, comma, z coordinate.

## what fact?
there are only 26 letters in the english alphabet.

## so?
so we know the parameters.

## what is it now?
please tell me that's not...

## would you put that away?
there's no consent form.

## you think they're gonna stop this whole operation because you lost a piece of paper?
i didn't lose it.

## see?
told you i recognized her.

## what do you mean?
i mean, there might not be a consent form.

## get it?
but that's illegal.

## and how are we gonna do that?
call up.

## well what do you think this is?
i don't see a fire.

## what if it's all bogus?
okay.

## hello?
it's for you.

## yeah?
sir.

## what do we do?
the exit procedure.

## that's right my friend, but owen is not here, is he?
and the rules clearly state that two senior technicians have to be present at all exit procedures.

## we?
yes.

## when will you let them know?
as soon as we're done with this.

## all right?
okay.

## what do i do?
just follow my lead.

## please state your name.
hello?

## who are you?
he doesn't recognise your voice.

## please answer yes or no.
do you believe in god?

## what kind of god would do this to people?
please answer yes or no.

## i need a doctor.
okay?

## what does it do?
he...

## what happens if you push yes?
owen is...

## you sure?
yes.

## what are you doing?
you're not allowed in there.

## may we?
the boys upstairs felt you could perhaps use a hand, and so, here we are.

## yes mr. codd?
it's dodd, sir.

## what do...?
yes i almost forgot i have your orders from upstairs.

## you do know what that means?
yes, sir.

## have we got a visual yet?
still working on it, sir.

## do you think it means anything?
i don't know.

## do they have to?
she can't be that far.

## that we'll cut our losses?
uh, guys.

## are we sure this room is safe?
maybe he just starved to death.

## what are you doing?
we could use these.

## it's true isn't it?
i mean they now put bio receivers in all you army boys.

## is she all right?
she's not moving.

## are you all right?
rise and shine...

## is she...?
there's a pulse.

## can you hear me?
oh my god.

## what happened to you?
idont know.

## nothing.
why, you think...?

## what do you mean?
i think whatever was eating away at her, is spreading to him.

## what?
your face.

## you wanna baby sit a dead man?
be my guest.

## anything?
from now on, you test the rooms.

## who the hell are you?
i...

## problem, mr. scrod?
no problem sir.

## anything of interest?
actually sir, i was about to...

## would you care to share with the rest of the class?
yes sir.

## who says they only hire the mentally challenged down here?
open.

## i always assumed that it was so they could have a blank slate to work with.
why can't we remember anything?

## blank slate?
bastards, you've been using us as lab rats.

## you're job?
how can you do this to people.

## and you believed them?
well it was either this or execution so...

## what?
they say you're all condemned prisoners, who volunteer for the experiment instead of facing the death penalty.

## while you were doing your system checks, did you happen to see a little girl?
no.

## what?
yeah.

## they can see into our dreams?
yeah.

## why?
i can show you the exits.

## go ahead, where are they?
you were wrong about the cube.

## how do we get to that one?
i don't know.

## can you show us how to avoid the traps?
yes, definitely.

## mr. finn, could you do something about that, please?
yes, sir.

## the hell...?
damn.

## what is it?
the letters.

## what?
they're all gone.

## let's make their life a little more interesting, shall we?
okay...

## now what?
really glad you showed up to help.

## you know what?
i think we should keep getting together and doing this more often.

## what?
sir.

## sir?
you heard the man.

## now what do we do?
i don't know.

## what the hell?
i don't know sir, we suddenly lost contact.

## why?
maybe the energy required for the test itself blew out the capacitor.

## what?
i have no idea.

## you wouldn't lie to me, now would you mr. clodd?
no sir.

## excuse me, sir.
questions?

## for the love of god, where do they find these people?
i don't think it's software, sir.

## okay?
i needn't remind you gentlemen, that in a few minutes we'll have no choice but to send people in there.

## what the hell is going on?
boot.

## power went out?
yeah.

## what's the bad news?
it's gone into reset mode.

## is that as bad as it sounds?
the clean sweep program flash incinerates anything still living in all the rooms.

## which way do we go?
i don't know.

## dodd is the only one who can power down this quickly.
so i guess we just keep going in the same direction until we get to the edge, right?

## but he knows that reset would kick in, so why would he...?
of course.

## what?
quick.

## may i have that widget back, please?
i don't think i can do that, sir.

## mr. dodd, are you disobeying a direct order?
yes.

## anyone?
that the central coupling.

## is he not?
yes sir, that would be haskell, the big fellow.

## and they still bio chip the enlisted men, do they not?
of course.

## neuro cam enhancers, amplified.
time?

## are we there yet?
almost.

## okay, come on.
haskell?

## how much further?
sir, we've got the grid display back.

## did we get them?
845 01:22:39, 227 > 01:22:42, 617 sorry sir.

## what are you doing?
well, we've decided on a few modifications before putting you back inside.

## you have already made your choice.
don't i get a choice?

## i believe this is your signature?
i don't understand.

## chickliss?
all lab rats.

## where is she?
oh, the allusive ms. rains.

## wanna tell me where we're going, sayid?
it's better that you see it for yourself.

## open mind about what?
my god.

## what is this thing?
exactly.

## you mind?
sulu over here is packing a suitcase full of salted fish.

## do you?
doesn't matter what i know, i built it.

## sorry?
michael just told me you were jockeying for my spot on the raft.

## yeah?
yeah.

## your only chance of running's getting on that raft, ain't it?
lf we get picked up by a ship, when they come back to rescue the rest of y'all, gonna be a nice big asterisk next to your name.

## so, what were you and sawyer arguing about?
i told him something he didn't want to hear.

## when we get rescued, we're gonna come back for everybody else, right?
yeah.

## can't we fly around and look for it?
absolutely.

## dad?
ooh.

## what's the matter?
three weeks, give or take.

## all due respect, jack, but since when do i report to you?
all due respect, john, but you lied.

## how long did you have that case full of guns before you decided the rest of us needed to know?
you used your best discretion.

## you want to open it?
yeah.

## you notice anything about this hatch?
there's no handle.

## could the reason for that be more obvious?
maybe it was never meant to be opened from the outside.

## what'd you eat today?
fruit, fish.

## drinking enough water?
two, three bottles.

## where are you getting that water from?
the caves, like everybody else.

## you try not to move too much, okay?
we have to launch that raft tomorrow.

## hello?
hey, adam.

## hey, listen, can you carve out some time for me on the mrl?
yeah, it's... it's a favor for a friend of a friend.

## how old is he?
twenty two months next week.

## where is she?
she's over in cedar rapids visiting her folks.

## what?
you know what.

## heatstroke?
no.

## raw fish?
michael and jin are on the same diet.

## so you think it was the water?
no, i don't think it was the water.

## feeling any better?
cramps are quieting down.

## you and locke kiss and make up?
good.

## what?
drink from that one.

## somebody did this to me?
i don't know.

## michael and jin getting along?
they fight like a married couple building a raft together.

## you told him?
he thinks sawyer might've done it.

## kate?
yeah, i guess she wants on the raft.

## why would kate poison michael?
well, you know, the whole fugitive thing.

## how am i supposed to keep straight who knows what?
steve didn't know about the polar bear.

## what did she do?
i don't know.

## you didn't think the others should know about this?
discretion, john.

## so, what's the first thing you're gonna do when we get rescued?
you know, i don't really know.

## how's michael?
he's gonna be fine.

## ls somebody gonna be taking his place on the raft?
i don't know.

## what?
he's not sick.

## do you really think i'm capable of that?
i don't know what you're capable of.

## you brought beer?
no self respecting man in lowa goes anywhere without beer.

## is it on?
because it's cool, katie.

## how do you know we'll be together?
you'll be a mom

## funny how things turn out, huh?
yeah.

## what happened?
i had a little accident.

## does it hurt?
yep.

## something you wanna tell me, walt?
i didn't do it.

## didn't do what?
i didn't tell on you before, and i'm not gonna now.

## what's the matter?
don't open it.

## what did you say?
don't open it, mr. locke.

## wouldn't want our pilot out of commission before takeoff.
what?

## what?
you're off the raft.

## come again?
you're off the raft.

## i did what now?
get your hands off me, boy.

## run off with a new identity before half the reporters in the world descend on this damn island?
she might poison the captain himself.

## mom?
it's me, katie.

## katherine?
i'm her daughter.

## what happened?
i need your car keys.

## katie?
oh, god.

## you wanna tell us the truth?
yes.

## you don't want him to go, do you?
no.

## ls that why you tried to make him sick?
michael and jin working together all the time, pretty easy for them to get their water bottles mixed up.

## are you gonna tell the others?
i don't see any reason why they need to know.

## are you here to say sorry, sawyer?
sorry don't suit me.

## i cornered you?
you said if you wanted my spot, you were gonna take it.

## why is it so important for you to be on that raft?
be safe, sawyer.

## you getting better?
yeah.

## why should you be punished?
you were only trying to help me.

## you are confused, aren't you?
frightened.

## who is this?
i am a doctor.

## do you understand me?
no, i don't.

## what the hell is going on here?
there are people coming for you even as we speak.

## are you there?
it's right there in black and white, mr murdoch.

## mr murdoch, yes, where is he?
he just left not 5 minutes ago.

## please, won't you come in?
you must be emma murdoch.

## what is this?
a rather crude experiment designed to further my studies.

## john told you what happened?
yes.

## when was the last time that you saw him?
3 weeks ago.

## it is mr murdoch, isn't it?
j. murdoch.

## jerry?
no.

## how's it going?
hi.

## oh, when did i do that?
when you was last here.

## when was that?
when you left your wallet.

## you expect me to remember?
hello.

## where you headed, chief?
home.

## haven't you mugs got anything better to do?
well, i'm just trying to do my job, may.

## maybe you should be out looking for him instead of cooling your heels, huh?
aw, go on, get out of here.

## 6 hookers in all?
i believe so, sir.

## so, husselbeck, what kind of killer do you think stops to save a dying fish?
you've got me, sir.

## bumstead, what took you?
this killer's been running circles around us, thanks to walenski.

## what was that?
walenski.

## where do you begin?
everything detective walenski committed to paper should be here.

## do these names mean anything to you?
no.

## are you going to accuse him of something?
maybe murder.

## which one?
all of them.

## i hope you're still breathing.
have we met before?

## what's your name, honey?
john.

## how do you know i'm not the killer?
you don't seem like the killer type.

## you feeling any urges i should know about?
aw, shoot.

## we might ask the same question, yes?
sleep now.

## what is to be done?
this man is dangerous.

## what has the doctor to say about this?
he has failed to report in.

## and mr quick?
no more mr quick.

## should we not know, mr hand?
we had hoped to learn more before sharing with you.

## i found these keys in my pocket, so i assume i live here.
are you punishing me?

## supposed to be?
john.

## you really... don't know who i am, do you?
your doctor called me.

## my doctor?
yeah.

## why was i seeing a doctor?
i was frightened.

## must we reproduce mr murdoch's memories again?
i tried to imprint him, but he woke up.

## he has no memories, then?
only fragments.

## you have had strays before, right?
this is no stray, doctor.

## you will process another template of the subject's memories, yes?
of course.

## we'll talk again after tonight's tuning, but no more delays, yes?
no more inconsistencies in your behaviour.

## you do?
the car outside, the one you arrived in.

## stand aside, will you, please?
we're almost there, buddy.

## hey, you happen to know the way to shell beach?
you're kidding.

## how is he?
the same.

## what happened then, eddie?
nothing happened, frank.

## do you think about the past much, frank?
as much as the next guy.

## you saw something, didn't you, eddie?
something to do with the case.

## a catalogue of conquests?
i don't know.

## that's the purpose of your little zoo, isn't it?
it is time.

## why is everyone asleep?
shh.

## what have you done to me?
nothing, nothing.

## i did that?
listen to me, john.

## yes?
yes.

## an opposing influence on the machines?
then this man murdoch is more powerful than we thought.

## how will his imprint allow us to find him?
everywhere he goes, everyone he seeks out will be known to us.

## ls it done?
oh, yes, mr book.

## brings back memories, doesn't it?
stop by sometime.

## can you tell me the way to avenue c?
try the subway.

## you, uh, been working here long?
25 years, no days off for good behaviour.

## all change?
excuse me.

## how do i get to the end of the line?
that's the express.

## there's no way out, you know?
you can't get out of the city.

## you're murdoch, aren't you?
the one they've been looking for.

## who are you?
used to be a cop.

## they steal people's memories, you know?
then they swap them around between us.

## how do you know all this?
once in a while, one of us wakes up while they're changing things.

## i'm sorry?
to be able to revisit those places which have meant so very much to us.

## where is your husband now?
i wish i knew.

## what brings you here?
i met my wife at this place.

## what are you doing here?
wait.

## ls that me?
yeah.

## shell beach is where i grew up?
that's what i said.

## how do i get there?
i don't know.

## where are they now?
they're dead, johnny.

## what's the scar?
you burnt your arm pretty bad in the fire.

## i can't remember when she gave it to me.
what does it mean, johnny?

## what's happening, lnspector?
i'm not sure i know anymore.

## you can sleep here tonight, huh?
glad to have you back, johnny, even if it is for just a night.

## ls that the right time?
why, sure.

## what do you think, johnny?
i don't understand.

## how'd i miss it?
you're tired.

## hello?
emma, he's here.

## what are you talking about?
we fashioned this city on stolen memories, different eras, different pasts, all rolled into one.

## learn what?
about you, mr murdoch, you and your fellow inhabitants, what makes you human.

## what are you?
she was alive when i left her.

## what about this?
this is nothing.

## what pictures?
i don't understand this.

## you think it makes sense to me?
i'm as much in the dark here as you are.

## you heard of a place called shell beach?
sure.

## know how to get there?
yeah.

## can you tell me?
right.

## hmm?
wait.

## what do you mean?
i just mean... during the day.

## when was the last time you remember seeing it?
and i'm not talking about some distant, half forgotten childhood memory.

## you know something?
i don't think the sun even... exists... in this place.

## i know this is gonna sound crazy, but what if we never knew each other before now?
someone just wants us to think it did.

## but how can that be true?
i so vividly remember meeting you.

## sir?
detective walenski killed himself last night.

## how can we help you, sir?
you can sleep.

## don't you think it's about time you started giving me some answers?
yes.

## won't you please sit down?
l i come here quite often.

## what do they want from me?
right.

## you're kidding me, right?
we're running out of time, john.

## let's go, doctor.
doctor?

## where are we going?
shell beach.

## that's where you want to go, isn't it?
they'll be waiting for us.

## who are you people?
we must go to the end of the canal.

## will a man, given the history of a killer, continue in that vein, or are we, in fact, more than the mere sum of our memories?
this business of you being a killer was an unhappy coincidence.

## why are they doing all of this?
it is our capacity for individuality, our souls that makes us different from them.

## they're dying, you see?
their entire race is on the brink of extinction.

## where do i fit in?
you are different, john.

## so why do they need you?
when they first brought us here, they extracted what was in us.

## what about my childhood?
shell beach, uncle karl.

## you say they brought us here.
what about this?

## from where?
you see, i have become the monster you were intended to be.

## john?
they want to imprint you with their own collective memories.

## you control their machines.
what have you done?

## where's emma?
she is not emma anymore, john.

## what are you going to do now, john?
i'm gonna fix things.

## you told me i had the power, didn't you?
i can make these machines do anything i want.

## where are you going?
shell beach.

## what's the fare?
quarter.

## what are you doing?
i'm just making a few little changes around here is all.

## are we sure that's what we want?
i'm prepared to take my chances.

## do you know if shell beach is around here?
i think that's it just over there.

## would you like to join me?

## and where do you think it comes from?
through this piece of glass.

## don't they ever cut your hair in that darn orphanage?
i like it the way it is.

## lemme go, will ya?
anyway... about the refracted light.

## you see the shape of this crystal?
that is a prism.

## you understand?
what he means is... the sun comes through here and paints a rainbow.

## can i try it once, please?
go ahead, but don't break anything.

## do you know mrs snow?
well, i've just come from her place.

## oh, we could, could we?
do you kids think...

## i've got nothing better to do than to play silly games?

## not bad, is it?
it's not bad at all.

## no.

i just wonder if folks would buy a thing like this.

## well, where have you been, you naughty girl?
oh, i'm sorry.

## that's right.
how do you do?

## why not?
because because of your aunt, that's why not.

## well, we do, don't we, mr murg?
indeed we do.

## does she have to be here?
go on into the kitchen and talk to mildred.

## why don't you go outside and play?
hush up.

## the what game?
she's been pestering folks all over town with this sunshine and happiness thing.

## and you know what?
i found a reason for being glad.

## she's serious about it, isn't she?
just a moment.

## you're getting paid, aren't you?
not to be kicked.

## will you let it go at that, karl?
i just can't show up at your affair.

## what do you mean by that?
well, i just came from your newspaper office.

## what's the matter with those fellows?
they said they couldn't handle this ad for our bazaar.

## will you go over and straighten them out?
ah, take it easy, doc.

## we can't afford to antagonize her.
why lie to the man?

## can't afford to antagonize her?
just don't be surprised if come sunday night nobody shows up at your bazaar.

## charlie?
he knew no one would cooperate without me.

## won't let your guard down for a minute, will you?
still suspicious.

## nothing's changed, has it, polly?
you're still as opinionated as ever, if that's what you mean.

## would you like to be paid for your diagnosis?
this one's on the house.

## ma'am?
see that the flowers in the conservatory get fresh water.

## did ya hear how he told her off?
stubborn, mule headed woman. just like her father.

## what did she say?
a lot of foolish nonsense.

## what's the matter?
oh, nothing.

## is the bazaar off?
it looks that way.

## why?
you wouldn't understand.

## is it because of aunt polly?
yes.

## yes?
she doesn't own the church.

## what did you say?
um, i just said that nobody could own a church.

## now, what has she got to do with this?
she said nobody could own a church.

## what are you doing here?
aunt polly sent me.

## it's a lovely day, isn't it?
oh, nothing.

## now, what is it?
uh, i don't know.

## would you like someone to practise your sermon on?
no.

## now, why would you ask a thing like that?
oh, the way you looked just then reminded me of my father.

## and what did he say?
oh.

## tell me, did your father ever solve the problem?
well, he read something one day that he said helped him.

## in the bible?
no, just something he read someplace.

## may i?
when you look for the bad in mankind expecting to find it... you surely will.

## the texts?
yes.

## did you know that?
no, i didn't know that.

## dear, are you all right?
i don't know.

## where's pollyanna, please?
she's gotta be there.

## couldn't you bring her?
you'll fall.

## are you sure it's safe?
i'm sure it's safe.

## i say, isn't that good?
yes, it is.

## right this way, ladies and gentlemen.
isn't that fine?

## will you go and get into your costume?
they're waiting for you.

## they're waiting for you.
now, who do you suppose this is?

## uhh, quilt?
well, i'll take it to the quilt stand.

## can i have more?
you finish those first, then you can come back and have some more.

## pollyanna, will you hurry up?
everyone else is dressed and waiting for you.

## do you know what you want?
all right.

## what we gonna get there?
come on.

## oh, how did they know?
right here step right up well, reverend.

## what about it?
here.

## what is it, ma'am?
i thought i heard something.

## pollyanna!
eh, how is the child?

## i can see it in your eyes.
want to?

## they blame me, don't they?
no.

## it's true, isn't it?
i could have been the least bit understanding.

## and if he were merciful, why did he let her come to our town?
let me tell you something, polly harrington.

## now, you understand everything i told you, don't you, dear?
and there's nothing to be afraid of.

## what is it, edmond?
i told pollyanna about her injury.

## don't you, dear?
we're going to take you to baltimore for an operation so you can walk again.

## you hear that, honey?
i know.

## why don't we all cheer up?
let's see if we can't find something to be glad about your staying in bed.

## did you know that your aunt ordered it for you?
go ahead, darling.

## please?
put these in too, mr thomas.

## is the operation dangerous?
yes, it's very delicate.

## you're coming, aren't you?
i need your permission to operate.

## time?
there is no time.

## hope?
what she really needed was love.

## what are you talking about?
a a across the lawns and the flowers.

## oh, the heck with it.
been trying to tell me what?

## what is it you want?
we don't want anything.

## why don't you tell her yourself?
open the doors, nancy.

## come in, won't you?
nice to see you.

## how are you, mr neely?
i'm just fine.

## how are you today?
hello.

## won't you come in?
oh, what beautiful flowers.

## you gonna greet them with that mopey old face of yours?
i don't wanna see anyone.

## you get well now, you hear?
it's not charity. just a gift, eh, from one friend to another.

## it's gorgeous.
take a look at this, will ya?

## isn't it?
and we're gonna wait for you.

## shall we tell her now, jimmy?
i've been adopted.

## who do you think?
you hurry home and help.

## aunt polly?
bye bye.

## but why does he want to see me?
he has never bothered about me.

## does that mean so little to you, viridiana?
i have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...

## do you like that rope i gave you?
it's easier to jump with, it's got handles.

## how are you uncle?
i'm well...

## what was the journey like?
excellent.

## how long are you staying?
i've been given permission to stay only a few days.

## was that difficult to get?
no.

## did you have so little interest in seeing me?
to tell you the truth, not very much.

## unfortunately, it's too late now, isn't it?
my maid ramona's daughter.

## how are we today?
today, a good girl.

## could i trouble you for my glass of milk?
certainly, miss.

## is that difficult?
not at all.

## how did you see me?
from the terrace.

## coming to the hen house with me?
no, i don't want to.

## what do you mean?
nothing.

## i can't keep things to myself.
you don't trust me, do you?

## how did you know about that?
i heard my mother talking about it once.

## but is it true?
yes, it is.

## what do you know about life?
you couldn't possibly understand.

## and this innocent child?
don't worry.

## is she up yet?
she's been up for some time.

## why don't you ask her to stay on for a few days?
i have asked her but she's ungrateful.

## what's the matter?
sit down.

## you like me, don't you?
i'd be really ungrateful, if i didn't.

## how far are you prepared to help me?
just say the word, sir, and i'll do anything.

## why don't you speak to her, ramona?
women are good at that sort of thing.

## why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her?
you're right, but we must do something.

## this one, sir?
yes, leave it there.

## why didn't you wake me?
they say it's dangerous.

## why?
it's no more odd than anything else.

## you'll do what i ask, then?
whatever you wish.

## wasn't that cowardice?
no, it isn't that.

## you're really serious?
yes.

## why are you crying?
i'm afraid.

## then how did it get in, silly?
he came in through the cupboard.

## what are you doing?
don jaime was kissing the lady.

## don't i kiss you?
you should be in bed.

## how do you feel?
i have a headache.

## what happened to me?
you fainted last night after supper.

## have i slept long?
you slept well, don't worry.

## don't you understand that i want to get dressed?
i forgot everything because of you, even the passion that has kept me going all these years.

## explain everything to her seriously.
what did you say to her, sir?

## what for?
she'll only look at me that way again...

## but what can i say to her, sir?
tell her i lied, that i didn't take advantage of her.

## you believe me, don't you?
you cannot leave...

## why not?
there's been an accident.

## where?
come with me.

## you weren't expecting me, were you?
mother.

## why didn't you write?
i would have come immediately.

## do you know the reason?
i want a complete confession from you.

## is there some grave impediment which prevents you from taking your vows?
there must be something.

## what great plans are you thinking of dedicating yourself to now?
i know my own weakness, and whatever i do will be humble.

## why isn't she coming?
she has already crossed herself.

## are you ready?
when you are, miss.

## are you the other two?
yes, miss, that's us, yes.

## why did he acknowledge me at the last moment?
he was very good.

## why did he kill himself?
i don't know, sir.

## i'm not like him, am i?
not in that way.

## why do you say that?
i know what i mean.

## aren't you happy?
yes.

## how many floors are there?
two.

## are there many windows?
lots.

## have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?
they shut all right now.

## are you jorge?
jorge, don jaime's son, at your service.

## well now, even the servants put on airs here.
what's your name?

## what's going on, moncho?
this louse is looking for trouble.

## would you mind telling me what i did to deserve your insults?
i've had a gutful of this.

## are you tired?
i nearly walked my legs off today.

## why don't you let me do that, miss?
because i've got him into bad habits.

## what's the matter with you?
nothing.

## why the bad temper?
it's viridiana.

## do you know what i think?
what's annoying you is that she pays so little attention to you.

## he has the devil in him.
so you didn't come from the poorhouse?

## when it itches, how does he manage to scratch when he can't see?
tell him his mother comes to scratch me.

## have you eaten well?
i don't want to criticize the saintly miss who is so good to us, but i would take the liberty of saying that the beans were acid.

## what does that mean?
sour, idiot.

## what about you, manuel?
i'm only good at making people laugh.

## are you sure it isn't contagious?
they told me it isn't at the hospital.

## who's there?
jorge.

## well... is it so urgent?
yes.

## what's the matter?
i want to put in some electricity.

## is that everything?
no it isn't, there's much more.

## what do you know about me?
i know that you used to work with an architect.

## i'd like to ask you, miss, to pose...
and do you know that i lived with my mother?

## me?
just so the virgin can be really pretty.

## do you have great devotion for the virgin?
i'm not a bigot, miss, but everybody has his own beliefs... and then... with this terrible thing... if i didn't have faith...

## did you sleep well, miss?
yes.

## i'm very sorry for you.
why?

## have you any other children?
no, miss, it will be the first.

## could they bring me some tobacco?
smoking makes him spit and feel ill.

## how much is that?
fifteen yards.

## that's fifteen by seven?
good.

## then let him go and he'll follow you.
now that the wagon's empty, why don't you let him ride?

## and let him get run over by somebody else?
i'll buy him.

## how much do you want for him?
if you want...

## let's go, don't be afraid.
what's he called?

## have you thought of what you want planted yet?
the fields have been left so long, with a good manuring anything will grow.

## and the orchards?
that's good land.

## have you come to look at the work?
i've told you before i'm not interested in this.

## what are you doing here?
get out.

## do they worry you that much, then?
they worry me a great deal.

## is that all you're going to devote your life to?
i don't know what's going on.

## how are you today?
things seem to be getting better.

## wake me up tomorrow morning.
are your parents alive?

## what are you going to do?
you, on the other hand...

## what are you thinking about?
that your cousin is more to your taste.

## how in hell does it wind up?
that's life.

## what can we do, if that's the way it happens?
tonight, but i'll be back tomorrow afternoon.

## are they going to work here too?
don't worry.

## do you intend to stay here for some time?
yes.

## why?
you can come and live again in the big house.

## and your friend?
she's left.

## is she coming back?
no.

## why does any man leave a woman?
he's coming to live with me.

## and this chest?
just some old curtains and drapes.

## did he ever mention me?
i can't remember.

## why?
you wouldn't be here otherwise.

## what are these sacks doing here?
i don't know.

## and those?
that's sand.

## do you know something, ramona?
if you took some trouble, you'd be quite pretty.

## what more do you want?
let's sit down a moment.

## are we leaving?
don jorge said he'd be waiting for you at the lawyer's at four o'clock.

## do you want anything else?
bring me a flute if you see one.

## you'd like me to kill them?
with the life that's ahead of them... they'd be better off being sent to paradise.

## what do you think of that?
i'll go along with it... if it's being respectful enough.

## what will the lady say?
she won't even know.

## didn't you say you know how to make vanilla pudding?
you keep quiet.

## how did you get in there?
through a back window.

## where are you going?
come here, there're wonderful things inside.

## what are you called?
fold it up, you're going to spoil it.

## how did you know?
the noise of the money in his pocket gave him away.

## one of them said i was...
you know what i did?

## why are you screaming?
don't you touch my little girl.

## yes?
enedina's going to take a picture.

## where's the camera?
it's a present from my parents.

## what is it?
come.

## what?
enedina and paco.

## what about them?
they're playing games behind the couch.

## which couch?
take me to them and i'll kill him.

## holy virgin, how can we clean up this mess?
things are going to be worse than the cuban war.

## but as it is, why?
you're quite right, old dear.

## didn't you hear me?
beat it.

## why?
jorge.

## if you help me, you'll be a rich man.
why all the fuss?

## there's plenty of money in this house.
me, rich?

## where?
if i don't keep my word, you can kill me.

## where's the dough?

these here are friends of ray brenner's.

## are you nuts?
man said he didn't want me to smoke.

## what about my van?
you can file a complaint with the sheriff.

## sheriff, why don't you ask them what they're doing with the van?
found it off the road up at cutter's way.

## disappeared?
yeah, he was in the woods up north and just never got back.

## how can an entire town let them get away with something like that?
because we know they're crazy.

## what are you gonna do?
i figure their time's about up.

## yeah, well, where is he?
we said two hours.

## what are you gonna do, old man?
dad, it's okay.

## look, leave him alone, okay?
let him finish.

## don't we get the message, murdock?
i want that.

## guess what's missing.
now, where's our stuff?

## it's those maniacs.
looking for these?

## amy, what are we gonna do?
anything we can to keep those creeps from getting their hands on us.

## why don't i pay more attention when the guys do this?
here.

## do you have any bullets?

i think so.

## the rest?
yeah.

## what are you talking about?
you forgot to check the oil.

## hey, man, why you always trying your crazy logic on me when bad things keep happening to us?
dead men tell no tales.

## now, trish, you sure you're gonna be all right?
this is a pretty big place for a woman alone.

## what happened to dr ikuma?
he died right after the place was sold.

## what?
that means that she was alive down there the entire time...

## what happens in it?
i've heard that it's a creepy woman who tells you that you will die in one week's time.

it was just there.

## how can you tell that it's that tape?

## why not?
i just wouldn't.

she was with tomoko when she died.

## what was it?
a well.

## was that it?
yes.

## you've seen it too, haven't you?
you'll be all right, if that's all.

yes.

## don't you trust me?

just before you could see the well.

## where's the tape now?
i got rid of it.

## him, too?
just like the girl.

## we didn't save yoichi?
your child isn't yoichi anymore.

the kid turned out to be a rat.

## would you have a problem going with anthony to take care of that?
no, not at all.

## don't i have some kind of contact with them?
no.

## you mean to tell me...... if something happens to my parents and they get sick, i can't see them?
maybe something can be worked out if they're sick.

## you need henry, not me, right?
that's right.

## i mean, what goes on?

## do you see him here in this courtroom?
yes.

## will you please point him out for the jury?
let the record show that mr. hill identified the defendant, james conway.

## do you see him in the courtroom?
yes.

## can you point him out for the jury?
look, there's ben affleck.

## or was it real?
it was election night 2000 and everything seemed to be going as planned.

## how does someone like bush get away with something like this?
well first, it helps if your brother is the governor of the state in question.

## is the objection signed by a senator?
unfortunately, mr. president, it is not signed by one single senator.

## is the objection, uh, in writing and signed by a member of the house and a senator?
the objection is in writing, and i don't care that it is not, it is not signed by a member of the senate.

## what are you doing the rest of the day?
these matters.

## anyone want some grits?
relaxing at camp david.

## you suppose he's pretty confident on those numbers on iraqi security forces?
make me look young.

## should he have held at least one meeting since taking office to discuss the threat of terrorism with his head of counter terrorism?
or maybe mr. bush was wondering why he had cut terrorism funding from the fbl.

## or was it the saudis?
damn, it was them.

## but really, who wanted to fly?
no one.

## you mean osama has had contact with other family members?
that's right.

## bin ladens?
that's right.

## here?
in america.

## did the authorities do anything when the bin ladens tried to leave the country?
no, they were identified at the airport, they looked at their passports, and they were identified.

## and who authorized it?
try to imagine what those poor bastards were feeling when they jumped outta that building to their death.

## and if i had to inconvenience a member of the bin laden family with a subpoena or a grand jury do you think i'd lose any sleep over it?
not for a minute, mike.

## not even the biggest civil libertarians?
no, no.

## bandar, do you know the bin laden family?
i do very well.

## what are they like?
they're really lovely human beings ; uh, he is the only one i never, i don't know well.

## what was the circumstance under which you met him?
he came to thank me for my efforts to bring the americans, our friends, to help us against the atheists, he said the communists.

## he came to thank you for helping bring america to help him?
and now he may be responsible for bombing america.

## what do you make of him when you met him?
i was not impressed, to be honest with you.

## is that what he was thinking about?
because if the public knew this it wouldn't look very good.

## why didn't bush want the press and public to see bath's name on his military records?
bush and bath had become good friends when they both served in the texas national guard.

## but the question has always been where did this money come from?
now his dad was rich.

## whenever they got into trouble there were these angel investors who flowed money into the companies.
so where did george w. bush get his money?

## bush visits saudi arabia on behalf of carlyle and meets with the royal family and meets with the bin laden family.
so the question is why would saudis with all the oil in the world go around the globe to invest in this lousy oil company?

## who's your daddy?
because that's how much the saudi royals and their associates have given the bush family.

## or me?
now, after 9/ 11, it was an embarrassment and they preferred that no one ask any questions.

## this commission?
testify, i mean, i'd be glad to visit with them.

## wow.
the lawyers the saudi defense minister hired to fight the 9/ 11 families?

## how much money do the saudis have invested in america, roughly?
uh, i've heard figures inside of $860 billion dollars.

## and uh, what percentage of our economy is that?
that seems like a lot.

## what would happen if like one day they just pulled that trillion dollars out?
a trillion dollars, that would be an enormous blow to the economy.

## could i speak with you for a moment please, sir?
uh yeah, sure.

## steve with the secret service.
good, how are you doing?

## we're just ascertaining information regarding, are you making a documentary regarding the saudi arabian embassy?
uh, no.

## george bush invited bandar bush to the white house for a private dinner and talk.
no no, do they give you any trouble?

## why would bandar's government block american investigators from talking to the relatives of the fifteen hijackers?
the two of them rocked out on the truman balcony so that bandar could smoke a cigar and have a drink.

## the president, in a very intimidating way,
on that day, what did the president say to you?

## did he ask about any other nations other than iraq?
no.

## and were his questions more about iraq than about al qaeda?
absolutely.

## who in their right mind would do that?
nice shot.

## or was the war in afghanistan really about something else?
perhaps the answer was in houston, texas.

## and who got a caspian sea drilling contract the same day unocal signed the pipeline deal?
halliburton.

## here is the taliban official visiting our state department to meet with us officials.
and who else stood to benefit from the pipeline?

## who was hamid karzai?
he was a former advisor to unocal.

## oh, and the taliban?
uh, they mostly got away.

## what kinda president was he?
i'm a war president.

## how?
there's nothing specific to report.

## fear works?
fear does work, yes.

## and how do you make them afraid?
we are gonna win florida.

## is the objection signed by a member of the senate?
not signed by a member of the senate.

## is the objection signed by a senator?
unfortunately, mr. president, it is not signed by one single senator.

## is the objection in writing...... and signed by a member of the house and a senator?
the objection is in writing, and i don't care...... that it is not signed by a member of the senate.

## what about these folks that say that you're taking too long of a vacation?
they don't understand the definition of work, then.

## is this to destiny and bubba?
yeah.

## what are you doing the rest of the day?
karen hughes is coming over.

## behave yourself, will you?
make me look young.

## osama has had contact with other family members?
right.

## bin ladens?
that's right.

## here?
in america.

## that's the proper procedure?
yeah.

## did the authorities do anything when the bin ladens tried to leave?
no.

## what else?
if you hear anything, let us know.

## how long?
you've got time.

## who authorized it?
lmagine what those poor bastards were feeling...

## you know, you got a lawyer?
fine.

## counsel?
i do, very well.

## what are they like?
they're really lovely human beings.

## what was the circumstance under which you met?
this is ironic.

## isn't it ironic?
he came to thank you for helping bring america to help him.

## what did you make of him?
i was not impressed.

## not impressed?
no.

## the question is, why would saudis, who had all the oil in the world...... go around the globe to invest in this lousy oil company?
access is power.

## or is he representing both?
this company is about money, not conspiracies to run the world...... or engineer political maneuvering and things like that.

## this commission?
you know, i don't...

## testify?
i'd be glad to visit with them.

## how much money do the saudis have invested in america, roughly?
i've heard figures as high as $860 billion.

## eight hundred and sixty billion?
billion.

## and what percentage of our economy does that represent?
it seems like a lot.

## a trillion dollars?
that would be an enormous blow to the economy.

## good, how you doing?
steve kimball with the secret service.

## are you doing a documentary on the saudi arabian embassy?
no.

## is that...?
no, that's fine.

## saudis?
no comment on that.

## on that day, what did the president say to you?
they planned to do something about iraq before they came into office.

## did he ask about any other nations other than iraq?
no, not at all.

## were his questions more about iraq than al qaeda?
absolutely.

## and the reaction you got from the defense secretary, rumsfeld...... from his assistant, paul wolfowitz?
nice shot.

## how?
there's nothing specific to report.

## could these cattle be a target for terrorists?
fear works.

## and how do you make them afraid?
well, you make them afraid by creating an aura of endless threat.

## how high do you have to be in the building...... for that chute to actually take effect?
you only have to be on the 10th floor or above.

## they can put this on themselves?
right.

## is this something that you honestly think, in a moment of panic...... that someone can operate properly?
oh, yeah.

## what did the fbi tell you?
well, they contacted me by phone.

## is there any target around here?
not that we can think of.

## do you feel extra suspicious of outsiders?
oh, everybody does that.

## do you think they could be a terrorist?
never know what's gonna happen.

## that correct?
i've told him at least on two occasions.

## is that correct?
that is correct.

## and they weren't there to jazzercise.
i feel my rights have been, you know, trampled on.

## how could congress pass this patriot act without even reading it?
sit down, my son.

## do you really know what that would entail...... if we were to read every bill that we passed?
well, the good thing, it would slow down the legislative process.

## what would you like?
right behind you.

## i can bring that on the plane?
actually, yes, you're fine.

## matches and lighters on the plane?
hey, no problem.

## or was something else going on?
this is where the pacific ocean meets the shores of oregon.

## how much time?
three minutes.

## what the hell do we do now?
the targeting capabilities and the care that goes into targeting...... is as impressive as anything anyone could see.

## you know?
and be faithful in what happens.

## do you trust this president?
yes, i do.

## and why shouldn't they?
he'd spent the better part of the last year...... giving them every reason why we should invade iraq.

## who's in that coalition of the willing?
you will find out who's in it.

## afghanistan?
oh, yeah.

## am i slanted and biased?
you damn well bet i am.

## but it's not that easy to conquer a country, is it?
the renewed battle for control of iraq raged for a fourth day today...... with street clashes in nearly every corner of the country.

## what's happened?
they attacked our convoy.

## you wanna give us your name?
hamill, thomas.

## with the war not going as planned...... and the military in need of many more troops...... where would they find the new recruits?
military experts say three times...... the 120, 000 u. s. troops now deployed...... would be needed to pacify and rebuild the country.

## you wanna talk about terrorism?
come right here.

## why do you always go for the underdog?
it was because the underdog is who needed me.

## anybody currently serving overseas?
a brother of mine.

you need to know discipline if you're gonna get into music.

## 10:00 monday morning?

## you want me to pick you up?
it's better to get them when they're in ones and twos...... and work on them that way.

## ladies, ready to join up?

yes, sir.

## you ever thought about being a marine, man?

## will they ever trust us again?
he had used weapons.

## otherwise, you're talking about a half hour or 45 minutes of diggin'.
otherwise, what's the point?

## and who knows who's gonna be comin' along in that time?
anywhere else in the country i was a bookie, a gambler... always lookin' over my shoulder, hassled by cops, day and night.

green's here about two or three times a month... and he's busy with real estate deals.

## so in green's absence, then, you're the boss?
i serve at the pleasure of the chairman of the board.

## so day to day, then, you're the boss?

## hmm, have you read this?

well, it's not necessarily true, mr. mcmurphy.

## how would it be if we had a vote...... and let the majority rule?

i went over to her house...... one sunday afternoon and...... and i brought her some flowers...

## why did you want to marry her?
well, i was in love with her.

## yes, mr. cheswick?
miss ratched...... i'd like to ask you a question, please.

## why can't we go on to some new business?
the business of this meeting, mr. cheswick...... is therapy.

## a baseball game?
you know, and i've never been to a baseball game and...... i think i'd like to see one.

## that would be good therapy, too, wouldn't it, miss ratched?
i thought we'd decided that issue.

## would one more vote satisfy you, mr. mcmurphy?
all right.

## are you trying to tell me that you're going to count these?
these poor sons of bitches, they don't know what we're talking about.

## right?
all right.

## want to watch the world series?
this could be a big moment for you.

## you want to watch baseball?
just raise that hand up.

## what do you say?
i gave it all to her.

## you're tired?
just raise your hand up, bancini.

## watch the ball game, huh?
i'm tired.

## what about you, pal?

## general, you remember, don't you?
october, the banner, the stars...

## want to watch the ball game, huh?

i think that you've been trying to put us on all this time.

## you know, what do you want me to do?
you know.

## christ!
yeah.

## does that mean something to you?
i'm not sure i understand what you mean.

## i'm smarter than him, ain't i?

## how did you feel about what happened yesterday?
you want to kill.

## do you gentlemen have any more questions?
i don't have any more, but perhaps you do.

## where do you suppose she lives?

you got beautiful hair.

## fishing don't grab you?
they do.

## understand?

## he's not crazy...... but he's dangerous.

## you don't think he's crazy?
no, he's not crazy.

## dr. songee?
i don't think he's overly psychotic.

## do you think he's dangerous?
absolutely so.

## well, john, what do you want to do with him?
i think we've had our turn.

## is there anybody that you have...... on your staff, that could...... relate to him?

## help him out with some of these problems?
the funny thing is that the person he's the closest to...... is the one he dislikes the most.

## come with me, huh?

## i'm voluntary here, see?
i'm not committed.

## you can go home anytime you want?
no, randall, he's telling you the truth.

## billy, for christ's sake, you must be committed, right?
you ought to be out in a convertible...... bird dogging chicks and banging beaver.

## crazy or something?
well, you're not.

## mr. scanlon?
i want to know why the dorm is locked in the daytime and on weekends.

## may i have my cigarettes, please, miss ratched?
you sit down, mr. cheswick, and wait your turn.

## may i have my cigarettes, please, miss ratched?

sit down, will you?

## i want to...
you remember that, don't you?

## give him a cigarette, will you, harding?
it's my last one.

## or even yours.

## best dog of the lot.
hi, how are you?

## here, how about a nice kitty?
dear god...

## so, this the big date?
there's no date.

## we'll have a good time, won't we?
yes.

## is she gonna do that all day?
ok, here come the videos.

## how do you know that guy?
gave him a tip on a horse.

## why?
we both know that you're a screw up, but lately...

## what did i promise you?
a concert, a picnic and a dance.

## so what about your father?
i've only heard you talk about your mom.

## celebrity apartments?
yeah.

## do celebrities live here?
yeah.

## you're not coming, are you?
tell me more about your father.

## so where's your dad?
i don't know.

## i never closed my eyes again.
where is he?

## and you never heard from him?
no, i never did.

## more company, tom?
i won't tell the enquirer.

## who's junior?
someone determined to ruin our evening.

## you want me to say you don't have a pot to piss in?
like they say, no good deed goes unpunished.

## would you mail this for me?
word is, you have a lot of pull with the man.

## would you?
we'll take care of it.

## why would they break my eggs?
it makes no sense.

## don't we know each other?
i don't think so.

## like me.
you?

## you like me?
no.

## he's dead?
i can't believe it.

## heart attack, right?
i knew he needed to lose a few pounds.

## i'm officially debt free?
right.

## you are kidding, right?
this is my greatest hustle of all time, webster.

## we're gonna start the dlo marching band?
no, it's for randy, the homeless guy.

## can we go again?
i have a hair issue.

## as a retired juggling motorbike hoodlum, what are you praying for?
i need a new hog.

## emanda?
among the usual holiday scenes, a wave of kindness is going on.

## $5, 000?
that could do somebody a lot of good.

## you be in charge of the money.
5, 000?

## so?
let me think about this.

## turn it in to the financial office?
if that's what you do.

## now?
now we hang low for a while.

## you think if you guys stop, the letters will stop?
we just got started here.

## ok, so we're clear?
low profile.

## you don't think god is really answering these letters?
i don't think so.

## you afraid you'll have to dress in black and pine away in front of the prison?
no, i just don't know how to bake a file into a bran muffin.

## did you guys know we was on tv?
they said we did 14 postal miracles since friday.

## don't you get it?
no.

## eye dris abraham?
idris.

## guy, what...?
this is great.

## how about that guy?
wait, i remember you.

## you remember that?
yeah.

## while i'm here, out of curiosity, how did that sermon on doubting thomas end?
well, you know, thomas found his belief again.

## the end?
he spent every rupee of the king's fortune feeding the poor.

## can you hold this, please?
well, look, the king let thomas go and thomas spent the rest of his happy life sacrificing for others.

## so thomas conned the king, right?
no.

## you still struggling?
every day.

## that's a big one, isn't it?
i can't believe i'm doing this.

## i mean, him?
a trumpet.

## you didn't hear?
no, he confessed.

## confessed to what?
he didn't do anything.

## now, tom, what do you think?
i think...

## mr turner?
yeah, they arrested the wrong man.

## really?
he wasn't involved in any of this.

## and how do you know this?
because i did it all.

## excuse me?
i did it all.

## mr bacon?
this court is now in session.

## when did you get out of the rubber bungalow?
good to see you.

## he knows you?
i used to live with him, in another life.

## does the defence have an opening statement?
not at this time.

## so you turned to tom turner?
well, no.

## can i have my son back now?
i've dealt with some of these attorneys.

## witnesses?
i don't even know where my lawyer is.

## why would a con like tom turner do good deeds?
think about it.

## did you talk them into this?
no.

## mr dooly, do you really expect us to believe you're the enforcer type?
yeah.

## wanna see me enforce something?
i'd like to enforce you.

## no?
ok.

## and you're going to heaven?
i believe in russian proverb.

## may i finish, please?
knock yourself out.

## is this going somewhere?
perhaps he does not live within lawyers.

## maybe the media?
maybe, i don't know, lex luthor.

## what the hell is going on?
now that i have your attention, mr banks, please proceed with a little more decorum, rather than this childish display of histrionics.

## what?
put your arm around me.

## rebecca?
yes.

## the government wishes to keep its focus on mr tom turner, despite the multitude of sins confessed to by his co workers.
will you stop the shaking?

## now, what do these co workers have in common?
all of them have worked at the post office for years without ever committing a crime.

## and what of the countless others who write to god every day?
there must be accountability here.

## dogs?
your honour, these are my witnesses for my closing argument.

## and rocky is a healthy little doggie, aren't you, sugars?
and that is his friend, taffy.

## can the dogs leave now, before there's an accident?
ok, everybody up.

## would you like to know why?
i'd like to know.

## speaking on his own behalf, may tom turner finish my closing argument?
roll the trucks.

## she's making tom speak?
yeah.

## i mean, how could people, especially people dealt such crummy, pathetic hands, have faith in anything or anyone?
i don't know how things got going, but it's not because i had some sort of noble intention.

## your honour, i lost my programme notes.
mr bacon, will you please see to it that all of the windows are tightly closed?

## is this where we all clap for tinker bell?
you're blessed with a con artist's gift of talking his way out of trouble.

## so how do i know if your words are sincere or if they're some cynical attempt to talk your way out of trouble?
i don't know.

## would somebody please tell me what is going on out there?
the federal courthouse is surrounded by what appears to be every mail truck in the southland.

## steep odds.
are you nuts?

## you bet the bailiff on the verdict?
just a silly side bet.

## where?
he's got a girl with him.

## really?
yeah.

## see?
so the trial of tom turner ended but the effects of the god squad linger through the holiday season and, hopefully, even longer.

## herman, how are you doing?
welcome back.

## why wouldn't you have?
and and the groundlings, very much aroused...

## hey, hey, motherfucker, are you deaf?
i didn't pay $1, 500 for both these seats... and flatten them watchamajiggem up here to see no king lear.

## what the fuck is wrong?
my brother, i'm a man of peace.

## why do you box?
here we go.

## am i right?
a mighty god.

## was that as easy a fight as it looked?
of course it was easy.

## are you mad at something?
i'm a little upset with myself, because i had a image of this guy falling on a right hand.

## with a left or a right?
oh, definitely.

## did this guy hurt you at all?
not at all.

## bored?
that's right.

## who do you plan to fight next?
uh, well, that's the reverend's job.

## boy, that boy's good, ain't he?
we're just asking the reverend to give us a shot at the title.

## where the fuck you from?
i'll tell you what, honk.

## is this what you want?
that's exactly what i want.

## how was the house, peter?
capacity.

## bad news.

## sol?

## six rolls royces?
wait.

## let me fix your hat.
what up, kid?

## can you forgive me as i forgive you?
i hurt.

## and we'll settle with the champ for what?
fifteen cents on the dollar..

## champ, you would let this man... the only father figure you've ever had, destroy himself for you?
you bet your yarmulke.

## peter, do you know what's wrong?
no.

## artemus?
no.

## sol?
no.

## how about you, champ?
there's a reason everyone has lost interest... in the heavyweight championship of the world.

## a white heavyweight?
man, the two words don't even go together..

## what's the highest grossing fight in the history of boxing?
uh, tyson gibbons.

## can you tell me why, james?
all right, all right.

## that a what?
uh, a a brougham.

## what's a brougham?
it's maroon.

## did we cut?
yeah.

## you guys don't know what a merlot brougham is?
i thought it was a breakfast cereal.

## that what he said.
your daddy said... what?

## you're a little camera shy, aren't you?
yeah.

## this the guy at the top of your list, julio?
look at this shit.

## where'd he go?
good for you.

## what happened?
watch.

## i have an idea.
see?

## oh, you gonna clown me?
you can run this shit yourself.

## i was simply trying to say the champ, he's never lost as a proffessional, right?
yeah.

## yeah, so what?
he was b. f. d.

## who cares?
he was an amateur..

## are you on something?
hey, hey, hey, shut the fuck up.

## ten years ago, who beat roper as an amateur?
his mother.

## uh, who?
terry conklin.

## terry who?
you work for me now.

## now, where were we?
marvin, marvin, chill.

## and the next thing you know... we got guns on you, and what you got, huh?
we don't have any of those.

## but i mean, you know, does violence really solve anything?
i mean, we just came over because you haven't answered our calls or anything like that.

## so you are giving us a shot at the title?
you have my word.

## excuse me, reverend, but your word don't mean shit, all right?
yeah, i mean, your word is rather doo... doo.

## are you still driving that, um, maroon brougham?
yeah.

## artemus?
yeah.

## man, this is this rayon?
this is nice.

## no, he's got something.
shut up!

## you like him, bambi?
i think he's gorgeous.

## say what?
for a white boy.

## may i call you terry?
what you call me is of no concern to me.

## what did you say?
i want you to return to the ring.

## yeah, right, right.
i did cold cock that sucker, didn't i?

## until the next fight of the century, right?
get the fuck outta my chair.

## how much i get?
ten million dollars.

## well.
ten million dollars?

## you found terry conklin, huh?
yep.

## now, what's it gonna take for you to make this happen?
i can't do it.

## money?
no.

## power?
yeah, power.

## and who do you think's gonna see the debacle?
this'll is the biggest payday in sports history, much less boxing.

## or buster douglas against tyson?
julo escobar's a whore on your payroll.

## what did you say?
keep it legal.

## did you hear that?
that's a libelous statement and a racist comment...

## do you hate jews and negroes as well?
i am a jew.

## ring magazine says the fight is a fraud?
the truth needs to be shaped and molded and framed, sol.

## tough day for you, huh?
we need to get these contracts to conklin for his signature before he gets a good lawyer.

## how are the contracts?
nobody understands anything.

## what is this?
i don't know.

## where'd it come from?
mitchell kane.

## what's he want?
he says he wants a private meeting.

## what is it?
pictures of nothing, sol.

## you know what?
i don't need this shit.

## what?
oh.

## that was pretty funny, huh?
never more lucid.

## or is it a pride in your tribe?
uh, i'm taking the road less traveled by.

## what is the truth, after all?
history, they say, is written by the winners.

## what'd she say?
give me a hand here, boys.

## what the hell?
let me see the ring.

## hey, rollo.
i was mad quick, right?

## huh?
let me see the diamond.

## that look all right?

## you know why?
don't worry, man.

## what's up with that?
he ain't here because he's ducking me.

## ain't that right, rev?

## tell him about the deal, will you?
hey, mr. french, i will bust a cap in your ass.

## you?
you stunted little dwarf.

## what you wanna do?
i'm not gonna scare off.

## tranquilize yourself, will you?
look at you.

## you don't want no part of this, do you, white boy?
what you got here, rev, is shit.

## may i?
we have here 100, 000... cards and letters, all for terry conklin.

## let's pick one at random, shall we?
let's get one of these.

## the sultan... is ripe for a fall.
what's the matter?

## do you understand?
las vegas is one of the most exploitive places i've ever seen in my life... particularly exploitive towards women.

## what's that?
that was me on the cover of playboy magazine, but let me say two things.

## did you see him out there?
no.

## the champ has an entourage.
so what about all these reports of all this roomservice?

## so he's not eating any of this stuff?
look.

## is racism driving this fight?
i don't think so.

## are we exploiting a history of divisive racial struggle in this country?
i don't think so.

## would that be all right?
yeah.

## you just wanna blow this fight, don't ya?
look, titus, chill.

## wins?
oh, man, yeah.

## happy?
i'd sooner be turked by a syphillitic bear.

## hmm.
so, what, after after this fight, you'd consider signing him with another promoter?

## what's up, johnny?
yeah, maybe so.

## what about mr. sultan?
uh, mr. sultan, you know, not so good for you guys.

## are you a racist person?
no, i'm not.

## johnny?
too much of it.

## can i have a hug?
we love you, roper.

## is it hope, or is it hype?
we'll find out the answer tomorrow night.

## is that a unitard?
mitchell.

## hey, baby, you feeling all right?
oh, baby, listen.

## we all know you're a racist bastard.
you know what else?

## me, a racist?
you're a pig.

## what have we got here, then, paddy, eh?
white gloves.

## you think this is all just a big joke, right?
oh, yeah.

## you know?
the guy thinks this is a rock concert.

## yeah! it's obvious that the champion is delaying his entrance into the arena.
yet, can a hundred million fans across america be wrong?

## recognize, baby, will you?
we up in here, and he needs to be in the ring.

## he could get tired.
you gonna talk to me like you know me now?

## stu, do you think there could be anything wrong?
i'll tell you what it is, johnny.

## but, just in case, don't get him mad, eh?
he's scared of me.

## huh?
the new heavyweight champ of the world, terry conklin, has signed with me.

## is there any questions?
yes, sir.

## well, i was just wondering up there to mr. roper... what do you think it's gonna feel like to lose to an amateur, chump?
no, just a whole lot of man.

## that's a good idea.
that's it?

## where's my midget?
he's on queer street.

## you ali baba jackson up in this motherfucker?
oh, not this nigga.

i'm worried.

## what did i do?
i loveyou so much.

i had the best fucking night of my entire fucking life...

## what is this?
i don't know.

## is that enough reason to erase someone?
i've been thinking lately how i was before and how i am now, and it's like he changed me.

## what are you doing?
the bloom is certainly fucking offthe rose at this point.

## i mean, she's smart, i think, but not educated.
are you screwing with me?

## i couldn't reallytalk to her about books, you know?
she's more of a magazine reading girl.

## let me turn this off, okay?
hey, it's it's onlyfair.

## where's the real clementine?
i mean, the whole thing with the hair it's all bullshit.

## is it some kind ofa revolt?

## do you have anywhiskey?
no, i don't think hersex is... motivated.

## what?
i don't know.

## what doyou want, joel?
i don't know.

## really?
i'm not a concept, joel.

## shall we go through the castle now?
no, i've changed my mind.

## what's the matter here?
prison ship has arrived full of jews for the camps, madam.

## what camps?
detention camps out at karaolos.

## mrs. fremont?
the general's expecting you in the garden.

## how do you do, mrs. fremont?
i'm very glad to see you.

## didn't you once publish something about the roman ruins in cheltenham?
a very obscure something.

## how did you know?
tom mentioned it in one of his letters.

## will you have tea, or something livelier?
something livelier, please.

## surprised?
tom got me into the habit.

## may we drink to tom?
of course.

## is anything?
in my opinion, yes.

## do you recognize this photograph, general?
of course.

## do you remember how tom got that shot?
we were together.

## didn't tom tell you we had a child on the way?
men like tom are often quite reticent about things that are nearest to their hearts.

## what are your plans for the future?
i haven't quite decided yet.

## how do you do?
have a drink.

## how did your disembarkation go?
smoothly.

## why don't you lend a hand at karaolos?
no, general.

## about the jews?
i feel strange among them.

## in what way?
now that you mention it, i can't think.

## will you have another drink?
thank you, no.

## quirk?
about the jews.

## what story?
that if you gave a good shake to his family tree, you'd find a jew up there.

## do you need any help?
no, thanks.

## how are you?
fine.

## how do you do, mrs. fremont?
american.

## how do you do?
ben ami is one of the palestinians who run this camp.

## would you show him your passport?
of course.

## would you care to come with me?
surely.

## who are you?
he's the palestinian commander, that's who.

## do you let them take care of you or not?
not them.

## how did you change his mind?
just patience and kindness.

## lf the camp has no such drug?
leave him alone.

## you think so?
i know it.

## then your mother was jewish?
yes, and my father.

## david, how are you?
shalom, ari.

## cigar?
no, thanks.

## well, david, how many people have you got by now...... in that barbed wire jungle of yours?
over 30, 000.

## how many arrived yesterday on the star of david?
six hundred and eleven.

## six hundred and eleven?
he thinks he's moses.

## why not tomorrow?
ari, we cannot do it.

## well, can you deliver or not?
i'll do my best.

## do you think i'd risk 10 years in prison for money?
i tell you, it has cost me over 5, 000 since i work with the haganah.

## why not 1, 400?
the british have requisitioned every car, truck and lorry on this island.

## now the boat project is under way, right?
almost accomplished.

## don't the british monitor telegrams?
naturally.

## but the problem, my dear friend, is, why have a master at all?
shouldn't have hurt him, ari.

## now tell me, how is jordana?
i think she's in love.

## she mention me in there?
thank you.

## how did you know i postponed my departure?
central lntelligence has a great talent for spying on the innocent.

## can you tell me about it?
there's a child at the camp i'd like to take out for a holiday.

## then i take it some of the strangeness has worn off?
i know it was foolish to say that.

## what?
i wanted you to get interested...... in something beside your own troubles, and you did.

## do you have a solution?
there's a child out at karaolos...... mrs. fremont would like released for a day.

## what's her name?
karen hansen.

## see to it for me, will you?
very well, sir.

## lsn't it a little irregular?
extremely.

## isn't she a beauty?
hank schlosberg from cincinnati.

## can this abortion make it to palestine?
on my mother's honor, she has made 300 trips...... from cyprus to turkey under her last owner.

## for a two day trip?
five days.

## have you got my jeep yet?
i told you, it's impossible.

## need someone to overhaul the engine tank?
no, my gang can take care of that.

## what about that jeep there?
that belongs to his beatitude...... the greek orthodox archbishop of cyprus.

## may i have another swim before my steak?
just once more, because we're due back at the camp.

## ls that the girl?
yes.

## would it be too difficult to arrange for me to take her back to america?
not from our end.

## would you like to go to america?
of course.

## you mean, go right away?
perhaps.

## what's the matter?
nothing.

## you do want to go, don't you?
yes, but i mean....

## what is there to think about?
i don't know.

## yes?
don't be mad at me.

## she told you?
she is worried about her father.

## but of course, who knows?
it's curious that she didn't mention her father to me.

## what can i do for you, sir?
afraid i'll to have to draw rather heavily on you.

## what's this for?
transport from karaolos, sir.

## who is requesting this?
capt. bowen.

## what authority?
sir cecil bradshaw, of the colonial office.

## what's the query?
i thought you might want...... to draw extra transport from headquarters.

## can i order tea for you?
rather prefer a gin and tonic, if you don't mind.

## how do you do?
we are relocating all the internees from the star of david.

## where are you taking these people?
their destination is not included in your orders, mr....

## piece of paper?
this seems perfectly clear to me.

## there, does that satisfy you?
of course, i don't approve, but...... i guess it makes the record perfect.

## did you hear?
yes, sir.

## what's going on?
military police.

## go and find the commanding officer, will you?
i'd better look into this myself.

## what's this?
the whole area's tied up.

## who's in charge?
o'hara.

## well, bowen, i see you're going to be getting rid of some jews for us?
yes, sir.

## why do you question these orders?
i didn't question.

## would you mind looking into my eye?
it feels like a cinder.

## maj. caldwell, are they taking everybody who was on the star of david?
yes, ma'am, we are.

## karen?
karen hansen.

## how old is she?
fourteen.

## david ben ami?
yes.

## not really?
good luck, sir.

## who was in charge of this evacuation?
chap named bowen, sir.

## look like?
a well set up sort of chap.

## from what command?
23rd gt company, sir.

## ls anything irregular?
could be.

## who issued capt. bowen's orders?
they originated with bradshaw of the colonial office.

## you examined the signatures?
well, naturally, and i countersigned.

## well, those signatures must've been forged?
we can't exclude the possibility.

## your signature was genuine, wasn't it?
someone had to take responsibility, sir.

## what do you propose to do with it?
that boat....

## have you heard me, major?
message received.

## where would they find 200 pounds of dynamite?
get me gen. sutherland.

## do you think they mean it?
nearly two years ago, a haganah ship which we were detaining in the port of haifa...... did blow herself up.

## will they let me?
i'll try and arrange it.

## do you agree?
i'll be glad to.

## reuben?
send this every 10 minutes, and keep on sending it.

## could we interrupt, please?
yes.

## hank?
yes.

## we have enough scrap lumber to build privies on deck?
i guess so.

## anything else?
not for the present, thank you.

## you wanted to see me?
north africa, syria, lebanon and palestine.

## is that what sutherland sent you to find out?
you lied to me about the girl.

## tel aviv yet?
no.

## what else?
i'm taking her off this death trap.

## how do you know the girl wants to get off?
i am trying to save a jewish child.

## don't you have any respect for human life?
don't expect me to get hysterical over one jewish child...... and don't you get hysterical, either.

## ben canaan?
yes.

## not even now?
kitty...... i couldn't.

## go back?
nonsense.

## did we escape for just ourselves alone?
no.

## them or us?
quiet, please.

## is that anything new?
i stay right here.

## why can't you let them go?
you must understand that we british have shown, throughout our history...... an extraordinary talent for troublesome commitments.

## how can you promise something and then not deliver it?
england was fighting for her life in 1917.

## how is it ever going to end?
i don't know.

## yes?
the devil.

## can i drop you at your hotel?
of course.

## mr. smolikov, will you please do me a favor?
refresh yourself with my bath, and then, little bit later, i'll take yours.

## can't you see the position?
no exceptions.

## have you time for me, ari?
always, dr. odenheim.

## what can i do?
we made a mistake...... a bad mistake in letting the children be a part of this.

## what should we do about it?
when a mistake is made, you admit it...... you analyze it, and you correct it.

## who the devil are you?
jorgenson, of the up.

## what is this?
lnformation, sir.

## lnformation for whom?
for the tourists, of course.

## and i suppose these are tourists?
no, sir.

## what were you two talking about?
these are nice fat ones, for this the archbishop will bless you.

## why not?
ought to make news somewhere.

## out to the ship once more?
yes.

## do you really think so?
undoubtedly.

## do you have the power to call off this strike?
i have.

## why?
then call it off.

## you'd still set it off, knowing you've lost?
of course.

## without any regard for the lives you'd be destroying?
with every regard in the world for them.

## but for what purpose?
call it publicity.

## publicity?
yes, publicity.

## does the vulgarity of it shock you?
you can't fight the whole british empire with 600 people.

## when were you there?
a year ago.

## 500, 000 jews against 50 million arabs?
you can't win.

## we have been asked to talk to you, mr. ben canaan.
why don't you appeal to gen. sutherland?

## do you have time?
of course.

## when are you going to stop this thing and let them go?
unfortunately, i can't answer that.

## why don't you make a public statement about it?
i can't do that, kitty.

## now i find myself asking how can any man let it happen?
jew, gentile, buddhist, mohammedan...... no matter what he is.

## is that all?
i heard of dr. odenheim's death.

## without food?
i think i can go without food as long as you.

## do you think the british will give in?
we'll give in first.

## if you hate these people so much, why do you want to go to palestine with them?
because there, jews fight instead of talk.

## that proves something?
there are lots of exceptions.

## and do you know something?
by afternoon, everybody was wearing stars of david.

## why'd they do that?
if you don't just know why they did it, dov...... well, maybe that's what's wrong with you.

## do you hear me?
this is the exodus.

## we pause for politics?
gen. sutherland, at his own request, has been relieved of his duties on cyprus.

## have you seen mr. ben canaan?
i want to thank him for letting me on the ship.

## have you seen dov?
no, not since he left the ship.

## hello?
shalom.

## again?
a boy about 17 just went into asa's house.

## what's your name?
karen.

## what's yours?
edna.

## and then, after the ghetto was destroyed?
i hid in the sewers for five months.

## eating what?
when i couldn't sneak out at night and steal garbage, i killed rats.

## and they sent you to auschwitz?
yes.

## to what work were you assigned in auschwitz?
i told you that twice already.

## cleaning up what?
the camp area.

## and when auschwitz was liberated, you walked to germany?
you asked me that already, too.

## so you want to blow up british installations for the lrgun?
yes.

## you're an expert dynamiter, true?
just try me.

## will you assist us in making them clear?
sure.

## why shouldn't i tell the truth?
this is always hard to answer.

## describe what?
whatever you like.

## who went through the third gate?
girls.

## all the girls?
no.

## what happened to them?
the ss guards kept some of them.

## now, those who went through the left gate to be killed...... how was the killing accomplished in auschwitz?
they went in to take showers, 2, 000 or 3, 000 at a time.

## you blew up quite a few nazis with this dynamite?
all i could.

## from the gas chambers, the bodies went where?
the ovens.

## before the installation of the ovens, what happened to the bodies?
they buried them.

## how?
in trenches and holes.

## and who dug the holes?
i don't know.

## i ask you again, who dug the graves?
i don't know.

## now may i tell you something, dov landau?
at no time did the jews use dynamite in the warsaw ghetto.

## do you remember better now?
maybe.

## true?
yes.

## correct?
we take into consideration that you were less than 13 when you entered auschwitz.

## is there anything else?
yes.

## you wanted me?
yes.

## so?
i've got to see akiva.

## we tell haganah where our leaders are hiding?
forget haganah.

## his son's different?
just tell akiva and let him decide.

## if i can find him, where can i telephone you this evening?
i'll be here on the terrace from 7:0 on.

## do you like the view here?
mr. ben canaan.

## are we both eating alone?
i am.

## won't you sit down?
thanks.

## would you like a drink?
i had one at the consulate.

## what were you doing at the consulate today?
i've asked them to help me find karen's father.

## what happens if you find out her father's dead?
then i'll take her back to america with me.

## won't your husband have something to say about that?
my husband was killed a year ago...... in a border skirmish near the sheikh hussein bridge.

## you mean, here in palestine?
he was a news photographer covering the near east.

## don't you feel uncomfortable here?
i guess i'm as safe here as any place else.

## where do you come from?
i don't come from anywhere.

## do you like farms?
i was raised on one.

## do i know you well enough to ask you for a lift?
i think so.

## have you found another man?
nothing serious.

## why not?
many reasons.

## and you want a whole one?
exactly.

## what else?
excuse me, sir.

## now?
i have to go back to the terrace.

## two hundred pounds of dynamite?
immediately, the british draw proper conclusions.

## may i speculate?
of course.

## correct?
it's close.

## also correct?
also.

## an alliance to fight?
of course.

## but what about you, ari?
forget haganah for one moment, and tell me what you think.

## may i tell you something?
firstly...... justice itself is an abstraction...... completely devoid of reality.

## i suppose that means more bombings and more killings?
i'll put it this way.

## now tell me, how is your mother?
she's fine.

## and little jordana?
little jordana just won her second marksmanship medal with the palmach.

## and that young rascal, david ben ami, she's still interested?
she can't wait till he gets back from cyprus.

## and barak...... still counts my name among the dead on yom kippur?
ten years.

## doesn't he understand i must work for lsrael in my way...... just as he works for it in his?
you can't talk to him about it.

## it's not much of a home, is it?
with only rose's samovar to make a memory real.

## you want to look with me?
sure.

## do you know your bible?
ln a presbyterian sort of way.

## isn't your father's name barak?
in russia, he was yakov rabinski.

## don't you understand that you make me feel like a presbyterian...... when you can't, for just a minute or two, forget that you're a jew?
i'm here, barak.

## have you hurt yourself?
no.

## he's got a girl with him.
ari?

## a girl?
an american girl.

## how do you know she's american?
sarah, i travel.

## what is her name, barak?
mrs. fremont.

## why does she go chasing after my ari?
whether she's chasing him, i don't know.

## yes?
what a nice surprise.

## ari?
take this for me.

## now, young ladies and gentlemen...... can you give me a little style?
it's not fair keeping david in cyprus so long.

## a nice piece of strudel, mrs. fremont?
i couldn't.

## that is if you are ready, mrs. fremont?
you should see it before dark.

## and do you know something else?
i've been elected to the rooms committee, bungalow 12.

## already?
yes.

## you remember edna, the girl with freckles?
i think so.

## hebrew?
yes.

## what's the matter?
you act like a stranger.

## what?
i had an accident on the road today.

## how have you been?
fine, thank you.

## yes?
dr. engel, mrs. fremont.

## the young lady understands, does she not?
yes, we told her everything.

## get him ready, sir?
akiva ben canaan.

## you have?
i'll take it down.

## what do you want?
the un may vote on partition by the end of the month.

## so?
if partition is voted, we'll need every man to fight the arabs.

## irgun, haganah, what difference does it make?
i spent 14 months in that prison.

## we waste lrgun blood to free arabs?
if you turn 400 arabs loose, they are going to run in 400 different directions.

## how many lrgun does your plan call for?
twenty six, divided into four attack groups...

## what do you want with dov landau?
akiva's execution is six days away.

## why don't you surrender?
because landau will be sentenced within a few hours...... and sent to acre.

## with what?
anything we can smuggle in.

## ls everything in order?
okay, chief.

## is akiva hit?
we are both hit.

## do you want me to slow down?
no, you must go faster.

## is the pain bad?
mortal wounds give no pain.

## are you hurt badly?
no, i'm all right.

## are you sure?
i'm sure.

## dov?
why, yes.

## will you come to the hospital right away?
it's an emergency.

## what's wrong?
nothing's wrong, but you must lie still.

## how is he?
i opened the wound.

## will he live?
i don't know.

## how is it now?
24 for partition, 9 against, and 8 abstaining.

## what's wrong?
you've won your freedom.

## if it makes no difference, why have you fought so hard?
because we had hundreds of thousands of people with no other place to go.

## why should they go anywhere?
this is their home as well as ours.

## don't you see?
we have to prove to the world that we can get along together.

## i look at you...... and i ask myself, what are you doing here in the middle of somebody else's fight?
you should go back to america.

## what does this have to do with attacking?
gan dafna commands the jezreel valley.

## must we slaughter defenseless children for what we don't need?
we've chosen gan dafna because we want a quick victory.

## why?
don't ask why.

## what happened?
you must evacuate gan dafna by midnight tomorrow.

## do you want me to dishonor myself completely?
goodbye.

## who goes?
dov landau.

## who's in charge?
jordana ben canaan.

## have you got headquarters set up here?
ln the dining hall.

## ari, how are you?
i'm fine.

## how many guns have you got?
eight.

## ls the transmitter working?
yes.

## how many children do we have here under 13?
about 150.

## what if they attack tonight?
that's a risk we'll have to take.

## will you help me?
i want you to stay here.

## have you forgotten every 15 year old girl in gan dafna...... is a nurse, and a good one?
stay here, anyway.

## will you promise?
we will.

## mr. ben ami, how many men did you bring?
only two to a truck, but from the outside it looks like an army.

## watch out.
where is jordana?

## what are you doing out here?
sixty palmachniks just came.

## you understand?
now, keep down.

## ls ari back?
yes.

## have you seen karen?
i sent them all to bed hours ago.

## what's my assignment?
patrol gan dafna while we move out.

## what's the matter?
this is taha...... mukhtar of abu yesha.

## and in the dark?
we of all people...... should no longer be surprised when death reaches out to us.

## what are they trying to tell you?
i don't know, but we are getting her out.

## what the hell do you think you are doing?
there is a life form in here.

## could you hurry please, miss?
done, captain.

## can i have this please?
thank you.

## are you okay?
yeah.

## can you give me one good reason why i shouldn't arrest you?
i am dr. aki ross.

## do you realize you have just risk the lives at my squad and me?
look.

## you and your men?
she thinks you are a man.

## have we been given a choice?
nobody asked you to save me.

## gray?
yeah, nice to see you too.

## let's make sure of this, shall we?
i hate getting scanned.

## why are you always busting my chop?
people, let's just do this thing.

## or that woman?
both.

## what level is he?
blue.

## how much more time?
not enough.

## what the hell is going on?
we lost contact.

## what?
forward me the phantom data and everything we got in the file spirits collected so far.

## spirits?
aki, you know there are elements in the council military just waiting for an excuse to shut us down.

## 1 0 years ago, who discovered the energy and the phantoms?
you.

## and who proved the same energy source existed in humans and every life form?
you.

## what is this?
read.

## do we not?
yes, indeed we do.

## and what exactly does that mean, doctor?
it means there is a very good chance to being from the zeus cannon built in the phantoms in a media.

## you mean the spirit of the earth?
yes.

## has a spirit?
that's a fairy tale, doctor.

## don't you agree?
yes, i mean of disabling the phantoms.

## where is the proof?
here.

## but i wonder what caused?
doctor, i can't keep hiding in the background while you protect me.

## mind if i take a look?
you'll probably get bored.

## so what are you doing?
oh, i see.

## what do you think you are doing?
we just gonna strengthen them for a while.

## it's your idea?
we just help the captain up a little.

## where's your sense of romance?
you see how the captain looks at her.

## what's going on?
probably just a glint.

## leaving your helmet on and not telling me who you were?
that doesn't seem a little childish.

## now you know what's going on, alright?
now i know.

## and you won't even see me?
i was probably helping dr. sid collected the spirit wave.

## about what?
about the spirits you collected.

## the second was a fish.
how could you?

## a fish?
the third was a deer i found in a wildlife preserved outside moscow.

## ever try to track a sparrow out of space?
it's no fun.

## what am i saying?
you probably would love that.

## what?
you skipped one.

## you don't believe any of this, do you?
i just... don't know, aki.

## is this why you shut me out?
you should have told me.

## who does?
i better get back to scanning.

## what were you impressions of dr ross?
she seems very capable and determines.

## ebullient behavior, sir?
the general is wondering why he explains himself to a captain.

## no heroin today, okay?
everything by the book.

## have you done any wasteland recon before?
and get pretty ugly.

## what is it doing out here?
hoping for life to return.

## is that our spirit, doc?
no.

## distance?
hard to say.

## the barrier cities?
i mean it's just by with theory energy.

## captain, do you read me?
once again.

## are you alright?
locate that seat.

## what the hell is happening here?
dr ross is to be taken into the custody now.

## how is she, doctor?
she is dying.

## aki, where are we?
on an alien planet.

## how is that possible?
i'm not entirely sure.

## dream?
well, whatever it is.

## what's happening to me?
dr sid is implanting the 7th spirit directly into your body.

## and i am watching... what, major?
it seems dr ross has been recording her dreams.

## and why would i be interested in it... her dreams?
this is it.

## why are they staring at us?
not at us.

## how is she, doctor?
she is going to be fine.

## aki, can you hear me?
i'd finished it.

## sir?
my wife and daughter.

## did i ever tell you that?
i try to imagine what...

## you've lost family, haven't you?
yes, sir.

## how can you be?
captain, please.

## precisely, i think the giant ones are like our whales along for the ride?
it must be the ship of some kind crazy known as ark.

## but how could they survive the trip across outer space on a hunk of rock?
they didn't.

## what do you think about all this, captain?
i think that explains why we never had a chance.

## how they die?
since then, all they know is suffering.

## how many phantoms?
more than enough to convince the council, sir.

## major, what the hell is going on here?
it must be carry resistible charge passing through the barrier.

## okay, now what?
we're going through the station.

## what?
captain, with all respect...

## doc?
interesting.

## we'll be back for you, sergeant.
anybody hurt?

## you hear me?
i hear you, captain.

## neil, do you read me?
loud and clear, captain.

## can you disengage it from the cockpit?
no, sir.

## jane, do you mind if we stop talking?
i gotta concentrate here.

## what's your status?
almost there.

## where are you going?
you and sid are getting out of here now.

## what am i wrong?
no, i agree.

## then why should we try it?
because we don't need to extract the 8th spirit.

## and how do we do that... exactly?
i can construct the device.

## and then what?
and then we wait.

## we wait and see what happens?
yes.

## aki?
i say we go in.

## what caused the battle failed, general hein?
i'm afraid it's only the matter of time before the phantoms develop into immunity to our barriers.

## target, sir?
the phantom crater.

## there are so many of them?
it's the zeus.

## aki, gray, are you alright?
a little shaking.

## do you have it?
the 8th has been destroyed.

## what are we going to do now?
sid, i need to talk to the station.

## what is that thing?
i don't know, sir.

## ghosts?
yes, spirits that are confused, lost and angry.

## this is not a good place to be.
oh right?

## definitely not a good place to be.
what the hell is that?

## are you alright?
i'm fine.

## sid, do you read me?
go ahead.

## you could destroy our last hope.
you hear me, sir?

## ask them to play nice?
combat strategy is your area of expertise, not mine.

## do you see it?
yes, a compatible spirit.

## which one?
i have it.

## do you hear me, sid?
the wave pattern is completed.

## what the hell is going on?
give me your overpack.

## are you sure you have the final spirit?
yes, yes.

## how can you know that?
don't worry, the phantom told me.

## what are they trying to tell you?
i don't know, but we are getting her out.

## what the hell do you think you are doing?
there is a life form in here.

## hasty?
torrey'll be on gavabutu in three days.

## you're eddington?
yes, sir.

## in charge of piers and warehouses?
that's right, sir.

## what kept you?
i was recruiting native labour for piers and warehouses, sir.

## that doesn't mean you have to look like a native, does it?
i didn't expect to be called to see the admiral, sir.

## didn't you see the directive that all personnel be clean shaven?
i must have missed it, sir.

## did the admiral want to see me about my beard?
eddington, you're being transferred to gavabutu, with the rank of captain.

## are you sure you have the right eddington?
you're being assigned to admiral rockwell torrey as chief of staff.

## my aide, mr armstrong.
admiral torrey?

## colonel, your men in shape for a parachute drop?

## mr gottlieb?
weather.

## when?
a week, maybe.

## aren't there any more r4ds in toulebonne?

the same way captains did.

## you got a pencil?
thank you.

## admiral, have these correspondents been instructed in security?
they'll be instructed, captain.

## lieutenant, do you have any idea how broderick knows these details?
i'm afraid not, sir.

## you wouldn't know about owynn sending special dispatches to toulebonne?
i wouldn't, sir.

## yes?
it's all right, captain.

## where's the admiral?
he's with them.

## shall we give the boys a rundown?
might be better in private, sir.

## admiral torrey, is the operation going according to schedule?
not exactly.

## right, admiral?
right, sir.

## the island's ours?
yes.

## why did they pull out?
i think that about covers it for now.

## admiral, would you check these dispatches and advise me on how we should mop this up?
yes, certainly.

## the admiral's leaving?
he feels everything is shipshape.

## aren't you going with broderick?
no.

one word from me to broderick and you're on your way.

## the airstrip?
planes are landing on it.

## why not have a submarine take me there?

## what?
i don't know.

## i can take care of myself.

## who's the chaperone on this junket?

his name isn't cunliffe.

## what are you getting at?
put them down and turn your back.

## see?
i might as well be in a mother hubbard.

## bucking for a purple heart?
just a friendly wound.

## about 5, 000 landed while i was there.
shall we adjourn to the ward room?

## 5, 000?
at that rate, we only have three weeks.

## could halsey's carriers do a reconnaissance job for us?
not soon.

## can't you get long range recon planes?
captain, we're on poverty row.

## who had given it to her?
my father.

## just somewhere i can find a cab?
let's go, hurry up...

## do you want a towel for your hands?
i would take you to the village, but i'm really busy.

## what's worse than dead?
believe me, there's worse.

## so, uh, what's your excuse this time?
i went to see my friend keith's band, and they didn't go on until 10:00.

## who the hell is keith?
he's this guy that i really, really like, and it was really important for me to be there so i could get on his radar.

## okay?
i don't want you on any of his equipment.

## what the hell are you doing up?
it's after midnight.

## what?
he just got back from school.

## okay?
if you stay up all night, you can't get up in the morning, and you can't afford to be late for school anymore.

## what?
i'm sleeping.

## ah, she just doesn't care, you know?
it's like talking to a brick wall that every guy in town wants to feel up.

## can this please wait until morning?
fine.

## and you know what?
i'm tired of it.

## you know why?
but we're so concerned with the kids liking us, now they see me as their best friend instead of the authority figure that i am.

## um, dave?
i'm pretty sure if you asked them, they wouldn't consider you their best friend.

## you think i like that they talk back?
no.

## am i glad they feel comfortable enough to tell us how they really feel?
no.

## nah, nah, you know what the problem is?
they have no fear.

## okay?
they're not afraid of us.

## you know what?
hey, dad, i need you to sign this math test.

## you failed?
no my teacher just wants your autograph.

## how could you fail after all that money we spent on a tutor?
it's first period and i guess i might've missed some classes.

## you see what i'm talking about?
i i hope you didn't go to school dressed like that.

## a what?
no, it's just a henna.

## no big deal?
that's keith's band.

## okay, you know what?
you're not seeing that guy again until i meet him.

## are you going to sign this test, or should i just forge it?
apparently, you kids have forgotten that we are the parents.

## okay?
if anybody misses their curfew, or doesn't do their homework, or talks back, or just looks at us wrong, they are getting a spanking.

## do you?
just try me and see what happens.

## now who wants to mess with me first?
yeah.

## okay?
you're nothing but ponies.

## pretty good, huh?
it just came out of me.

## you'd actually spank them?
no.

## what?
we put a dollar in a jar.

## see?
this is just what we need.

## how's that project going, larry?
it's good.

## are you actually studying on a saturday?
yeah, just trying to catch up on some of this math.

## guess what, dad?
keith finally asked me out, but i told him that you had to meet him first.

## who the hell broke my putter and tried to superglue it back together?
it wasn't me.

## huh?
okay.

## do you have any idea how much this cost me?
i am so pissed right now, i i don't even know what to do.

## that is the new policy, right?
i mean, larry used something of yours without asking.

## hey, hillary, maybe he's just afraid that larry is such a fierce warrior, he's going to vanquish him.
you're not going to hit him?

## why are they doing this to me?
i i don't want to spank them.

## it'll look painful, but it won't really hurt, you know?
like in pro wrestling.

## what happened?
nothing happened.

## what, do you think you leave the house and everything falls apart?
nothing happened.

## you beat the crap out of larry?
no.

## hey, did you get those tofutti cuties i like?
i cannot believe you hit our kids.

## what is wrong with you?
they called my bluff.

## what was i supposed to do?
oh, yeah, dave, that makes sense.

## sweetie, where are you going?
dad beat me up, so i'm moving to kenny's.

## he did what?
he hit me.

## you can stay as long as you want, right, mom?
of course.

## 15 minutes of tv?
it's not so bad.

## yeah?
i'm eartha marshall.

## when you hit larry, was it open fist, closed fist, with a belt?
it was with remorse.

## so you witnessed the incident?
no, no, i wasn't around.

## is larry here?
maybe he is, maybe he isn't.

## what do you want?
i'm here for larry.

## larry, come on, okay?
let's go home.

## oh, you're being ridiculous, okay?
i want you to come home, right now.

## you'll cut off his feet and put them up on sticks, huh?
barbarian.

## dad?
okay, so you wanted to meet keith, here he is.

## you're keith?
uh, yeah.

## crack whore keith?
uh, you know, actually we changed our name.

## isn't he great?
yeah, yeah.

## princeton, huh?
you can't ; it'll ruin everything.

## i mean, how horrible must we have been lately to make him hit us?
larry getting his ass beat is the best thing that's ever happened to us.

## yeah, you will.
are you forgetting what dad did to you?

## i mean, who decided all of a sudden that giving your kid a little swat on the behind was child abuse?
it's crazy.

## your father spanked you when you were a kid, right?
many times.

## but you did threaten to spank them, right?
no, dave.

## you're a good kid, and it won't happen anymore, okay?
so i want you to come home now.

## come on, larry, i apologized, all right?
i want to go home, and i want to go home right now.

## why should i care?
because i'm your father, and i said so.

## larry, look, i'm going to count to three, okay?
and if you don't go inside and get your stuff...

## just do it, okay?
one... two...

## i'm bleeding?
well, i apologized to larry.

## what do you do to make him forgive you?
yeah, that's not going to work for you, larry.

## can't you at least talk to him for me?
well, this is something you're going to have to do yourself.

## great, not only do i have to talk to him, i have to be a man, too?
honey, you can't stay here forever.

## dad?
yeah.

## don't worry about it, okay?
we're good.

## really?
yeah.

## dad?
hey, hey, keith.

## hey, who do we have here?

as you wish.

## wheres your concentration?
maybe you regret taking the red pill.

## as well as a cook?
yes.

manuela isn't a whore anymore.

## how long have you known her?
since this morning.

i'm going to leave the center for a few months.

## what about el salvador?
i don't feel well.

## why do you want to move in here if you're ill?
i'm pregnant.

## what are you going to do?
have it, of course.

## what do you expect?
i thought it'd be less of a scandal here.

## god knows where he is.
can't the father help you out?

## but you know who he is, don't you?
of course.

## who do you take me for?
three months, i think.

## aren't they here yet?
i don't where they are.

## wasn't she with you?
i just left her at home, in bed.

## what's wrong?
i think it's food poisoning.

## why didn't you tell me when i called?
we didn't want to upset you.

## has a doctor seen her?
yes.

## so we cancel the show?
i'd like to speak to huma, please.

## what do we do now?
if it won't give you a heart attack, i could do her part.

## but can you act?
i can lie very well, and i'm used to improvising.

## huma, what'll we do?
we can't wait any longer.

## why did you bother?
i hope you like it.

## why did you do that to her?
i was a brute when we met.

## are you doing everything the doctor told you?
i just saw him.

## and?
i went for my results.

## what world do you think you're living in?
i don't know.

hello.

## how are you?

## are you learning the part too?
of course not.

## if you know, why ask?
if you don't want me to tell huma, do it in the bathroom.

## you think it's worth it?
i'd get no work.

## for what?
for killing.

## that's fair, father.

## what do you want?
apparently our friend over there... was happy with what you did.

## i was in my room eating.

## i think i can still rely on you.

i was getting the bananas.

## and the bedroom won't, you know?
he hasn't been to bed for 48 hours.

you know how stupid i am about moves.

## shouldn't i leave them?
no.

## why does he carry the bag and groceries into the study?
they have to be out of the way.

## am i on?

## why does that other idiot go out with sardines?
i'm not getting at you.

## who knows?
the wellsprings of human action are deep and cloudy.

what voices?

## must you put your tie on to look?
mrs clockett.

## why not?
mrs crackett.

## you still poking around?
yes, still poking.

## clackett.

## that's not mr hackham's, is it?
nothing but flapping doors in this house.

## shall i let them go all over?
anything, but don't tell anyone we're here.

## did i have a dress like this?
i shouldn't buy anything this tarty.

## now the study door's open again.
did you give me it?

## you put me in there with the black sheets.
what's going on?

## we have a problem.
why did you lock the door?

## which one this time?
left.

## where did you last see it?
it was in her eye.

## she opens her eyes very... don't you?
i feel i should rush forward.

## brooke, is this going to happen during a performance?
she'll keep going.

## what's the matter?
nose bleed.

## where?
in my eye.

## your left eye?
yes.

## ok?
i think so.

## all right, freddy?
i just have a thing about...

## ok, i'll take it off.
where's selsdon?

## darling, this isn't the sort of glue that never comes unstuck, is it?
oh, mrs clackett's made us sardines.

## now what?
a hot water bottle.

## what did you say?
nothing.

## what did i do with the sardines?
you hear funny things about old houses.

## roger, there's something in there.
what?

## where are you?
i know this is going to sound silly, but...

## why don't you put the sardines down?
i'm stuck to the sardines.

## stop?
thank you.

## come on again?
right, only sooner.

## what's the line?
i've heard of getting stuck with a problem.

## would it perhaps be better if i came on earlier?
only there's a hiatus between freddy's exit and my entrance.

## yeah?
i've got it.

## what?
come on a little earlier.

## am i putting him on or vice versa?
freddy, from your exit.

## what am i doing now?
breaking into paper bags.

## what have they got to offer?
one microwave oven.

## now, where's his desk?
they all say the same thing:it's hard to adjust to retirement.

## has anything ever dematerialised or flown about?
yes.

## but where is she?
i can see i'm going to be opening sardines all night.

## or, if he did, i didn't hear it.
where's she gone?

## darling, where are you?
that stuff doesn't eat through glue, just trousers.

## you don't think it eats through...?
someone has broken into my house...... into someone's house, and a young woman is missing.

## we've found them.
are you ok?

## in my underwear?
let's say no more.

## you know him?
he's dealt with by our office.

## where is it?
stay there till you're dressed.

## i've taken your dress off you.
remember the biscuit tin you gave me on our first anniversary?

## who are you?
doing the taps.

## income tax?
that's right.

## are you dressed yet?
i've got the dress stuck to my head now.

## on women?
i'll do the taps on the bath first.

## i'm off.
where is vicki?

## tax on women?
they'll tax anything these days.

## wc?
since you're upstairs...

## who are you?
i don't know who she is.

## mrs clackett, who are these people?
just arab sheikhs.

## what about you?
i'm taking our files on tax evasion to basingstoke.

## is it?
oh, you're acting.

## do something?
no, we'll struggle through.

## some other problem, freddy?
since we're stopped...

## why did i ask?
i'm stupid about plot.

## could i ask another dumb question?
all of my studies in world drama lie at your disposal.

## why is the sheikh philip's double?
he comes in and we think he's, you know...

## but it is a coincidence, isn't it?
it is kind of a coincidence, freddy, yes.

## you see?
interesting.

## will the audience get it?
you show them.

## tell her.
what's going to be left of this show when i'm back in new york and you're up there on your own?

## why brooke?
it was sweet.

## where do you think they've been all weekend?
that's why he didn't realise the set was wrong.

## you mean...?
most exciting.

## is she all right?
she will be.

## this one's a bit, you know?
i'm feeling a bit, you know, myself.

## last line?
right.

## what's that, dad?
when all around is uncertainty, there's nothing like a good old fashioned plate of sardines.

## what's this?
there's only one thing missing:a plate of sardines.

## how could i be in decatur and paducah when i was doing hamlet in new york?
i caught up with the show in miami beach.

## sir, your ticket?
i'm the director.

## do you think we'll get act one places?
she'll pull herself together now we've called places.

## will she?
you know dotty.

## what will it be like by cleveland?
if only she'd speak.

## there may not be a show.
has she gone?

## she's walked out already?
she's locked in and won't speak.

## you've called places?
yes.

## brooke?
not brooke, dotty.

## done the front of house calls?
front of house calls.

## no luck?
i haven't even started the front of house calls.

## no?
you know dotty.

## no?
no.

## for us?
no...

## last night?
she took me to a pub she knows.

## you?

## selsdon?
this show is beyond my help.

## is she all right?
yes, darling.

## are you sure?
maybe teddy.

## and you're here?
yes.

## how?
she took it amiss.

## what did he say?
she's fine.

## all right, everyone?
teddy or freddy.

## quiet on stage, stand by, curtain up, act one.
what's the house like?

## now what?
we're going up.

## any other thoughts to communicate?
not right now.

## oh, didn't you?
i shouldn't buy anything as tarty...

## knocking?
knocking.

## i mean, hidden under all the sheets and towels in here?
i can't, you know, just stand here indefinitely.

## darling, why did you lock the door?
i didn't.

## why did you lock the door?
i didn't.

## like what?
in your underwear.

## a hot water bottle?
i didn't put it there.

## ooh, yes...
someone in the bathroom?

## a prompt?
get the van loaded.

## i'm going to come and sort you...
what?

## you've got sardines?
if there's nothing i can offer you...

## police?
i thought he was coming at four.

## i know you'll be seeing her.
so, where's my...?

## who's that?
this one's a thracian.

## how?

hamstrung?

## what's your name, slave?
take his sword.

## how long have you been here?
six months.

## what's your name?
you don't want to know my name.

## indeed, what will i think of you?
direct your courage to the girl, spartacus.

## what's your name?
varinia.

## move along there.
spartacus, why are you looking at that girl?

## did they hurt you?
one of them is marcus licinius crassus.

## what?
wait a minute.

## crassus here?
have the goodness to sit.

## is anything wrong, your nobility?
no.

## surely you don't think we came all the way to capua for gymnastics?
but i beg your honours.

## are you serious, sir?
arrange it immediately.

## you do have a certain variety, don't you?
yes.

## how do you know?
i heard marcellus tell one of his guards.

## who fiights?
i don't know.

## what if they matched you and me?
they won't.

## would you fiight?
i'd have to.

## would you try to kill me?
yes, i'd kill.

## would your excellencies care to make your selection now?
claudia.

## for you, lady helena... may i suggest praxus?
a veritable tiger.

## david?
crixus, yes.

## practically every man in this school is an expert with a thracian sword... but the trident is something very rare these days.
have you ever seen such a pair of shoulders?

## may i suggest... the ethiopian?
there are very few ethiopians in the country.

## draba?
oh, no.

## you heard the instruction, marcellus?
no.

## may i conduct your magnifiicences to the gallery now?
crassus, don't talk about gracchus.

## how else can one become master of the mob... and fiirst senator of rome?
crassus, it's so boring.

## what country are you from?
britannia.

## how long have you been a slave?
since i was thirteen.

## buy her, your magnifiicence?
you're horribly rich.

## what is it?
as from this moment, your husband is commander of the garrison of rome.

## what about your litter bearers?
after all, every one of them is under 20... and taller than they should be.

## she sets rather a high standard for you, does she?
your pleasure, your highness.

## how were you able to get my appointment without gracchus knowing?
i fought fiire with oil.

## why doesn't he kill him?
kill him.

## she's been sold.
what's the matter now?

## she's been sold?
no talking in the kitchen, slave.

## where's the mighty crassus?
out of the city.

## there are more slaves in rome than romans.
why call back the legions... when the garrison of rome has nothing to do... but to defend us from sausage makers?

## with the garrison absent, what's to prevent them from rising too?
i did not say the whole garrison.

## will you accept such a charge, glabrus?
he awaits you in the atrium, sir.

## what have we here?
a gift from the governor of sicily, sir.

## for whom did you practice this wondrous talent?
for the children of my master... whom i also taught the classics.

## what position have we, i wonder, for a boy of such varied gifts?
you shall be my body servant.

## are you on guard duty?
my dear crassus, congratulate me.

## did gracchus have something to do with this brilliant affair?
yes, he even proposed it.

## the rest of the garrison remains.
and you?

## under whose command?
under caesar's.

## do you truly believe i'd order my legions to enter rome?
i only point out that you can if you have to.

## are you not aware of rome's most ancient law... that no general may enter the city at the head of his armed legions?
sulla did.

## what's happening to us?
we look for wine when we should be hunting bread.

## once we're on the march... we'll free every slave in every town and village.
what else can we be?

## the sea.
can anybody get a bigger army than that?

## what good is the sea if you have no ships?
the cilician pirates have ships.

## he couldn't catch up with me.
how'd you escape?

## do you realize... nobody can ever sell you again?
nobody can sell you.

## i've been good to you?
yes.

## yes, hasn't she?
i like it.

## have you noticed the nastiest of tyrants are invariably thin?
in spite of your vices, you are the most generous roman of our time.

## vices?
perhaps i used the wrong word.

## how may i help you?
great gracchus, i fiind it diffiicult to hate... but there's one man i can't think of without fuming.

## who's that?
crassus.

## do you blame me?
i sold crassus this woman, varinia.

## whom?
varinia.

## why not?
to annoy crassus, of course, and to help you.

## do you steal, antoninus?
no, master.

## do you lie?
not if i can avoid it.

## have you ever dishonoured the gods?
no, master.

## do you refrain from these vices out of respect for the moral virtues?
yes, master.

## do you eat oysters?
when i have them, master.

## do you eat snails?
no, master.

## do you consider the eating of oysters to be moral... and the eating of snails to be immoral?
no, master.

## it is all a matter of taste, isn't it?
yes, master.

## and taste is not the same as appetite... and therefore not a question of morals, is it?
it could be argued so, master.

## how are they coming?
good.

## where would you be now, you lout... if some woman hadn't fought all the pains of hell... to get you into this accursed world?
i can handle a knife in the dark as well as anyone.

## where do you people come from?
most of us come from the estate of lillius.

## what kind of work did you do there?
sixteen years a carpenter and mason.

## what kind of work did you do?
i was a chief steward.

## what kind of work did you do?
singer of songs.

## but what work did you do?
that's my work.

## what else do you do?
i can do feats of magic.

## magic?
maybe he can make the romans disappear.

## how about you?
here we have a likely subject.

## how many fiingers do you see?
three.

## thank you.
how many fiingers do you see?

## would you like to try?
hit it against the rock, gently.

## you haven't?
here.

## where'd you learn that song?
i'm free.

## and what do i know?
i don't even know how to read.

## know what?
everything.

## what garrisons will we fiind there?
there are two legions in the garrison.

## where is this slave general?
dionysius, get the litter bearers out of the rain.

## who are lsis and serapis?
gods of the east.

## why should they want us to win?
because they favour cilicia... and cilicia, like you, fiights against the romans.

## would you like some wine?
i drink only after the bargain has been concluded... never before.

## how many ships do these cilicians have?
five hundred at least.

## what is the price?
price is 100, 000 sesterces per ship.

## you have such a sum?
we will have.

## when will the ships be ready?
beautiful.

## two years?
if we're not in brundusium seven months from now... we'll never be there.

## what if we assemble the ships... and there is no longer a slave army to board them?
we'll give you a chest of treasure now, the rest when we get to brundusium.

## this one?
yes.

## will you join me?
i will.

## you know him?
i entertained him one afternoon.

## you?
in the arena.

## may i ask you something?
you can ask.

## surely you know you're going to lose, don't you?
you have no chance.

## what are you going to do?
we'll decide that when they get here.

## knowing that you must lose?
knowing we can.

## how many are there?
about six cohorts.

## where?
at the mouth of the valley... against the cliffs.

## strong camp?
they have no stockade.

## are you sure?
i'm very sure.

## that's better.
did they see you?

## what's your name?
marcus glabrus.

## you afraid to die?
it's easy to die.

## haven't you seen enough gladiators in the arena... to see how easy it is to die?
of course you have.

## what are you going to do to me?
i don't know.

## what should we do with him?
let's have a matched pair, him and me.

## if opposed, he threatens to ravage the countryside... and destroy every legion sent against him.
do you recognize this baton?

## and once they get to the sea?
they plan to take ship with cilician pirates and return to their homes.

## from which port do they propose to embark?
i don't know.

## is that name familiar to you?
yes, it does seem to be.

## after he talked to you, what happened then?
i was tied to a horse and lashed out of camp.

## how many of your company escaped?
fourteen have reported thus far.

## did you surround your camp with moat and stockade?
no.

## how long have you been there?
a little while.

## why didn't you say something?
you seemed so happy.

## i don't care.
is it blue shadows and purple woods?

## you've got, you've yes?
you have to be gentle with me.

## why, darling?
i'm going to have a baby.

## what?
a baby.

## when?
in the spring.

## i mean, how do you know?
i know.

## why didn't you tell me?
i just did.

## did i hurt you?
no, you didn't.

## why don't you kiss me?
this is the fiirst time i was ever going to have a baby.

## are there reports on metapontum?
heralds are crying the news now.

## have you estates in metapontum?
no.

## how can this spartacus train an army in seven months?
there's something wrong, something very wrong.

## where is spartacus now?
he's nearing the seaport of brundusium.

## will you excuse us?
i hear you've taken a house in the fourth ward.

## why have you left us for gracchus and the mob?
i've left no one, least of all rome.

## is it me you want or is it the garrison?
both.

## if you were i, would you take the fiield against spartacus?
of course.

## why?
you know gracchus is my friend.

## which is worse:to betray a friend or to betray rome herself?
my dear crassus, i face no such choice.

## how's your health?
excellent, as you know.

## but have you thought how costly my services might be?
we buy everything else these days.

## what's your fee?
my election as fiirst consul, command of all the legions of ltaly... and the abolition of senatorial authority over the courts.

## you've done what?
i've made a little deal with the cilician pirates.

## how far are we from brundusium?
about 20 miles.

## what is it?
pompey and his army has landed in ltaly.

## lucullus here?
you have no ships.

## there are no ships at all?
cilician pirates can destroy any roman fleet that ever sailed.

## why did the cilicians run away?
they were paid.

## who?
crassus.

## why would he bribe your pirates to keep us from escaping?
i don't know.

## crassus is inviting us to march on rome... so he can take the fiield against us.
how can i answer when there is no answer?

## you mean crassus wants us to march on rome?
he's forcing us to.

## what do you think, general?
go away.

## go away?
tell the trumpeters to sound assembly.

## have your dispositions been made?
each maniple knows its position in line, sir, and exactly what's expected.

## changed?
spartacus takes too keen an interest in our plans, i fear.

## who?
the lanista, sir.

## what?
in the ring.

## when?
when you visited my school with those two charming ladies.

## what?
i trust they're both in good health.

## spartacus was the opponent?
yes.

## that's a matter of some importance to your highness?
yes, to every man who loves rome and wishes to see her strong.

## could not the agent for that sale be he... who shares this tiny moment of history with your honour?
i authorize you to be the agent for the sale of all survivors.

## after the battle?
you misunderstand me.

## iooking for you?
in such circumstances, i have no doubt... you will be helping him.

## when do we go home?
go to sleep, dear.

## no pains yet?
he's a bad child, though.

## can you feel it?
no, i don't.

## what do you pray for?
yes, i did.

## does it hurt you?
that was so strong.

## have we a count of prisoners?
we haven't made the fiinal count, sir.

## you're the woman of spartacus?
i'm his wife.

## and this is his child?
yes.

## where is spartacus?
dead.

## did you see him killed?
yes.

## where is he?
at least here is someone worth selling, your enormity.

## how many women have been taken?
under forty, sir.

## what is that?
don't laugh at me, but i believe it to be dignity.

## you think so?
anyone who believes i'll turn informer for nothing is a fool.

## beautiful?
well, beautiful.

## proud?
proud, proud.

## why?
i can no longer hurt crassus in the senate... but i can hurt him where he'll feel it most:in his pride.

## this time you've come to teach.
would half a million sesterces make you brave?

## am i arrested?
already the bodies of 6, 000 crucifiied slaves...

## where does my name appear... on the list of disloyal enemies of the state?
first.

## why am i to be left so conspicuously alive?
that's better.

## will you have some squab and honey?
no.

## and a piece of melon?
and some wine, of course.

## why am i here?
good question.

## the infant it thrives?
he thrives.

## why do you threaten me with my baby?
i belong to you.

## you think by threatening to kill my child... you'll make me love you?
i did not threaten to kill your child.

## do i interfere with your memories?
no.

## well, then... what sort of a man was he... really?
he was a man who began all alone...

## was he a god?
he wasn't a god.

## why did you love him?
i can't tell you.

## don't you see?
i must understand.

## you're afraid of him, aren't you?
that's why you want his wife... to soothe your fear by having something he had.

## could we ever have won?
just by fiighting them, we won something.

## are you afraid to die, spartacus?
no more than i was to be born.

## are you afraid?
yes.

## where are the gladiators?
over there, sir.

## you are he... aren't you?
gladiator, i'm marcus licinius crassus.

## i wonder what spartacus would say... if he knew that the woman, varinia, and her child... are slaves in my household?
yes.

## did you fear him, crassus?
not when i fought him.

## me?
we've been hiding.

## where are we going?
you're going to aquitania.

## why do i have to go to aquitania?
it's very good of you, gracchus, but i'd rather

## two million?
here.

## where are you going?
to picenum.

## picenum?
that's the dreariest town in ltaly.

## will you please leave me?
come with us.

## will you please go before the soldiers come here?
this would really make crassus jealous.

## what did you say?
come on.

## and if you die, who will tell that story?
live, so that i will live.

## did you see the look he gave you, varinia?
i didn't.

## but the fighting never stopped.
what sort of look?

## fishing for votes?
no, just enjoying our democratic way of life.

## any news from spain along with the wine?
a great victory by pompey.

## another?
the man is positively boring in his triumphs.

## what brings you up from capua?
the same thing as you, i would imagine.

## a modest man from the country?
yours is widely known as the finest gladiatorial school in all italy.

## why, batiatus, are you in love?
it would be a close vote.

## am i?
well, i suppose i might be.

## what is hell?
worse.

## some say he can't.
what kind of a place is this?

## you're thracians?
the crowd likes thracians.

## why not?
i might meet you in the arena some day, and then i'll kill you.

## why wait?
you'll have plenty of chances to fight.

## who hasn't?
crixus the big nose.

## where did you learn to fight?
when a roman asks you a question, you answer, slave.

## why is it that the rich are always so keen on reform... after they've made their fortune and not before?
the republic was a fine form of government... when rome was a backwater city state.

## or by pompey?
plato did say that leadership must be left to the educated.

## was it something i said?
they have spirit, but no real talent.

## so you think they're just very lucky?
and cinna... this boy was very expensive.

## how's your nose?
you got lucky.

## so where did you fight romans?
thrace.

## you?
gaul, where i was caught.

## you rebelled?
two times.

## why did it fail?
i amuses the romans to turn us into fishermen.

## in the ring, draba, they ever pit the knife against the spear?
tomorrow some of you have the honor... of fighting in the arena in capua.

## lost your appetite?
eat.

## you don't believe in the gods?
when i look at the heavens i see only stars.

## so what do you believe in?
us.

## what happens tonight?
war, little thracian.

## what are you called?
you look cold.

## where are they going?
capua.

## is he any good?
couldn't say.

## how?
all the gladiators here are strong men.

## you were with him last night?
yes and no.

## aren't we?
yes, my lord.

## who are they?
arsonists.

## change your mind about the gods?
if there are gods in this world... they're not here.

## this new gladiator, spartacus, is he really a thracian... or are you still passing off greeks?
he's the real thing, through and through.

## any good?
cinna thinks the world of him.

## don't you, cinna?
because cinna ordered it.

## on what would you make a vow?
on the blood that flows... through my veins and the breath i take...

## can you tell there's life after?
i have faith.

## marcus crassus is here... and you left him waiting outside?
noble crassus.

## how may i serve you?
my friends and i'd appreciate... a private showing of a pair of thracians.

## to the death?
that's an unusual request for a private showing.

## don't you agree, slave master?
a private fight.

## who do you want?
draba.

## now, he's a jew, yes?
yes, i know you want a thracian...

## ever seen a jew fight?
exceptional with the dagger and reputed to be very bright as well.

## who else?
spartacus and polymus.

## how do you like them?
all.

## who will you match him with?
with the african.

## what are you doing?
praying.

## how do you pray?
i can show you.

## something that we do in our tribe?
put your mouth on mine and breath your soul into me... and i'll breath mine into you.

## what kind of match is that?
gladiators are animals, pure and simple.

## would you like to see?
bring me the jew before he fights.

## they do that to their children?
if he kills me, he lives.

## who chooses to die?
if a man throw his life away...

## will you die any better?
he will die like a dog, and so will you.

## was draba your friend?
yes.

## did he teach you how to die?
he taught me how to live.

## and what do i get in return?
treachery.

## nordo, can you open the armory?
lf i have to do it with my teeth.

## what do you want me to say?
invite our brothers to join us.

## where's that slaves headed?
in the hills to the south of here.

## so?
so if attacked, they'd have to fight, man to man.

## and who fights better man to man than gladiators?
crixus, nordo.

## should we not greet them?
apparently there has been an uprising of gladiators in capua.

## who are they led by?
it sounds like a job for an overseer and a pack of dogs.

## will the slaves wait?
i don't think so.

## but the entire city cohorts?
three.

## under whose command?
i realize that it is not customary for a man to put his own name.

## how are we going to feed them or clothe them... much less train them to fight the roman empire?
by teaching them to share the burden.

## why did you propose glabrus?
he's as thick as he is vain.

## why don't put yourself forward?
agrippa would have blocked me out of sheer spite.

## and to where?
i want to go home.

## can you bend this?
now all of these.

## who will lead us?
stand up if you want to lead.

## what are they?
whatever we take... we hold together.

## we're one tribe then?
yes.

## is that your will?
whoever you are... you are blocking the path of a citizen of rome.

## are you sure?
that is what it says.

## does that trouble you?
well, i'll do what i can to raise myself, but i make no promises.

## we're going to have a child?
the slave army's climbing the north wall of the mountain, my lord.

## why don't we push on, my lord?
cut off the slaves before they reach the mountains.

## what's a woman doing here?
she has every right to be here.

## do women lead your armies?
is that why jews...

## what's the excuse of the gauls?
david has news for us.

## what's your plan?
i don't have one.

## you don't have a plan?
from the moment i stood up in the training yard...

## why must i?
i'm no different from any of you.

## that we're all equal?
yes, but...

## and why should you?
you're the only possible choice.

## within the soul you say i have?
yes.

## my lord, is it true you've given the troops permission to camp... without building the usual defensive fortifications?
the men are tired and i am tired.

## how is it that you were spared?
i don't know why they chose me.

## what do we have to talk to him about?
a lot.

## you here to do business or flatter me?
you've done well.

## for yourself?
for all of us.

## so how many trunks of gold?
at least five more like this.

## when we are ready how do i signal you?
get to the coast and fly this... where it can be seen from the sea.

## orsino or crixus?
either one.

## is this wise?
as long as they obey the laws it's better to let them have their way.

## with what?
thanks to your haste, we'll be 3 months rebuilding the garrison.

## and while we do that, what would rome do?
recall their legions.

## what do you propose that we do?
i say we make the price of rebellion... painfully clear.

## what is it?
two hundred roman slaves... picked at random... and burned alive this morning.

## varinia?
she must rest.

## if we let them go?
it pains me to say it... but crassus is right.

## if spartacus defeats this army and turns on rome... where will your precious little democracy be then?
it reminds me of the nestros valley where i grew up.

## you still have kin there?
no.

## how?
he was the village headsman.

## did you notice on the road how quiet it was?
the slaves have stopped joining us.

## can we get around them?
they've picked their site well.

## and who's their general?
publius maximus.

## what do we know about him?
publius runs his army with a firm hand.

## how do we fight that?
i remember a story about hannibal fighting a rock.

## and?
those we didn't kill we drove off.

## in which direction?
south, i think.

## what are you doing out here?
thinking.

## am i in danger?
she's carrying my child.

## what is it?
crixus.

## why should we leave?
rome threw their best at us...

## why should we run?
but let's not settle for a little plunder.

## what kind of man am i dealing with?
everybody blames me for this mess.

## spartacus?
yes, yes.

## you mean varinia?
that bitch from hell disguised as an angel.

## how did he become a slave?
they say that... as a young boy... he watched his father crucified.

## how can i desert them?
you are an honorable man.

## don't the legions traditionally cheer rome when they depart?
crassus thinks he is rome.

## orsino?
if you betray us i'll find you wherever you go...

## how many legions?
i count six standards.

## commander?
we caught one of their scouts.

## you're uneasy, my lord?
it is a warrior's answer...

## and how do you know?
we've met this man.

## is that wise?
both glabrus and publius played into his hands.

## but in order to do that he had to split his forces.
why share the glory that could be ours alone?

## how long do you think before they reach our front lines?
kill them.

## who would throw away a fortune?
aristocrats.

## what would rome pay to have them back?
we could live well on the ransom.

## roman citizens?
discipline distinguishes the roman army... from every other army in the world.

## and where is spartacus now?
traveling south, tracked by my troops.

## do you think that spartacus will sit... and wait patiently for him to arrive?
he is a contaminating parasite.

## the question is what?
orsino.

## may i offer you something to eat?
no.

## and why would you conclude that?
because it's all he can do.

## how long do you think it will take them to get here?
by tomorrow.

## where did you acquire the arrogance to believe that you could... challenge the undefeated roman empire?
i have you to thank.

## he inspired you?
he showed me how to fight back.

## do you?
my scouts tell me that pompey has been recalled.

## what glory will be left for you when he arrives?
i will destroy your army... and then i will wipe away even the memory of your existence... from the face of this earth.

## how could you crucify?
the romans need to be reminded that we are not beaten.

## that's supposed to justify it?
north.

## may i ask the cost to bring that?
well, it was very expensive... but it was worth it.

## attack crassus?
insane.

## who led us to the trap at rhegium?
where my feet take me.

## have you enough food?
lf we don't, romans will give us.

## who else can say that?
no one.

## where are the gauls headed?
they're making camp on the shores of lake lucania.

## the child is well?
i think he will be a blacksmith, the way he hammers on me.

## and be a slave again?
you haven't the right to ask that of me.

## not to your son?
you were right, varinia.

## and if you die, who will tell that story?
we think he was a close friend of spartacus.

## and i have stamped out... the greatest threat... that rome has known since carthage.
what is your name?

## and i am to be rewarded... with some trivial, secondary honor?
senators, this is a day for rome to rejoice.

## and now for candidates could there be... any more qualified, more deserving... than these two glorious heroes?
and therefore i propose... that pompey and crassus both be made consul.

## what was he like?
he was just a man.

## if you already have the answer to your question then why ask it?
because you waste your tears on him.

## then why does he still matter to you?
spartacus was something the world has never seen before.

## do you still have nothing to say?
i will be back.

## don't you mean crassus?
caesar is the real beneficiary here.

## what have we done?
now tell me some dirt.

## even now, this varinia?
war trophy, i imagine.

## can i have a drink?
help yourself.

## are you out of your mind?
it would be suicide.

## you know why i am so much more popular than you, crassus?
because it's only natural to prefer the rising sun... to the one that sets.

## why have you done this?
but the more i thought about it, well...

## a foolish old man's last gesture... of redemption maybe?
after i sobered up yesterday...

## do you know what i think?
i think that you fought for your freedom... for your children's lives... the honor of your women... and all that is good in the world.

## and rome fought for what?
the whip and the cross.

## what is your son's name?
spartacus.

## where is she?
you're safe now.

## and how does the story end?
i don't know, spartacus.

## and if you die, who will tell that story?
live so that i will live.

## did you see the look he gave you, varinia?
i didn't.

## agrippa.
what sort of look?

## fishing for votes?
no, just enjoying our democratic way of life.

## any news from spain?

## you have any more l 47s?
yeah, maybe in the car.

## would you let him out?
oh, sorry.

yes, i'm fine, dear.

## what the?
there you are.

## guns are very dangerous things, all right?
right.

## where'd he go?
we meet again...... eddie yang.

## where's the boy?
my guest is no concern of yours.

## are you crazy?
be careful.

## excuse me.
jai, are you all right?

## we can take whatever we choose.
you looking for something?

## i mean, what difference can a single human life like hers make to us?
we are immortal.

## can you?
it's your turn.

## what's that for?
of course...... when he came back, he was naked.

## i don't suppose you'd consider a rub on your medallion?
i really am.

## quiet on the set.
hello?

## are cameras ready?
cameras are ready.

## can you overlap that line for me?
eddie yang.

## will you say action, or am i just...?
i did.

## three months and not so much as a phone call?
that made me so nervous.

## you now, how?
it's giscard.

## what about snakehead?
snakehead is not here yet.

## what about ken?
yeah.

## pete?
pete is just right beside me.

## what?
it's no, you no.

## what's this?
the bottom.

## are you doing on purpose?
try it again, claire.

## how do you plan to get inside it?
we're pretty sure we found a way in.

## i'll assist you.
do you really believe we haven't considered that?

## what have we missed?
the reptilians took the weapon.

## have they launched it?
we don't know.

## who?
reptilians, insectoids...

## where's corporal hawkins?
the sphere had an automated defense mechanism.

## where are they?
we are trying to determine their location.

## what about the aquatics?
their actions aren't easy to predict, but so far they seem determined not to take sides.

## you believe they'll use her to decrypt the arming sequence?
she'll never cooperate.

## you okay?
i'm fond of hoshi as well.

## any luck?
there's a great deal of data to analyze, but we've made some progress.

## integral how?
i believe they act as control spheres, allowing the network to operate in concert.

## if we can damage one of them, would it disrupt the entire grid?
maybe.

## why have they stopped?
they could've been halfway to earth by now.

## how quickly can we get there?
that wouldn't be wise.

## would the aquatics be a match for them?
their ships are extremely powerful.

## can they afford to sit back and do nothing?
let me talk to them.

## so we should leave our fate in the hands of the reptilians and insectoids?
i disagree.

## how long do they plan to keep us waiting?
you have to deal with the aquatics on their terms.

## you all right?
my species doesn't like the water.

## and if my world gets torn to rubble in the meantime...?
the reptilians and the insectoids cannot deploy the weapon on their own.

## so, you'd rather sit back and do nothing?
captain! while they condemn all five of your species to extinction.

## is it here in the expanse?
in case you haven't noticed, the spheres are turning it into a trans dimensional wasteland.

## have they ever tried to disable the spheres?
because we've found a way.

## do you understand what we want you to do?
i'm to bypass the aquatic encryption protocols.

## and i'm trying not to make a liar out of him.
are you?

## what do you mean by that?
you've dismissed all of my proposals.

## why don't we take another crack at this?
the council has disbanded.

## really?
you've seen more than enough detail to learn how to meddle in our affairs to turn the xindi species against each other.

## what they used to connect the spheres?
that's what we're thinking.

## any word?
it's only been three hours.

## what's to prevent us from building another one?
i knew degra for many years.

## and?
we will help you intercept the weapon.

## how do these developments affect the timeline?
it's difficult to say.

## is there another problem?
quite the opposite.

## the third launch code?
we have complete access.

## have you assembled your boarding party?
ready to deploy on your command.

## would you like to go over my rescue plan?
first, i'd like to know if... we have a problem.

## sir?
if you blame me for the corporal's death.

## permission to speak freely?
i've never liked putting my people under someone else's command.

## what about you?
you may buy me a drink, if you wish.

## can you imagine the look on soval's face when he sees her in a starfleet uniform?
please let me be there.

## what is it?
a vortex is opening.

## where?
bearing 2 7 9, range 4, 000 kilometers.

## were you expecting reinforcements?
no.

## feel like taking them on?
give me the word, sir.

## can you get a transporter lock?
she's somewhere on the first three decks.

## can you hold your position?
affirmative.

## and the anomalies?
they've disabled three of the aquatic ships.

## what's your status?
we've completed the arming sequence.

## what about the anomalies?
i said, take us in.

## how's ensign sato?
her bio signs are stable.

## what?
she knows the team.

## how long before it reaches earth?
ten hours.

## could an aquatic ship reach it in time?
doubtful.

## what are we waiting for?
the ship isn't well armed.

## are you ready?
i believe so.

## how is she?
stable.

## sir?
i won't risk any more interference.

## can we pass through there?
our ships weren't designed for twist pressures over one googol fluxoms.

## hey, i can see it's a water gun.
why's everybody talk back all the time?

## just a second, sir.
what?

## that's three hot dogs and a sausage roll, to eat here?
at this, i mean.

## what, the vulgar rocket ship?
we sold it to some russian scientist type for top dollar.

## who?
vladimir something, i forget.

## where's this vladimir live then?
chanistanya nuclear plant, i think.

## who the hell gave you permission to sell the ship, you son of a bitch?
we're off to russia, numbskull.

## kooling system problems, but that's what you do best, right?
go check out the reaktor chamber.

## chernobyl. why's zat sound familiar?
the negotiations with the russian president had also gone well.

## are we all set to go?
yes, sir.

## so you're the famous emperor pirk?
this is me, in all my glory.

## what is it?
no, they just whined about famine and overpopulation and stuff.

## it had one occupant... human.
what's this racket?

## how did a one man craft get this far from earth?
we saw a ship in epsilon ouadrant.

## we had a meeting at two o'clock.
huh?

## didn't it occur to you it might be two pm, wiseguy?
your expression was ambiguous, sir.

## what about it?
yeah, yeah, get to the point.

## any questions?
meanwhile in a parallel universe...

## what're you going on about?
lt kefir took a star flurry for a drunken joyride last night.

## why didn't you stop him?
i was so dru... dreadfully tired.

## where's kefir now?
in the morning, i sent a patrol out.

## where did that ship come from?
dunno.

## what?
the prophecies of the minibar are coming true.

## now, let's get back to reality, huh?
an itching nose must be scratched.

## how many?
sir, we're being hailed.

## is the planet habitable?
not according to the scanners, sir.

## where are you guys from, anyway?
this station is neutral territory.

## we haven't been here before?
emperor, i assume we have arrived in a mirror dimension of our own world.

## so do you know where their earth is?
in theory, yes, assuming that our star charts have the same stars.

## tell me, can we beat them?
given that we have deflector plates and they do not, it is possible...

## don't shoot, we have over 250, 000 civilians here.
yes, or no?

## why don't you bring your crew over for some shore leave?
well... lemme consider this.

## why?
i feel it in my bones, we won't be coming back.

## oh yeah?
he couldn't stand defeat.

## where would you like to start, sir?
naah...

## wait a minute... what's that?
nothing, just a screen saver.

## where's captain giddyup?
he was feeling unwell, and had to leave the ship under my command.

## my sled...
how about i'll just scoot off?

## i'll see to it that you die slowly, and have time to regret everything.
going somewhere, emperor?

## hayday to fleet.
didn't anyone ever tell you your bootlaces are too long?

## additionally, our twinkle beams are powerless against their flagship.
are your crews back from r& r yet?

## what the hell... are we armed with twinklers or flashlights?
light balls seem to work better, but the kickstart only has nine left.

## and where is our friend the kickstart?
unknown, sir. the blackout caused the targeting computer to reboot, so we lost lock on.

## lt. makarov, how are the repairs?
it'll be open in 10 minutes, sir.

## that russkie coward been holding back again?
if we ask capt fukov to deliver his light balls to us, we can close in...

## what've you done?
not one hit, but your ship is in pieces.

## come again?
you're breaking up.

## should we withdraw to regroup?
no.

## have you located the kickstart yet?
yes, sir.

## this is the light ball loader, what do i do with light balls?
ah, the emperor. we meet at last.

## erm, i take it that the defense grid has been activated?
it would be, if there was anything left of it.

## are you drunk?
no.

## what?
i disconnected the cooling system.

## wanna drink?
babel 1 3 surrenders unconditionally.

## but don't you think it'd be better to shoot from a closer range?
beams traveling across all that space would waste a lot of energy.

## we need to hurry, things are so hot.
what?

## did you inform the fleet or what?
yeah, captain carlo answered.

## who's carlo?
critical mass in 38 seconds.

## info, where the hell are we, anyway?
one moment.

## what the hell?
this end of the maggot hole must have shifted in time space.

## how about letting us know where the hell we are?
hawaii, on earth.

## so where are all the surfers and hula hula dancers, smart guy?
some 1 1, 000 years in the future.

## what?
i assume the maggot hole put us on earth, during the ice age.

## how about shooting ourselves before the twinklers freeze?
in a low power mode, i believe i can make it until the 21st century, and prevent the fateful invasion campaign from taking place.

## i can't believe you're moving.
so that none of this ever happened?

## do you know what happens to girls who start high school with no best friend, no guy, and low social standing?
nothing.

## i never truly had an image, did i?
start now.

## what's this?
i thought we were done with junior high.

## you read all these books?
yeah, many times.

## me?
yeah, sure.

## i'm doing the dance.
hey, hey, what's this?

## the high school dance?
we used to be best friends.

## so this is our future?
your future.

## how am i supposed to do high school without you?
there it is... the high school lunch spot.

## isn't it great?
he can't see me, not at all.

## we've got ladybug cups...
stuff?

## ladybug plates... and a ladybug pi?
ata.

## aren't these antenna boppers just a hoot, hannah?
look.

## what happened to his car?
repossessed.

## and why not?
because we don't need a babysitter.

## i'm finally back on speaking terms with the mulligans, okay?
mom, go.

## but you're still gonna walk shep, aren't you?
yeah.

## somebody's about to meet their new best friend.
where did you come from?

## are you sure this is the one, owen?
it's your call, o.

## what?
owen helped me nab that tough mutt off the street.

## is he stray?
there are no tags around his neck.

## what do you mean?
attitude.

## attitude?
yeah.

## you wouldn't put him to sleep, though, right?
well...

## and who is this?
his name's hubble.

## where's nelly?
she likes to check out the headlines.

## okay, mr. genius, how about... roll over?
play dead.

## here?
i...

## how could i let this happen?
don't say a word.

## did you just learn how to talk?
here come the questions.

## how is this even possible?
oh, boy.

## leaders?
the dogs who walk you.

## am i the only one who can understand you?
okay, it was a big mistake... wasn't meant to happen.

## got it?
watch out, shorty.

## right now, you understand what i am saying to you?
yep.

## can i have a cookie?
no, wait.

## no, can i have twenty cookies?
be a pal, kid.

## hold it.
owen, honey, can we just talk about how pretty i am?

## where are you from?
where we all came from... the home star.

## what are you talking about?
thousands of years ago, dogs arrived here from the home star to colonize and dominate the planet.

## dude, you never heard of the dog star?
it's called sirius.

## wait, you know about this, too?
my grandma used to tell me stories.

## you expect me to believe that there's a planet out there made up of only dogs?
we don't expect much from your species.

## pardon me, but you were saying something about a mission?
right.

## what, like a report card?
yes.

## we're going to get graded?
yes, and i'll be submitting my report directly to our most noble pack leader... the greater dane.

## that is crazy.
what?

## isn't that crazy?
super crazy.

## you don't honestly think that dogs are in charge...
who would say a crazy thing like that?

## can we get some air?
i feel a little woozy.

## see this?
i bought it.

## baker!
yeah.

## you know how to drive?
he knows how to crash.

## what's this thing?
be careful.

## this is what you were using last night?
yes, when it short circuited and you were caught in the current.

## when did these human dog relationships start anyway?
thousands of years ago.

## friend?
dogs don't need friends.

## why?
yeah.

## you okay?
i'm okay.

## why do you do that?
because i need sleep.

## why do you turn around like that?
enough with the questions.

## hubble?
just one more.

## how could dogs run an entire planet all on their own?
i mean, no offense, but you guys don't have that much intelligence.

## who's been teaching who all day long, mr. genius?
you may know about where you live, but i know a lot more about where i live.

## why?
because, honey, you do not want to deal with me until i've had my day at the beauty parlor.

## so, what do you think, mr. space dog?
you're all pets.

## what do you think?
now i have no choice.

## flunk them?
we can't flunk.

## i make my report, and i go.
maybe if you helped us refresh our memory a little?

## what do you mean, go?
mission command will send a retriever for me eventually.

## who are we kidding?
we could only dream of being as dignified as hubble.

## understand?
tomorrow, you start getting serious.

## i know.
another fine example of the intelligence of human beings?

## finally, right?
i can't wait to get started on the new place in metro village.

## so soon?
it's our dream home, honey.

## and besides, every time we move, we get a nicer place, right?
but this place seems nice enough to me.

## honey, can you move out?
i want to get the painting by itself.

## where were you?
with my mom.

## why do dogs howl at the moon?
only coyotes do that, but it's not the moon.

## sirius?
just to the left, two stars over.

## so when that retriever you talked about comes for you, you're planning on going back with him?
this is only a temporary mission.

## hey, was that a ball?
i coulda swore i just heard a ball.

## was that a ball?
i do believe there was a ball.

## whatcha gonna do now, baker?
just get up slowly.

## is this your only one?
just keep it.

## why do you hang out with them?
i don't know.

## could you watch the dogs?
i'm gonna check on hubble.

## why did you step in like that?
they were throwing rocks at you.

## why would you put yourself at risk for me?
because... you're my dog.

## besides, that's what friends do, right?
you backed me up, too.

## why would i do a stupid thing like that?
i think they wanna play ball.

## doesn't your dog wanna play?
he's fine.

## now what is up with your dog?
you won't believe me.

## so that rock around your neck... is this from outer space?
we all wear them.

## what's it mean?
it means... home.

## see what my dad built for you?
if you lived here, you'd have your very own house.

## aren't you 3942?
oh, 3942.

## arrival?
repeat.

## when?
hey, it's getting late, guys.

## what was that?
nothing.

## you all right?
no, i'm fine.

## the greater dane is a she?
of course.

## so?
we'll do it.

## what order?
come on, hubble.

## what's the worst thing she can do?
global recall.

## global what?
recall.

## why would she?
i told you.

## us talking right now... that's a problem, remember?
i did that.

## is it chilly out here for you, nelly?
we'll take you inside, warm you up.

## who's gonna be your best friend?
when the greater dane arrives, we must welcome her with dignified pageantry.

## strung up?
not my tail.

## what did he say?
he's a little stressed out.

## you all understand that you're being asked to prove yourselves, right?
to prove that you're worthy to live here, to stay with the people you love.

## oh, isn't it lovely to be here?
la dee dah, la dee dah, et cetera and so forth.

## not bad?
that was cool.

## now, have you figured out a way to convince her we're in charge?
connie had an idea.

## can i just have a bite right now?
medium rare.

## is that chicken bits?
no, sweetheart, that's pt.

## has any other greater dane ever visited earth before this?
you're talking to me.

## what's the point if you're not gonna be here long enough to play?
oh, right.

## are you... agitated?
yep, but it's not about you.

## you want a biscuit?
no.

## why do you do those circles?
i'm building a mind fence.

## excuse me?
a mind fence.

## never?
sounded like a sonic boom.

## that was a sonic boom?
the greater dane.

## that is not a dog.
can someone tell her to stay in focus, please?

## what is that thing?
that's a rat with a wig.

## we were all wondering when you were gonna get your royal heinie down here.
what's the matter with all of you?

## can i bite him?
oh, you're all dog meat now.

## what's happening?
nothing good.

## did you know that?
people and dogs love each other.

## you did this?
it's not hubble's fault.

## love?
here they come.

## what happened?
she decided to go home.

## is it all over?
it's all over.

## are you... here?
i'm... here.

## where's everybody going?
i think everyone's tired.

## well, we can celebrate later, right?
now we can play ball, hub.

## it's who you're with, right?
yeah.

## what is it, shep?
my pretty ladybird.

## wilson?
that's my girl.

## what?
i know i haven't been the most affectionate dog.

## how many people get to hear that from their dog?
owen.

## mom?
honey, miss ryan is at the door.

## what about?
i know barbara ann's every move.

## you're not saying owen took the dogs?
no.

## where does that leave us?
it's not owen's fault.

## who took them?
the dogs.

## it's because of all this constant moving we've been doing, isn't it?
i'm sure it's not helping.

## what do we do?
here you go.

## where's your cap?
i can't find it.

## a home?
it seems that inspires great loyalty.

## i must ask you now... where does your loyalty lie?
3942.

## dad, was that another sonic boom?
stop the car.

## something's going on.
what?

## what?
the dogs.

## what was that?
now, wait a minute.

## this button, right?
you broke it.

## say hi, shep.
is that the dogs?

## are you here...... to stay?
yep.

## you heard?
hubble.

## how am i gonna know what you're thinking?
hello, teddy.

## what'd you say?
there's a boy in a cage.

## a boy?
a real boy.

## in the pen, honey?
in the jail place.

## random crowd reaction hey, russell, we got a remote near the pig pen?
standing by.

## honey, how do you know about this?
history repeats itself.

## my time, is it up already?
all right, thanks, mike.

## hey, what's your name?
i won't bite you.

## is he a toy boy?
my name is david.

## i still work, don't i?
i can work in the dark, but my lamp is broken.

## what would be the point?
he could be a custom job.

## david?
you are one of a kind.

## who made you?
my mommy made me.

## her womb was your factory, huh?
monica is my mommy.

## you thinking of not putting him in the show?
something as original as this, you don't toss out with the rest of the garbage.

## what are you gonna do with him?
put him where he belongs.

## what will they think of next?
see here.

## who is that?
he looks like a boy.

## we found him.
see how they try to imitate our emotions now?

## where?
a flesh fair outside haddonfield.

## is he alive?
yes.

## is it real?
i don't know, david.

## i sit coming?
i can't tell yet.

## where are we going?
this way now.

## have you run away from someone?
my mommy told me to run away.

## why did she say that?
i guess... because henry didn't like me.

## why was that?
martin came home.

## and who is he?
martin is mommy and henry's real son.

## and i know where most of them can be found.
is blue fairy mecha, orga, man or woman?

## where?
rouge city.

## are there many women in rouge city?
as there are stars at night.

## how will we find just one?
we will ask dr. know.

## exactly what name do you give this woman?
she is... just blue fairy.

## why do you do that?
that's just what i do.

## don't they just?
there are girls your age who are just like me.

## are you her?
that's our lady of the immaculate heart.

## flat fact?
thank you for question number one.

## where is blue fairy?
in the garden.

## are you sad, lonely, looking for a friend?
blue fairy escort service will find a mate for you.

## joe?
try fairy tale.

## but i think we're getting closer.
what is blue fairy?

## but if a fairy tale is real, then wouldn't it be fact a flat fact?
say no more.

## how can the blue fairy... make... a robot... into a real live boy?
your quest will be perilous, yet there ward is beyond price.

## in his book, how can a robot become human?
professor allen hobby writes of the power... which will transform mecha into orga.

## will you tell me how to find her?
the supernatural is the hidden web that unites the universe.

## or what if the blue fairy is an electronic parasite... that has a reason to haunt the minds of artificial intelligence?
they hate us, you know the humans.

## destination?
manhattan.

## is this the place they make you real?
this is the place they make you read.

## are you real?
i guess.

## are you me?
i'm david.

## can you sit down and we can read together?
let's be friends.

## david?
i'm david.

## professor hobby?
yes, david, i've been waiting for you.

## is blue fairy here too?
i first heard of your blue fairy from monica.

## what did you believe the blue fairy could do for you?
she would make me a real boy.

## david, do you have any idea what a success story you've become?
you found a fairy tale... and inspired by love, fueled by desire, you set out on a journey to make her real.

## where would your self motivated reasoning take you?
and that is something no machine has ever done until you.

## would you like to come meet your real mothers and fathers?
the team is anxious to talk to you.

## the blue fairy's all right.
she is?

## what happened?
i don't know.

## blue fairy?
please.

## blue fairy?
david.

## you have been searching for me, haven't you, david?
for my whole life.

## and what, after all this time, have you come to ask me?
i have a wish to make.

## and what is your wish?
please make me a real boy... so my mommy will love me and let me stay with her.

## where am i?
this looks like my house, but it is different.

## is she out shopping with martin now?
david, she can never come home... because 2, 000 years have passed, and she is no longer living.

## if you can bring back other people, why can't you bring back her?
because we can only bring back people... whose bodies we dig up from the ice.

## do you remember when you cut some of mommy's hair?
henry shook me.

## and you dropped her hair?
i know.

## now you can bring her back, can't you?
give him what he wants.

## hey, joe, what do ya know?
david, i often felt a sort of envy of human beings... of that thing they called spirit.

## and you know what we found?
we found the very fabric of space time itself... appeared to store information... about every event which had ever occurred in the past.

## can you hear that?
the new morning has come.

## just the way you like it?
yeah, i'd love a coffee.

## you never forget how, do you?
no.

## what day is it?
it is... today.

## shocked?
i don't understand.

## what did i do to your feelings?
you did it to my hand.

## we are rightly proud of it, but what does it amount to?
sheila, open.

## love?
but we ship thousands of lover models every month.

## a robot child who will genuinely love... the parent or parents it imprints on... with a love that will never end.
what is love?

## a child substitute mecha?
but a mecha with a mind, with neuronal feedback.

## a robot that dreams?
yes.

## but isn't the real conundrum, can you get a human to love them back?
ours will be a perfect child caught in a freeze frame... always loving, never ill, never changing.

## it's a moral question, isn't it?
the oldest one of all.

## they talked about these virus locators, hello again, monica. microscopic synthetic hunter killers.
but in the beginning, didn't god create adam to love him?

## did you read that article?
i can still hear you.

## henry, what are you doing?
i love you.

## what were you thinking?
shh.

## no, he's not.
i mean, henry, did you see his face?

## i mean, inside he's like all the rest, isn't he?
a hundred miles of fiber, yeah.

## would you like me to sleep now?
uh, well, it's late, you know.

## how how late do they let you stay up?
i can never go to sleep.

## dress me?
you know, i'm gonna say good night while you boys be boys.

## is it a game?
now, i'm gonna read some words.

## can you do that?
yes, monica.

## can you feel my hand on the back of your neck?
yes.

## does any of this hurt?
no.

## ready?
mommy.

## who am i, david?
you are my mommy.

## will you still love me when it's all gone?
no.

## walk us out, all right, sweet heart?
come on.

## do i smell lovely?
oh, god, no.

## mommy, will you die?
well, one day, david, yes, i will.

## how long will you live?
for ages.

## hello?
this belonged to martin, my son.

## henry?
sorry.

## what were you doing up there?
i'll tell you in the car.

## is 50 years a long time?
i don't think so.

## mrs. swinton, could you hold a moment?
i have an urgent call from your husband.

## can you hear me, monica?
let the phone talk now.

## when?
he used to be a super toy, but now he's old and stupid.

## you want him?
yes, please.

yes.

## how could you see that coming?
i have no idea.

## do they really have a weight problem?
so do i.

## does he eat?

## is it in the manual book?
stop it.

## can you locate the service?
don't touch the merchandise.

## what shall i do?
you have to promise, and then i'll tell you.

## why did you do that?
henry, i wanted mommy to love me... more.

## what?
i think i cut my eye.

## why do you keep imagining that he was purposely trying to harm me?
because we don't know the answer to that.

## how is he worth the risk to you or to martin or to us as a family?
i will not let you take him back.

## and if pushed to those extremes, what is he really capable of?
happy birthday, martin.

## is this your little brother?
technically, no.

## what's mecha?
we're organic, you're mechanical.

## can you pee?
i cannot.

## thank god.
does he have das?

## mommy.
hey, david?

## i i need to speak to you for a minute, okay?

## and teddy?
yeah, and teddy.

## why did you decide to go into baking so late in life?
i thought they were bsing me.

## really?
yeah, cos someone gives you something they cooked you always say you enjoy it even if you threw up, so, you know.

## what are your duties as chairman?
the board meets twice a week and we take up issues.

## issues?
yeah, facts, problems, things like that.

## what problems does an overnight success like sunset farms face?
i figured if a guy's staring at a naked piece of tail, he sees the breasts and the legs, he's gonna salivate.

## pablo?
well, all the chocolate chips are put in by hand and that's really hard on the back and the leg muscles.

## you wanted to check the menu?
right.

## what did we say for openers?
yeah, snails.

## every time i come home it's like walking into a strange house.
did you rearrange this again?

## did i tell you to get rid of this?
it's a harp.

## what's it doing in the living room?
i like the visual sweep.

## what's for dinner?
it's the dinner party.

## are you nuts?
i'm gonna have a snail?.

## jesus, what happened to all the turkey meatballs and spaghetti?
have a potato and truffle thing, that'll hold you.

## what's so big about tonight?
there's a lot of important arts people coming.

## is that so terrible?
but when we talked about making it, we were gonna hit it big, move to florida, swim, eat stone crabs...

## you'd come out, remember you'd give it a little of this?
those days are over.

## what good is that if i can't get a cheeseburger?
ray, please, be charming tonight.

## just evian, or perrier?
certainly.

## have you seen it?
no, not yet.

## ray, why are we standing in the hallway?
please, let's retire to the living room.

## are you a fan of the ballet, mrs winkler?
i used to be a dancer, but, please, call me fren... frances.

## the foxes from saratoga?
i don't know, i never checked my pedigree.

## can we change the music?
i feel like i should be wearing a wig.

## did you do the place yourself?
they say i have a flair for decorating.

## it lights?
no, it's a visual, honey.

## toots?
shake it, they're in there.

## garth...?
yeah.

## you're the outfielder with the padres?
our goal is to raise $2 million, then the company can tour the west coast and include the new opera.

## i do think they overpaid for the picasso.
he says...

## i mean, for me it was unusually mediocre, don't you think?
i agree completely.

## are you affiliated with any of the museums?
no, i'm a private dealer.

## so what are you interested in?
er, rembrandt, picasso, michelangelo.

## but i have come into possession of an incredible damon dexter that someone's trying to sell, is he...?
i'm not aware of him.

## have you rinsed?
david used to own a vineyard, so he's a tough audience.

## this is excruciating.
in the closet?

## and can you believe them?
i can't keep a straight face.

## and the house?
not to mention her clothes.

## what's the matter, honey?
you've been quiet all night.

## what's bothering you?
what's bothering me is that we got no class.

## opera?
like food and wine and painting and books.

## stop it, will you?
i'm unimpressed.

## like what?
to change our lives.

## doing what?
playing pinball?.

## yeah, you said you were a teacher, you know art, opera, books, wine, you know, we want to learn it all, don't we, ray?
i'm flattered you think i'm capable of...

## turning two slugs like us into classy items?
no homework.

## what are...
have you ever thought about enrolling in college?

## i'm gonna learn about life suddenly?
i must say, frenchy, ray has a point, you know.

## what's he gonna teach you?
i can figure the point spread and count cards at blackjack.

## you could teach him that, right?
yeah.

## you said this is a slow period in the art market and we would take ver y good care of you, right?
like i say, i don't want to discourage you...

## you can see the difference between this tintoretto and the earlier byzantine painting we looked at.
spooked by the virgins!

## what would you say is the most significant difference?
i would say that the frame's bigger here.

## you remember how the saints had very flat faces and the background was on the same plane as the foreground?
perspective.

## take a hike, will ya?
28.

## who?
the band leader, stupid.

## oh.
married to betty grable?

## yeah?
this is where he lived and worked and...

## the heiress, right?
oh.

## did he write that too?
oh...

## 500?
see your five, raise you 500.

## what did you think of the book?
well, i thought it was very romantic.

## so you thought it was doomed from the start?
i guess, cos he wound up dead, but i think that two people from different backgrounds can make it if, er... the juice is there.

## sorry, juice is... is?
you know, the hots.

## wine, would you like some wine?
i brought over a bottle of chateau margaux.

## what about indian poker?
seven cards, hold them over your head, nobody sees their hand, we bet on each other's hands, high low, wild cards all the reds.

## can you play old maid?
so, um... try this one.

## me?
yeah.

## yeah, um, talking of which, how is your vocabulary coming along?
oh, good.

## they're serious about an art collection?
no, that would be peanuts.

## what, then?
well, i think that she might be falling for me.

## her husband, you mean?
no, it's all in her name.

## i don't know, i suppose i'm saying... people grow and marriages sadly break up and... women remarry, you know?
fortunes, they change hands.

## what is this?
it's a damon dexter, a discovery of david's.

## what does that mean?
it means i won't look at that wall.

## stevens, what time is it?
i no longer look at this wall.

## david, what's this?
oh...

## oh, that?
that's a citrine necklace.

## you know about citrines?
no.

## and that?
he did, he did, like our friend henry higgins.

## ray!
i'm... having chinese food.

## all right... but where's frenchy?
she's at a concert, some piano concert with a guy.

## do they taste like chicken?
rabbit.

## rabbit tastes like frog legs?
no...

## are you happy being rich?
it's ok.

## how come?
the guy i was seeing left me because he was so embarrassed about being poor and hated that i paid for everything.

## you... you enjoy being rich?
i hate it.

## no, i hate the life, you know?
it's making me lose frenchy.

## what?
i mean she's outgrowing me, that's what she said.

## what did you think of it?
i thought the whole evening was apocalyptic.

## apocalyptic?
totally.

## have you been memorising the dictionary?
yeah.

## how do i look?
i have to say, that dress is just... gorgeous.

## see?
your influence.

## low key, right?
well, that's very flattering...

## david?
paige.

## why?
because he loves his mother.

## more pepsi?
yeah, please.

## i don't know how to explain it exactly, but it's... it's right up there.
will you pass me the crackerjack?

## i i i was married.
what d'you mean?

## a long time ago, right?
it was a really tragic story because my husband, otto, was dyslexic, and the only thing he could spell was his name.

## what did you want to talk about?
i've, um...

## for me?
yeah.

## what?
i got you a present too.

## what good's having dough unless you spend it, huh?
this is... this is so extravagant...

## don't take up smoking, but if it's good enough for the duke of windsor, right?
well, i'm really overwhelmed and my little bernard shaw is so insignificant...

## can i be frank, david?
mm hm.

## what did you do?
ah, you know, i i, uh, worked late and then may and me had some chinese food.

## till 3am?
then we went and got a pizza.

## chinese food and a pizza?
i'm surprised you didn't break into the pepto bismol factory.

## i thought we might go along, see some sights.
now?

## what kind of sights?
churches, opera houses, ruins.

## fly 3, 000 miles to see opera houses and ruins?
well, i wanna go.

## what do you mean?
it's part of my development.

## what?
you're not my type either.

## what the hell does that mean?
maybe frenchy wasn't so wrong to try and make something out of herself.

## really?
wow, what a place.

## would it have been on tv?
i don't know, but it's been in magazines, it's famous.

## i can't hear you, what?
i...

## mrs winkler?
we're sorry to bring you back from your vacation.

## something happened to ray?
sunset enterprises is bankrupt.

## how?
fraud.

## who?
your accountants.

## what?
you should have looked.

## did you ever read anything you signed?
no, but they assured us everything was ok.

## mrs winkler, do you want a drink?
i'd like a 1961 romanee saint vivant if we have it.

## can't we do anything?
we could put a few people in jail if we could find them.

## that's right, yeah.
no?

## to do that you needed a bank loan, are you aware of that?
quite a substantial loan.

## could you put some cyanide in here?
it needs to be stronger.

## bankruptcy?
sorry.

## what difference does it make to ray?
he's gone.

## what did you say?
i'm bankrupt.

## how could that possibly happen?
fraud.

## what did you say?
it turns out i got people i owe.

## the time i've put in nurturing an idea that's not gonna happen.
h how could you be so stupid and irresponsible as to allow some patently cheap and thieving accountants to defraud you out of a future?

## the money?
i i need my prescription, my little blue pills so i'm gonna... go and get them.

## how are you?
good.

## me?
no, never.

## do either of you play miniature golf?
there's minky.

## shall i glide with you?
no, i'll contact you.

## can i get you some champagne?
uh... sure.

## thank you, ray.
have you seen edgar?

## golf?
no.

## would you like a canape?
those are shrimp, these are quail eggs, and...

## i'm george blint, mutual funds, and you?
may sloane, i'm a lookout.

## where's mr winkler?
i wanted to talk to him.

## cloudy today, wasn't it?
with a chance of light sprinkles followed by sunshine.

## chi chi, would you get those photos in the bedroom?
i want to show mr winkler the property in aspen.

## would you just...?
ray...

## did they see you come up here?
uh, i don't think so.

## are you ok?
i'm fine, i'm fine.

## so, you will try?
i'll do my best.

## mr winkler wouldn't go without saying goodbye, would he?
he's not upstairs.

## may, can you stop talking while i'm doing this?
little short fella, bright yellow shirt, unbelievable tie.

## are you sure?
er, yes, um...

## spells?
yes, she gets spells.

## why would i be bleeding?
oh, no, she...

## my medication?
i'll feel better if dr henske looks at her.

## where do you get this?
false alarm, it was a hot flash.

## spells?
not spells, but she...

## really?
they diagnosed parkinson's but it could be ebola or mad cow disease...

## ebola virus or mad cow?
i just said the first thing that came into my mouth.

## do i still remind you of your wife?
you kill me, you're great.

## you're not feeling well, remember?
i'm taking her home.

## didn't you hear?
sunset's gone under.

## what are you gonna do?
everybody makes mistakes.

## so where's david now?
he split the second i went bust.

## so now we got to begin again, you know?
and in more ways than one.

## you got to ask a question like that?
i'm crazy about you.

## may i show you one thing?
ok...

## how's it glass?
it's fake.

## how would you know?
i can tell fake, this ain't even good fake.

## what are you talking about?
oh, you know, it might fool some idiot with no eye and no brains but it'd never pass with a normal person.

## i came away with the wrong thing?
sounds like your mo.

## what?
you take those lessons...

## what can i do if you're wrong?
tell me.

## can i take your nose and twist it till you turn blue?
sure.

## i don't understand, who's the duke of windsor?
we could probably auction it.

## where'd you get this?
from david.

## david gave you this?
he doesn't know it yet.

## i don't get it, what do you mean?
hey, it was you who taught me how to open a safe.

## you boosted this from david's safe?
i'm looking for a box of chocolates.

## is it for a gift?
yeah.

## what about this one?
it's really nice.

## from belgium?
it's very pretty.

## who comes home every night?
look at those clothes.

## here, i got you some chocolates.
you think those kings and queens buy retail?

## you heard of chocolates?
i got you chocolates.

## how come?
these are from belgium.

## in 25 years of marriage, have i ever hit on anybody but you?
i don't buy it, ray.

## what did i tell you?
here comes the commercial.

## what?
i gotta have our six g's.

## that's all we got, right?
i got a brilliant idea.

## what?
first shot out of the box, you got it.

## what would you say if i told you... that you were married to a very brilliant man?
i'd say i'd have to be a bigamist.

## you like the way we're living?
it beats your former residence.

## think i like spending our anniversary staring at you through glass, talking over a phone?
frenchy, you stood by me.

## and what did i get for it?
you got belgian chocolates.

## what's wrong with that?
god, i've got an idea and this is so incredible.

## where are those bums gonna get that kind of stake?
they're not bums.

## harvard?
pass.

## oh, yeah?
if i lose it, you're gone.

## my share of what?
yeah, i got it.

## will you shut up?
fellas, i can't do it.

## because you get the kind of dreams people get... after putting opium in their brownies.
you gonna tell me, or are you gonna have a tantrum?

## can i for one minute tell you about this bank?
you're not a bank robber.

## can i please tell you my idea, frenchy?
i noticed a few weeks ago, a couple doors down from the bank, there's a pizza joint that folded.

## ray, we're poor but we're happy, ain't we?
we're not happy.

## is that the way you want to spend your life?
my mother told me.

## what's wrong with you?
we had dreams.

## did we not have dreams when i first met you?
yeah.

## you front the place.
what do you want me to do?

## what?
you front it.

## with what?
or you tell fortunes.

## see how beautiful this is?
yeah.

## see what you're seeing there?
it's not just new jersey.

## remember that?
yeah.

## what?
i believe a flower shop.

## to get to her and what?
beg her, con her, trick her.

## if her husband just died, what are you gonna say?
you need a plan.

## what are you gonna use for charm?
knock it off.

## why?
the only thing suspicious is your sanity.

## when did any of you guys dig a tunnel?
it's no big deal.

## who wants her?
uh, i got something for her.

## you took the lease on that empty store?
yeah.

## what do you think this is?
this is why i get the big dough.

## what did you do, tear a wall down?
we ain't started yet.

## what are you waiting for, the drilling season?
do me a favor.

## you got it?
okay, hold it.

## could we have a half dozen of the chocolate cinnamon?
i'd like a cookie for my daughter.

## sure, take a cookie.

## you think so?
yeah.

## you got a mirror?
i don't got a mirror.

## two?
okay, everybody, hold on.

## i figure it's gotta be two million, right?
then divided four ways, that's a half million bucks apiece.

## what about frenchy?
she's just a front.

## are you nuts?
then she'd be getting more than us.

## can't you add?
i don't do fractions.

## what is it?
the treasure of treasure island.

## it's gonna be like another two minutes, so that's the way the cookie crumbles, okay?
i got one cookie left.

## you know who's gonna eat this?

## a second person you wanna put on?
i can't help it, ray.

## what about my cousin may?

## issues?
yeah.

## what kind of problems?
last week the toilet on the fourth floor wouldn't flush.

## was it you who came up with the idea to advertise baked goods... in playboy, penthouse and hustler magazine?
i figured if a guy's staring at a naked piece of tail, and he sees the breasts and legs, he's gonna start to salivate.

## you understand?
it's psychology.

## pablo?
pablo, with the dogs.

## but physical therapy?
all the chocolate chips are put in the cookies by hand.

in the closet?

## you hear about the polish car pool?
every day they'd meet at work.

## can you believe the two of them?

## they plan on being very generous, and for that we must be thankful.
and what she's done with this apartment?

## and what about the harp?
not to mention the way she wears her clothes.

## what's the matter?
you've been quiet all night.

## what is bothering you?
what's bothering me is we got no class.

## opera?
like food and wine, and painting, and books.

## stop it, will ya?
i'm unimpressed.

## i'm gonna learn about life suddenly?
i must say, frenchy, ray has a point.

## what the hell is he gonna teach you?
i can figure the point spread.

## you could teach him that, right?
yeah.

## the virgins
spooked by the virgins.

## me?
i would say that the frame's bigger here.

## but there's also a difference in the paintings themselves, isn't there?
and it's an important difference because it characterizes... the great technical leap from the ancient into the modern world.

## you remember how those saints had very flat faces... and the background was on the same plane as the foreground?
perspective.

## can we get outta here?
you're always hungry.

## why don't you try and learn something?
there's nothing to learn.

## who?
the bandleader, stupid.

## married to betty grable?
i knew that.

## yeah?
i'm hungry.

## oh, did he write that too?
oh, gee.

## how are you?
hello.

## five hundred?
see your five, raise you 500.

## what'd you think of the book?
well, i thought it was very romantic.

## you thought he was doomed from the start?
but, uh, i think that two people from different backgrounds can make it... if, uh, the juice is there.

## would you like some wine?
i brought over a bottle of chateau margaux.

## what about indian poker?
seven cards.

## do you play old maid?
so, um... try this one.

## me?
yeah.

## um, talking of which, how is your vocabulary coming along?
oh, very good.

## how serious are they about building an art collection?
that would be peanuts.

## what, then?
well, i think that she might be falling for me.

## how much do you think she's worth, roughly?
her husband you mean.

## what are you saying?
i don't know.

## and women remarry, you know?
fortunes, they change hands.

## what is this?
it's a damon dexter, a discovery of david's.

## what is that supposed to mean?
it means as long as this is on that wall, i don't look at that wall.

## hey, whose cookies pay the rent, huh?
i think he's making a fool outta you.

## david, what's this?
oh, well, that's a citrine necklace.

## you know about citrines?
no.

## you can't tell me about it?
non.

## well, i'll take it, allright?
of course, it's illegal to discriminate.

## you're sure you wanna do this?
you know you're gonna lose.

## dreaming of space?
come here.

## what do you mean?
you might get ideas.

## how did you hear about me?
people.

## tattoos, scars, birth marks?
no.

## are you serious about this?
i hope you're not wasting my time.

## you have somebody in mind?
for the genetically superior, success is easier to attain, but is by no means not guaranteed.

## but how do i explain the accident?
that's the beautiful thing, it happened out of the country.

## who lives up there?
well, i certainly don't.

## isn't there any other way?
surgery is no good, they'll see the scars.

## why, why?
there's still the matter of the height.

## why, how tall are you?
4 foot 6.

## how tall were you before the accident?
so, i can wear lifts.

## so what?
no...

## are you all right?
yeah.

## do you want to go dancing?
you had to be a right hander.

## what makes you think you can be me at all?
look at this.

## are you colour blind, too, vincent?
i don't know, exactly.

## do you really want to be in there?
i don't wanna be in there, i wanna be up there.

## what's up there?
that's want i want to find out, jerome.

## where's my sample?
in the refrigerator.

## which pouch?
oh, any of them.

## you think i should test it?
if you like.

## my god, what's wrong with the machine?
it's nothing wrong with the machine.

## well?
congratulations.

## what about the interview?
that was it.

## excuse me, sir?
nothing.

## will you seek to that i don't lose my place in line?
your place is assured.

## director?
thank you, irene.

## director, how will this affect the mission?
oh, we're still going ahead as planned.

## what happened?
i'm going up.

## when?
end of the week.

## what about the mission director?
he's dead.

## are you serious?
they found him in his office this morning, beaten so badly they had to check his name tag.

## so?
i didn't do it.

## besides, what if they do find something?
i'm gonna be slightly out of their jurisdiction.

## you've opened the wine, i hope?
of course, sir.

## the specimen?
i kissed him five minutes ago.

## you want the full sequence?
yes.

## what are you gonna do?
i have my books.

## seriously, what are you going to do?
i'm going to finish this.

## what's titan like?
titan is exactly like this.

## why is that?
i'm scared of heights.

## i'll save some for you, shall l?
i'm so sorry.

## what car?
i stepped right out in front of it.

## i couldn't even get that right, could i?
if at first you don't succeed, try, try again.

## how much do you need?
20 minutes.

## the eyelash, what do you know about it?
it's an unregistered in valid.

## is a janitor gonna come back here after all this time to kill a man he never knew?
well, his profile does suggest a violent temperament.

## who is he?
we found an unaccounted for specimen in the south wing.

## who do you have to be, to be here?
naturally, our standard is beyond that of the common citizen.

## and exceeding it?
no one exceeds his potential.

## if he did?
it would mean we did not accurately gauge his potential in the first place.

## are you all right, jerome?
terrific.

## do you have an alibi?
i was alone.

## didn't he threaten to cancel your mission more than once?
somebody did you a favour.

## do they have any idea whose hand i should be shaking?
they found an eyelash in the s wing.

## does it have a name?
just some in valid.

## what about you, irene?
you're engineered just like the rest of us.

## is this the approach path we discussed?
absolutely, director.

## they think i killed the mission director.
why don't you try a change?

## what makes them think that?
they found my eyelash.

## where?
in the corridor.

## i've put too much into this.
what are you doing?

## wheel in there and finish the job myself?
eugene, they are going to find me.

## you still don't understand, do you?
when they look at you, they don't see you any more.

## how could you be so careless?
i'm going out.

## where are you going?
well if i'm gonna get arrested tomorrow, i'm gonna go out tonight.

## are you sure that's a good idea to go out?
that was your idea not to change anything.

## who's going?
i'd say everybody.

## you don't want to look suspicious, do you?
thanks.

## what are we doing here?
i'm following a lead.

## why makes you think the owner of the eyelash is here?
he's an in valid, sir.

## what do you suggest, sir?
move the inquiry back to the scene.

## that's what it says, doesn't it?
it doesn't say you're crippled.

## i said forget it.
how dare you question me?

## an apology?
it gets to you, doesn't it.

## what's your number?
may i remind you that this is a crime scene.

## what are you doing, old man?
doing my job, sir.

## you didn't know?
oh yes, yeah.

## wonderful, wasn't it?
12 fingers or 1, it's how you play.

## what's all this about?
it's probably nothing.

## get my meaning?
thanks.

## what did i tell you?
strange.

## the cup was definitely used since the original sweep?
that's far fetched, but is not out of a possibility.

## what's with the plungers, lamar?
only the gentlemen from the law enforcement are concerned that my testing methods have been compromised.

## are you out of practice, lamar?
let me look at that.

## so you didn't do it after all?
i guess someone beat me to it.

## test?
i cannot allow you to disrupt our operations any further.

## you're not at all concerned about having amurderer in your midst?
now, your presence is creating more of a threat.

## mission means a great deal to you, doesn't it?
your late colleague opposed it.

## did you get yours broken once?
i had this crazy idea that you were more interested in the murder case than me.

## would you like to dance?
check the hands, lenses, dentures, napkins, i want cigarette butts, the saliva off tea cups.

## where are you going?
i...

## the scars on your legs?
this is the exact height of the front fender.

## did you just make that up or do you use all the time?
i use it all the time.

## isn't that the man from last night?
he's nobody.

## can i help you?
i'm looking for jerome morrow.

## hello?
eugene, i need you to be yourself for the day.

## i was never very good at it, remember?
the investigators are coming by.

## how long have i got?
not long.

## where's my kiss?
good to see you're feeling better.

## how can i help?
it's about the director.

## again?
i hope it's no trouble.

## can't we do this another time?
this won't take a moment.

## yes?
we have our man, sir.

## you have him?
we have him in custody.

## how are you, jerome?
not bad, jerome.

## how the hell did you get up here?
i can always walk.

## you're a god child?
they've got you looking so hard for any flaw, that after a while that's all that you see.

## so the in valid had nothing to do with this?
no, our friend here acted alone.

## this mission meant everything to him, didn't it?
he knows that if they miss this launch window he wouldn't live to see the next one.

## so, i imagin you'll be celebrating tonight, sir?
of course.

## who, the cop?
yeah.

## did you catch his name?
actually my name was the topic of conversation.

## vincent?
my god, you have changed.

## are we brothers?
our parents both died thinking they'd outlived ya.

## what are you doing here, anton?
i should ask you that question.

## do you have any idea what it took to get in here?
you've gone as far as you can go.

## is that the only way you can succeed, is to see me fail?
in case you haven't noticed, i don't need any rescuing.

## you've got all the answers, how do you explain that?
you didn't beat me that day.

## do you want me to prove it to you?
it's not important, anton.

## do you wanna quit?
we have to go back.

## you want to know how i did it?
this is how i did it, anton.

## you couldn't see, could you?
that night, crossing the street.

## you're flying today, aren't you?
look at what a mess you're in.

## why have you done all this?
so jerome will always be here when you need him.

## where are you going?
i'm travelling, too.

## what is this?
new policy.

## flight got you nervous?
there's a problem, lamar.

## i never did tell you about my son, did i?
he's a big fan of yours.

## right?
for future reference, right handed men don't hold it with their left.

## it's next to godliness, isn't that what they say?
godliness...

## has the committee approved the mission?
there's been talk of delay.

## have i ever told you that?
only every time i'm in here.

## by the way, have i ever told you about my son?
no, you haven't.

## a dozen?
sometimes more.

## the name for the certificate?
anton.

## have you given it any thought?
we would want vincent to have a brother, you know, to play with.

## 750 million, 800 million, 850 million.
see how much he's grown?

## how many astronauts are there anyway?
i bet i could be one if i wanted.

## well, i'll take it, allright?
of course, it's illegal to discriminate.

## so are you happy, mum?
yes... for you.

## jacinto, do you think i might have a word with boaventura now?
i believe in the free market, that s where i made my fortune.

## l ve just received confirmation of the loan to purchase the banco popular.
are you sure that boaventura will buy the bank?

## on our terms?
on our terms.

## may i ask him inside?
congratulations, mr. boaventura.

## i have your word then, mr. boaventura?
yes.

## what do you want to know?
the bank of portugal s position in this story.

## pedro?
he s the one in the limelight in the boaventura deal.

## ls your party for or against?
off the record.

## how about a group photo?
jacinto.

## we always have to be the strongest dont we?
we know no limits, we admit no defeats.

## will you be needing anything else?
no thank you, mr. silva.

## ready?
my government is in favour of the existence of strong economic groups in portugal.

## you don t think that you could be placing your political career at risk?
there are still men of honour in portugal and l m certain that mr. boaventura is one of them.

## what?
nothing...

## hi, pedro?
everything went very well.

## why did you leave the university in order to return to portugal?
because my father s good name is more important to me than my career.

## but as a true professional, you also like a good challenge?
that this is a pyramid and a paper knife... in crystal...

## don t take me for an idiot... what does this mean in your secret code?
you ve got more experience than me in esoteric interpretations.

## do our banks have credits on the resende brokerage house?
l ve left a full report on your desk.

## might i ask the reason for your interest?
my father s brokerage house is in dire straits.

## dr. jacinto?
the minister will see you now.

## of course...
what government?

## it appears that your name is being mentioned to occupy a place in the government?
they re just rumours, mr. boaventura.

## dom jos, how are you?
as has been stated quite clearly in this commission, the government had always acted in the national interest...

## dr. jacinto?
lsabel, please ask dr. teles and dr. alvaro to come to my office.

## the only way to climb the pyramid of power is with a dagger.... is that why you came to see me?
no.

## l d be delighted.
rosa, could you come in here please?

## which one, francisco?
you know perfectly well which one.

## do you realise what you re suggesting?
yes.

## or don t you trust yourself, when i come too close for comfort?
i prefer to maintain a strict separation between business and pleasure.

## a crepe suzette for madame?
exactly.

## you don t mind?
don t stand on ceremony with me... in any way...

## that would be nice, wouldn t it?
you re capable of anything, but don t risk a thing.

## are you sure this is what you want?
absolutely.

## and you won t regret it?
no.

## life is full of surprises, isn t it?
when we least expect it, something happens and everything s turned on its head.

## remember those letters you once wrote to my father?
you were working in the bank of portugal and transmitted him confidential information on big decisions in the pipeline...

## good evening, mr. boaventura?...
what do you want then?

## how are you?
of course i can.

## dr. jacinto, didn t you learn in school that all pacts obtained through violence are null and void?
you pledged to keep the group under national control...

## what nation?
the nation crumbled after the revolution, and respectable citizens were left unprotected.

## you re afraid to go your own way.
where have you been?

## what do you know about my life?
yes.

## what do you think?
l ll have a word, but he doesn t like to set foot here.

## l ve got another excellent proposal to make to you...
dr. fernando... we re her on business, right?

## oh yes?
mr. boaventura, needs an intelligent person such as maria helena... to oversee his public image and that of his group...

## commemorate?
of course l ll go with you.

## where?
take.. it.. off.. take.. it.. off...

## you sure he can be trusted?
don t worry... he s a college student.

## dr. rosa?
mr. boaventura would like to count upon your influence over dr. jacinto...

## could you come to my office please?
whenever i see you, you never fail to take my breath away.

## rosa bought shares in the banco popular?
so...

## what s the big hurry?
read this confidential document that joaquim castro received from spain.

## l m dying to hear the reason for such an urgent visit...
you think you can defeat these guys on your own?

## you ve come to talk about your boys?
rosa pereira lopes is not the best way to reach jacinto, mr. boaventura... you should have spoken with me first...

## at the estate?
i look forward to it...

## i don t know if you re ready for the proposal that l m about to make, and i also don t require an immediate reply...
mine?

## you want to buy our brokerage house?
no...

## lf you had to choose between being loyal to a friend and to an employer, what would you choose, mum?
i don t think that even father francisco could summarise my situation so succinctly.

## who gave you this?
draw up the contract between boaventura and the santamaria group so as to ensure that our position is unassailable.

## true freedom?
not letting others prevent us doing what we want.

## which do you prefer?
depends who it s for...

## you plan to marry?
i do.

## don t you want to know the bride s name?
dr. ftima resende.

## yes?
open up.

## are you really going to marry boaventura?
yes...

## you never thought of being happy, just happy?
our happiness resides in being in the centre of big battles.

## what do you expect me to do?
you know better than i do...

## minister, is it true that you ve already handed in your resignation?
minister, where are these agreements?...

## some highwayman?
l ll set the picture straight...

## and wasn t he the one who took part in all the negotiations with the government?
dr. ftima is right:it s important that he assumes boaventura s position in public.

## and what if i, and the rest of the board, don t hold this opinion?
worse for us all... especially for you...

## and if i manage to persuade the board to decide in favour of boaventura plc, what do i get out of it, in addition to the photographs?
mr. boaventura s eternal gratitude... which may materialise in many mysterious and wondrous manners.

## dr....?
dr. jacinto...

## ls it true that you ll be joining the government?
the rdio clube portugus has ascertained that dr. jacinto pereira lopes will be invited for the post of minister of finances.

## what do you think i should do:support boaventura or the government?
let the dust settle and you ll soon recognise who holds the reigns of power.

## dr. ftima boaventura has been nominated chairman of the board.
how did you feel when you learned of this morning s tragedy?

## bruce willis is dead.
what s your reaction to this nomination?

## what?
bruce willis, he's a ghost.

## why would you tell me that?
i don't know.

## you seen it?
no.

## what?
she breaks her neck and she dies.

## who's russ thompson?
he's the democrat running for manhattan borough president whose campaign i've been working on.

## you guys have to come support russ thompson, all right?
we cannot let him lose to that republican douche bag jack clark.

## what are you talking about?
whenever my boss starts dating a new girl, he likes me to show up at the restaurant and pretend to recognize him.

## but, i mean, why are you still working for that lunatic?
because that lunatic is my ticket to rock immortality.

## yeah, but what do you expect?
it was the bachman turner overdrive without bachman or turner.

## bobby, you're coming, right?
no, because i'm not a democrat.

## what are you?
i'm an unregistered.

## what is it?
it's a personal thing.

## personal thing.
what?

## is she hairy?
i don't have a date with a hairy girl.

## because she's... hairless?
you guys, it's a personal thing.

## so what'd you think of thompson?
i thought he had some really good ideas.

## like, those chunks of melon wrapped in ham?
yeah, that's why i'm voting for him.

## hairy or hairless?
actually, neither.

## so what?
so there.

## are they sharing a dessert?
creme brulee.

## in eighth grade, when we all went to see jurassic park, who snuck in to sleepless in seattle?
he used to design clothes for his g. i. joes.

## what do we do now?
i think we have to tell him that we know.

## i mean, why make him go on living a lie?
i agree.

## what stories?
and i used to get the prickly heat on my legs.

## and i always wore that shorty robe?
yeah, your kimono.

## bloop.
all i got on is the shorty robe and the baby oil, you know?

## bloop?
bloop.

## so, uh, for how how long?
oh, just, like, a second.

## you guys don't have any stories, do you?
it's 11:00.

## where is he?
maybe mr. creme brulee invited him in for a casual gay encounter.

## i mean, there's no foreplay, right?
not that i know.

## can i get you a glass of chardonnay?
then we can dish.

## uh, so... how was your evening?
it was fine.

## okay, what is going on with you guys?
all right, all right.

## were you following me?
no, no.

## it's cool, okay?
you just let it out.

## all right?
just let that right out.

## that's your secret?
yep.

## what?
i'm not gay.

## why would you think that?
well, you spend more on shampoo than i do on food.

## since when?
i suspected back in middle school.

## don't you think you're blowing this a little out of proportion?
it's just politics.

## like what?
and this is why i don't vote.

## that if i'm a republican, we can't be friends?
i don't know.

## after everything we've been through together, you're gonna let this one little thing get between us?
it's not a little thing to me.

## so you still mad at jason?
i'm not mad at jason.

## what are you doing?
sending out campaign materials for russ thompson.

## may i sit?
free country.

## stuffing envelopes?
yes.

## you too?
yeah.

## are you?
look, if he had his way, the rich wouldn't pay taxes and alaska would become one giant gas station.

## who's that?
it's a friend of mine.

## bobby, what are you doing here?
we got a real problem at home.

## is your friend here to ask my advice?
yes, nick.

## so... flatmates having a bit of a row?
they are.

## just humor us, okay?
all right, let's get this over with.

## see?
let's all take a seat.

## so you just pop your finger right up in there?
yep.

## we don't see a ring on this finger, huh?
just hit the road, jackass.

## real quick, what's your secret?
well, we get along really well.

## what do you guys think?
i don't know.

## so, you wanna go splatter some zombie brains, you fascist?
i could do that.

## sheldon dratch just happened to show up here?
not really.

## what's going on?
oh, man.

## well?
he's here.

## who's here?
he came out of the closet.

## what are you talking about?
him.

## okay?
he's not real.

## well, let's have a look around, then, shall we?
no.

## you still on for this weekend?
no, thought i'd wrangle up a dinner invitation...... from one of those art department girls.

## meeting the folks?

## by throwing you in a lake?
you know, this might be a good time for a toast.

## yeah?
yeah.

## not getting weird on me again, are you?
no, no.

## is it gonna make it?
i got a guy looking at it.

## so you want a ride home?
no, i'm good.

## where is he?
tim, it's uncle mike.

## were the directions okay?
perfect.

## shouldn't we wait for the bellhop or something?
shut up.

## what's with the tie?
i figured, meeting the family.

## why not, right?
i'm an associate editor.

## any brothers, sisters?
no, sir.

## how about your folks?
let the boy eat.

## well, what about your mother?
she sort of had a tough time after my dad left.

## is there anything else you wanted to know, dad?
be down in a minute, mom.

## you have fun down there?
oh, come on.

## you see my sister's face when i said...... you lived in a tiny room in the back of a bar?
it wasn't in the back of a bar, you know.

## is that why you wanted me here, to freak out your family?
no.

## hey, i'm sorry, okay?

## i should've done more, but it's something, right?

## tim, you've been coming here for what, 15 years?

## you know how thick that rubber is?
the driver can't change a flat on a bus.

## so, do you see any mechanics around here?

sticks.

## you want to wait around... so you can poke at that thing with sticks?

## and that doesn't mean that it is.
with that thing out there?

## hey, this isn't about who can run the fastest, ok?
or being a pussy.

## do i make you nervous?

## you want to play cock of the walk now, huh?
now's not the time for this shit, scotty.

## you want to call me something else, scotty?
i can see you thinking it whether you say it or not.

## now that something really serious happens... you can't even be civil to each other?

## can you just please tell me that you're on the way?
i can't really judge the strength of your signal... but it doesn't sound close.

## what does that mean, man?
