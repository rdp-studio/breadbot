let's go.

## we gonna talk about this?
i cannot believe you had the nerve to bring that in this office.

## why don't you just give it to the judge?
cause they'd throw the case out.

no, it's not for real.

## you got any other suggestions?
well, look at it.

you've got your own duplex.

## what?
i have a message for your wife.

## and how are the dear saxons taking the news, sir guy?
they're even more worried than longchamps, your highness.

## whoever would have thought my dear brother would be so considerate as to get captured...... and leave all of england to my tender care?
he may disapprove when he returns, your highness.

## that's all you saxons think about.
but who's gonna pay me?

## the rest remain here.
didn't i tell you it was for prince john, who's just come up from london?

## what's your name, you saxon dog?
a better one than yours.

## what's your name?
much, the miller's son.

## you know it's death to kill the king's deer?
come now, sir guy.

## you'd not kill a man for telling the truth?
lf it amused me, yes.

## by what right do you interfere with justice?
by a better right than you have to misuse it.

## eh, will?
yes, he has been getting rather out of hand.

## what's his fault?
he's killed a royal deer.

## are there no exceptions?
thanks, good master.

## was it worthwhile coming with me from london...... to see what stout fellows our nottingham friends are?
take sir guy of gisbourne, now.

## why, you like him, don't you?
well, he's a norman, of course.

## lsn't that reason enough for a royal ward who must obey her guardian?
oh, nay, i'd not force you, my lady.

## with a saxon dangling from every gallows tree between here and charnwood?
well said, sir knight.

## who is that?
sir robin of locksley.

## sir rob sir robin of locksley?
why, i've heard precious little else since i've been here.

## what's his latest outrage?
oh, nothing less than killing a royal deer in sherwood forest today.

## and you didn't take him?
that would have been a problem, your highness.

## a saxon a problem?
he's a notorious troublemaker, my lady.

## but what?
well, he's the deadliest archer in england, and....

## who is this, this...?
sir robin of locksley, your highness.

## run out of hangings?
i know a ripe subject for one.

## i hope my lady had a pleasant journey from london?
what you hope can hardly be important.

## you hear that, gentlemen?
here's gisbourne so in love with marian he daren't say\"boo\"to her...... and this saucy fellow gives her better than she sends.

## have you had meat?
none but what i brought.

## bring sir robin food at once, do you hear?
such impudence must support a mighty appetite.

## so you think you're overtaxed, eh?
overtaxed, overworked and paid off with a knife, a club or a rope.

## oh, you're not?
as you may know, my brother is a prisoner of leopold of austria.

## why to you, your highness?
king richard appointed longchamps regent.

## you, sir mortimer of leeds?
not i, your highness.

## you, sir boron?
nor i, your highness.

## you, sir ralf of durham?
my sword is yours, your highness.

## have you no stomach for honest meat?
for honest meat, yes.

## you?
yes.

## what do you call a man who takes advantage of a king's misfortune...... to seize his power?
and now, with the help of this sweet band of cutthroats...... you'il try to grind a ransom for him out of every helpless saxon.

## and what do you propose to do?
i'il organize revolt.

## have you finished?
there, through the gate.

## ... the sooner you begin collecting the  the ransom, your highness?
yes, yes, of course.

## after a refreshing sleep in the greenwood?
i've pulled seven acorns out of my ribs.

## hooting?
he was singing you to sleep.

## i'il get myself a staff.
aren't you man enough?

## ready?
yes.

## who?
this quarterstaff master.

## what's your name, friend?
john little.

## what's yours?
robin.

## not robin of locksley?
aye.

## he'il die if we lash him again, my lord.
are you with me?

## oh, he'il die, will he?
yes, but i couldn't find him.

## what chance has anyone of finding him?
every villager and woodcutter's his friend.

## do you question my valor?
i only hope this murderer does come out of his hiding place.

## well?
i live in the forest with good fellows who've everything in life save spiritual guidance.

## and what's that?
we're outlaws.

## come now, fat one.
on my back?

## why don't you give up?
you can see i'm a better swordsman.

## must we go on, then?
i think we're even now, friar.

## even?
nay.

## you'il join us?
aye.

## robin.
you're robin hood, aren't you?

## aye?
i've got word  it's all right.

## one of us?
he looks like three of us.

## what's it, will?
sir guy of gisbourne is stopping by the way tonight.

## when does he enter sherwood?
tomorrow.

## are you ready, men?
aye.

## see anything of them?
not yet.

## ls everything ready?
they'il think they've got into a blooming hornet's nest.

## afraid?
certainly not, sir.

## oh, yes, he jumps out of ambush at small parties, but he wouldn't dare to attack us.
are you sure?

## well, you old rooster, what do you see?
make ready.

## do you see sir guy?
he's leading the second.

## what, sir guy, no greeting from you?
why, that's curious.

## fighting?
i'm afraid he has no choice, my lady.

## have we, men?
we only want to stroke his pretty neck.

## you see?
well, let's away.

## or ladies?
she means you.

## a hedge robber?
i ain't never been out walking...

## what female?
you.

## do you mean to say you never had one single sweetheart in all your life?
you don't know what you missed, my lad.

## aren't you even a little pleased to see them enjoying themselves?
i think it's revolting.

## your life's been very sheltered, hasn't it, my lady?
i'm afraid the company has spoiled my appetite.

## a little mutton, my lady?
i said i'm not hungry.

## he provides us with this tasty supper.
well, you will let me know if you regain your appetite, won't you?

## yes.
and is this the end of his beneficence?

## i suppose you and your cutthroats intend to send this treasure to richard?
i may have been hasty....

## or of me, perhaps?
i'm afraid of nothing.

## have you eaten well, friend?
yes, thank you, robin hood.

## because i can feel for beaten, helpless people?
no, you're strange because you want to do something about it.

## what's that matter?
it's injustice i hate, not the normans.

## you just don't understand, do you?
i'm sorry.

## yes, master?
take six men and guide our loyal host and his nervous friend to the nottingham road.

## with your permission, my lady?
goodbye, my lady.

## he took everything you had collected?
every silver penny.

## what did your highness expect?
with the lady marian in our company and locksley's men outnumbering us.

## lf i may be so bold as to inquire?
mind your words, gisbourne.

## but what?
that's marvelous.

## think he'd forgo shooting...... against the archers of all england?
we'il give a prize.

## and ask him to risk his neck for that?
that won't be the only bait, with the lady marian presenting the arrow herself.

## what do you mean?
when they came out of the forest, she seemed very friendly.

## and didn't you notice how his eyes never left her?
the man who wins the golden arrow will be robin hood.

## will you take that bonnet off?
i hope our little golden hook will catch the fish.

## you hope?
oh, it will if he's here.

## are your men sure of their orders?
yes.

## well, what of it?
you know what'il happen if they do.

## where's your sporting blood?
sir guy accepted our invitation.

## where's your love of fights, risk, adventure?
well, since our friend seems to have gone a little mad, i'il have to see him through.

## lady marian?
oh, i'm sorry.

## and if i had, what interest could a tinker have for me?
phillip of arras shoots next.

## what is your name, archer?
godfrey of sherwood, your highness.

## how is it that a tinker learned so well the use of arms?
even a peaceful tinker must protect himself these days from treachery and other things.

## how is it that you didn't use a black arrow?
that's my court of last resort, sir guy.

## haven't you forgotten a count or two?
surely it's a crime under the noble prince john to love one's country.

## ls it the outlaw?
yes.

## why, my lady, how should i know?
don't put me off.

## you've been seeing him?
yes, my lady.

## do you want to send a message?
to his men, yes.

## oh, dear....
where was it?

## but there must be some way  lf we had to, couldn't we storm the place?
why, you'd need an army with a battering ram to even dent it.

## what is it, prin?
a lady, sir.

## what?
it's a trap, will.

## ls she alone?
yes, sir.

## what do you want, my lady?
i want to help him.

## how did you find us here?
never mind that now.

## what's to prevent your killing me if? ls there no one here with sense enough to see?
one moment.

## you swear by our lady that you want to help robin?
i swear, good father.

## have you thought of a way?
yes.

## can you get us in the castle?
that's no good.

## yes, isn't it?
with locksley out of the way, we'il stamp out the rest.

## won't it be a pleasant surprise for prince john when he returns?
here i am.

## tell me, when you are in love, is it...... well, is it hard to think of anybody but one person?
yes, indeed, and sometimes there's a bit of trouble sleeping.

## does it make you want to be with him all the time?
yes.

## tell me, my lady, when he looks at you, do you feel a kind of prickly feeling...... like goosy pimples running all up and down your spine?
then there's not a doubt of it.

## keep quiet, bess.
doubt of what?

## why did you come here?
to see you.

## but don't you realize that?
of course, i probably wouldn't be as good at it as this pretty young girl.

## now, let's see, where does this game begin?
oh, i know.

## you are, aren't you?
please.

## don't you?
you know i do.

## i'il go.
do you know you're very impudent?

## to sherwood?
i've nothing to offer you but a life of hardship and danger, but we'd be together.

## will you?
because i love you, robin, i'd come.

## then you will?
no.

## you remember that day in sherwood forest?
i realized then for the first time that what you were doing was right...... and that we were wrong.

## now do you see why you have to go back to your men alone?
go now, quickly, dearest.

## you gentlemen have traveled far?
yes, quite a distance.

## how is that?
the bishop of the black canons.

## do you wish to go on after dinner?
no.

## they burst on us from ambush.
what happened, your grace?

## who did?
why, robin hood, of course.

## you've heard of him, then?
oh, he seems well known hereabouts.

## oh, then you're strange to this shire?
more or less.

## what might be your names, gentlemen?
they're hardly important enough to deserve your interest.

## landlord, where's our ale?
coming, sirs.

## will you gentlemen be remaining here tonight?
we hadn't decided, your grace.

## what would you advise?
let's to sleep, then.

## did you see the fear on the landlord's face when he came in?
i've seen it in the faces of thousands since we returned.

## and you're sure it was richard?
go on, gisbourne.

## who's to...?
dickon was a knight before your brother hacked off his spurs...... over some little mischance.

## you know this tavern?
yes.

## am i not right?
with the manor and estate of robin of locksley to support his rank.

## when shall i start?
lmmediately.

## how many men will you need?
you're a clever fellow, gisbourne.

## do you suppose she heard?
i don't know.

## why should i be?
oh, come now, my dear lady marian.

## how did locksley and his men arrange his escape...... from hanging after the archery match?
someone here in the castle must have got word to him.

## are you not ashamed, my lady marian?
yes, i am.

## sorry?
i'd do it again if you kill me for it.

## have you got it all in your stupid head now?
of course i have.

## robin will look after her, all right.
bess, where was dickon supposed to find king richard?

## where's dickon heading for?
kent road tavern.

## kent road tavern?
you can save three miles and cut him off through low wood.

## oh, you will be careful, won't you?
too far to be patient with delay now.

## you see, sir abbot?
we're poor outlaws, with nothing to eat but the king's deer...... while you have property, rents, and silver.

## are you friendly to our good king richard?
i love no man better.

## then i can go free?
any friend of richard's is free of this forest.

## would you honor us by sharing meat with us?
gladly.

## well, sir rascal, tell me, who are you?
those i kill died from misusing the trust that richard left them.

## you'd condemn holy crusades?
prince john sent dickon to kent road tavern last night to kill the king.

## where is he?
i don't know, master.

## understand?
you don't need to search for richard, robin.

## sire, prince john's calling bishop of the black canons...... to proclaim him king in nottingham tomorrow.
what do you mean?

## how'd you learn this?
without an army it'il be much too strong.

## your sword, gisbourne.
ls it of your own free will that you thus depose your brother...... richard the lion heart of england?

## what about you, robin?
my sword is yours, sire, now and always.

## ls there nothing the king can grant the outlaw...... who showed him his duty to his country?
there's but one thing else, sire.

## and do you too wish...?
more than anything in the world, sire.

## percy?
not right now.

## what kind of question is that, \"you got a woman in here?
i didn't know.

## now she wants us to renew our vows.
vows?

## i did, didn't i?
yes, you did.

## you know what?
i think it's cool you're just doing the lyrics from that song.

## you wrote that on the way to work?
yeah.

## were you listening to the radio when you wrote it?
cause i think it's b2k.

## see your sexy smile and bump, bump?

## did i hear theresa's bringing a new boyfriend to your anniversary party?
yes.

## what?
i'm fine with it.

## so, you met him?
nope.

## theresa?
i don't believe it.

## this guy didn't seem to care, did he?

## what have we got?

## baby?

## it's a good thing i do then, huh?
theresa, a man is never excited about meeting his future father in law.

## what?
it was your idea.

## at that wedding, was a woman involved?
of course it involved a woman.

## so, percy, which one do you like best?
i like that...

## which one costs the most?
they cost the same.

## really?
well, that's too bad, 'cause i'm wearing this one.

## yeah?
listen.

## why do you even bother asking me?
cause it's a big day for us and i wanted you to feel included.

## why couldn't you include martha superfreak out there?
dante is a nice man.

## would you open your mind, percy jones?
dante is a metrosexual.

## a what?
he's a straight man with taste.

## this boy that theresa's bringing home?
i don't know who his people are, where he's from...

## you pulled his credit report?

## simon?
that's her boyfriend's name.

## well, who are you?
wesley thompson.

## why don't you just go?
just...

## why don't we go on inside and talk?
we taught our girls to see only people, not color.

## you want to sit down?

## what was i supposed to do?
he was staring at me with those piercing eyes.

## how did you know where to find me?
lewis said you lived in brooklyn.

## yeah, huh?
and odds were i'd still be stuck in brooklyn, which obviously i am.

## is he in town here?
sheriff, the day you and tony left penang, a man came looking for a bike you guys had rented.

## and lewis caught hell for that, huh?
yeah.

## is he still in prison now?
for eight more days, yeah.

## at least he's getting out in eight days though, huh?
that's not the case.

## what happens to us?
the deal was that if both of you go back, it's three years apiece, and if only one of you goes back, it's six.

## jesus christ, for a shitty brick of hash?
so in eight days from now...

## what are you, his lawyer?
i'm his american lawyer, yeah.

i can't.

## don't you sleep?
i want to do this more.

## breakfast?
can't.

## lunch?
i pulled a day shift.

## say 7:00?
tomorrow at 7:00.

## how come it took you guys two years to tell me this?
lewis never mentioned the two of you.

## you gotta understand, this isn'tjust about me, all right?
like anybody, i have a lot of responsibilities.

## could you call me there tonight?
all right.

## miss eastern?
hi.

## surprised i showed?
no.

cos i am.

## eastern party?

mm hm.

## yeah?
tony said he was going to call me when he got back from penang.

## i can't count on tony's word?
no, i'm not saying that.

## how come?
because i'm...

## how does $50, 000 sound? $50, 000?
that sounds fine.

## you want me to pay you $150, 000 for assuming what is, in fact, your share of the responsibility?
no, not you.

## i mean, they got the heavy money, right?
you come to new york on what was pretty much a fishing expedition.

## really funny?
people like you think you can just buy people like me.

## menus?
i'm sorry.

## how're you doin ', tony?
yep.

## so this is the office, huh?
let's just sort this out without that lawyer breathing down our necks.

## she's pretty intense, huh?
no shit, man.

## you're going back?
no.

## you think i don't care about lewis?
that's what you're acting like.

## then how come you're so ready to slam the door on him?
i know something about guys who have clubs and badges.

## you think of that?
this is the other side of the coin.

## if this goes down, god forbid, and lewis hangs, you don't think this is gonna be headline news?
sheriff, this is gonna follow you around the rest of your life.

## whereas the other way we come home heroes and the city throws us a parade?
tony, you're a fucking boy scout.

## listen to me, ok?
lewis would have gone back for either of us.

## beth eastern?
hi.

## you're a what?
a reporter.

## and what would you want with me?
come on, beth.

## really?
in this instance, your interests and the interests of the public converge.

## how did you find out about this?
my sources at the state department.

## the american kid who graffitied a car?
because of the media frenzy, they had to cane the kid.

## you know what happened?

## jesus christ, you don't let up, do you?
i can't.

## you know what?

## are you inviting me to dinner, or are we still mad at each other?
both.

## did he?
he did.

## that's it?
yeah.

## have you spent a lot of time with him?
i've never had a beer with him.

## oh, sheriff, what do you think about me?
i don't know.

## would you go back?
i wouldn't ask you or tony to do this if i hadn't already answered the question for myself.

## i'm not a piece of dirt you get off on then flush down the john, all right?
he'il fuck you and then sneak out, by the fire escape if he has to.

## what?
fuck you for not wearing a ring.

## ok?
yeah.

## long time, huh?
i guess if you're seeing this tape you've kind of figured that my vacation plans... changed.

## kind of ironic, isn't it?
look who's caged and... they say soon to be extinct.

## pop, remember that trip i took a couple of years back, to malaysia?
yeah, i remember.

## some sleaze was selling frequent flyer miles, right?
that's not the point.

## did you get my message about dinner?
yeah, i got your message but i can't make dinner.

## did you watch it?
yeah, i watched the whole thing.

## where do i stand with you?
i talked to tony and he said...

## do me a favour?
write that down for me.

## how're you doing?
i thought you had plans.

## you know what i mean?
but here i am.

## what did i order?
sheriff, this is kerrie, my fiance.

## is he drunk?
oh, you mean, like, back to prison.

## do you have a fork i could use?
i've never been to prison, thus, i can't go back to somewhere i've never been.

## and who are you to tell them to give up their freedom?
i represent a boy sentenced to death.

## demand?
no, no, no.

## yeah, it's insane, ok?
i'm gonna go back.

## ok?
i'm sorry, honey.

## in the middle of this, what matters?
that lewis doesn't die.

## where's the document that guarantees this deal?
the attorney general of malaysia has agreed...

## why don't we have a copy?
it's an oral agreement.

## she's just scared, all right?
she's more scared than i am.

## tony, what can i say?
thank you.

## are you gonna go back to your hotel?
oh, yes.

## so i guess lew's gonna be ok then, huh?
which means, you know...

## i'm off the hook, huh?
good night.

## mj, where's my pension fund fraud?
i thought you had a cpa who was ready to talk.

## sheriff?
ok.

## yeah?

## should i beware of lawyers bearing gifts?
think i'm gonna have a beer.

## uh... beer?

## you're quite the avid reader, aren't you?
or is this just...

## i keep my place real impressive, don't i?
it's nice.

## you know what i mean?
so anyway, i start getting the books and... do some reading, learn about the world around me.

## what?
i just want to see your passport.

## so when you said about me being off the hook, you were just lying to my face?
i think you were lying to yourself.

## it is?
show it to me.

## you'd take three years from me but you wouldn't take my word?
ok.

## you know what?
come on.

## what are you talking about?
wh...

## what?
you offer me money and i don't take that so you figure, \"why don't i fuck the guy cos then he'il do what i want.

## turnabout's fair game, huh?
i found this story first, i'm gonna print it first, period.

## you give me three days three days until the hearing is over, ok?
you promise me that you will not talk to a soul and that i have lewis exclusively.

## smoking crack?
crack is for our african american brethren.

## i can?
whatever you want to do.

## what's wrong?
um...

## what?
i'm gonna miss you.

## one at a time?

## do you mind if i go back there and see him?
no.

## are you sure?
go ahead.

## can you come back here?
i hear you.

## sheriff?
yeah.

## didn't they tell you i was coming?
i was praying.

## yeah?
i'm better now.

## how are you?
i'm all right, man.

## do you want some tea?
i can make some tea.

## you're not cold, are you?
nah, i'm not cold.

## no?
tony is here to see you too.

## why did they take your blanket away?
cos they were scared that i was gonna tear it into strips to hang myself.

## i said, \"hey, guys, what do you think i'm paying you for?
thank you, man.

## where god is apparent?
but in here there's definitely a need to to pray, t t t to beg, to plead, to sing for... for a sign like...

## you know how... how your voice sounds so pretty in the shower?
because... because there's nothing else there.

## do you know how i know?
i know because... because i...

## i ask myself... would i come back for you?
and the only answer is a godless empty evil\"no.

## i didn't come back just for you, you know?
it's all right.

## do you know what i mean?
come here.

## all right?
thanks for the tea.

## yeah?
i knew you'd come back.

## so how bad was it?
i don't know.

## what wasn't good, the prison or lewis?
the prison sucks, for sure.

## is he the same guy we used to know?
i don't think he's lost his mind, but it's not easy sitting around a cell waiting to hang.

## did he tell you anything?
he just babbled a little bit, tone.

## you know, like, rambled a little bit, you know?
like stream of consciousness stuff.

## you want a way out?
find one.

## what do you mean, always?
you're only his lawyer.

## what?
he's my baby brother.

## why didn't you tell me?
i thought you wouldn't trust me, sheriff.

## what are we still doing here?
i wish it was that simple, tony.

## how are we going to trust her, sheriff?
she drags us into this nightmare, we find out it is her personal nightmare.

## what?
i know her.

## what do i owe you to tell you that?

## let me do the talking, okay?
fine.

## i'd like to go to holland in two weeks, to visit my sister. ls that all right?
of course not.

## the new york attack was godzilla, right?
that's what all the american experts claim.

## we're here to solve a mystery as ancient as the mountain itself...... and that mystery concerns the monster of the mountain.
what's that?

## what do you mean?
look.

## what was that?
sure, you go right ahead.

## hey, the camera, you got it?
it's here.

## and who knows?
you may become a movie star.

## what the hell are you doing?
you're gonna kill yourselves.

## hey, what are you talking about?
that's not all.

## a hunch?
don't worry.

## you said there's a witness?
oh, sure, sure.

## and you say the thing was alive?
yeah.

## why's that?
i think you make a great girl.

## so you got my message?
no one believes the moving epicenter story, i'm afraid.

## what's the matter?
i don't like dogs.

## hey, what is that?
i just brought yuri home, sir.

## i don't find this funny, okay?
i'm sorry for all the trouble.

## how do you feel?
fine, thanks.

## something bothering you at work?
no, not at all.

## who was the guy last night?
oh, that's takeda.

## is he your boyfriend?
no, he isn't my boyfriend, thanks.

## is it coincidence?
so some prediction says hundreds of people will die.

## you think we should publish it?
but it isn't just a prediction.

## about last night, you still mad?
look, i'm very sorry.

## why should i be mad at you?
he's just embarrassed for leaving you behind.

## tell me, lieutenant, did you actually see it?
yes.

## and can you describe what you saw?
yes, it was like the fin of a huge creature.

## yeah, but who can prove that it was godzilla?
even if it was godzilla, it hasn't been seen for 50 years.

## why would it choose to come back here?
it doesn't make any sense.

## why should it choose japan again?
nobody can answer that question...... but we have to be ready for the worst scenario.

## couldn't he have picked on some other country?
whenever we increase our defense spending...... we're accused of depleting the government's resources.

## you know him?
i saw him at mount myoko.

## mount myoko in niigata prefecture?
must be a mistake.

## oh, by the way, have you visited our website yet?
yes, it's very interesting.

## ghidorah?
you must wake the thousand year old dragon...... before it's too late.

## do you think that ghidorah is alive?
only 2000 years have gone by.

## yuri, what do you have there?
i'm sure that old man must have put it here.

## what makes you say it was him?
just a hunch, it's a feeling.

## hey, where's that?
oh, the old lady here told me about those.

## this animal represents the collective will to survive...... of many thousands of people.
yeah, but i thought that the army killed godzilla, right?

## say, yuri, do you really believe the old fart, huh?
he's not making it up, i know that.

## really?
that's interesting.

## why does it want to destroy us?
because the japanese people want to forget what happened.

## it seems to have been due to a landslide.
what?

## can you see any survivors?
we'il make another low pass and check.

## you follow me?
if spirits are another form of electricity...... maybe there's a way for them to be stored in stone.

## i don't understand.
but why would he want to do it?

## why attack us, then?
well, what they're defending is our homeland.

## and you really believe that rubbish?
all i can say, father, is his story's believable.

## do you have a better story?
but one thing i don't understand...... is our soldiers died for their country.

## so why do they now want to destroy japan?
but so many other people suffered all over asia.

## don't you see?
i've just returned from the bonins.

## they've canceled everything?
we're to maintain our surveillance.

## do you think we should issue another warning?
i recorded it for my own use.

## then you should be able to convince him...... about the guardian monsters, shouldn't you?
yeah, well, dad's also a navy commander.

## well, if you're sure about it, why not put it on your website?
but i'm telling you, it's true.

## the monster has come up.
what is it?

## a guardian monster or godzilla?
the monster is at least 30 meters long.

## not godzilla?
the information we're receiving is still pretty confused.

## the anti godzilla plan?
negative.

## get the lines ready.
what do you mean?

## ready to go, sir.
what's going on?

## evacuate?
godzilla is just a legend.

## an atom bomb?
yuri.

## so you're not afraid?
no, i want to see it.

## have you got the stone?
in my bag.

## you think it's an amulet?
i think i've found where that monster's heading.

## where?
i think it's heading towards godzilla.

## godzilla?
yes, sir, near hakone.

## but can we be sure he's heading this way?
i'm certain he is.

## why always here?
baragon sighted, sir, at hakone.

## i think the monsters are gonna fight.
have they managed to evacuate everybody yet?

## there are still hundreds of people in the area.
you sure?

## residents have been asked to leave the area calmly...
hey, where's the helicopter?

## hey, miss, will we die?
no, don't worry.

## tell me, miss...... are monsters real?
guardian monsters are, and they're here to save us.

## can i have the car keys?
no, you can't.

## look, haven't you done enough, yuri?
now, a huge cocoon like structure is floating on the lake.

## gen. mikumo, you shall lead the counterattack, understood?
if the boss asks, i said it's okay.

## contact lost...
\"bargain basement of the airwaves\"?

## well, sir?
at the time, i doubted it...... but i taught my men to be proud of what they did.

## if people knew the true story...... then our defense forces would have faced ridicule.
i wonder, was it worth it?

## hence, the need for the utmost secrecy, understand?
so i'm relying on your discretion.

## cmdr. tachibana, do you have a daughter called yuri?
yes, that's right.

## do we know where it is now?
it's heading east from mount fuji.

## what's going to happen, commander?
the guardian monsters are gathering.

## why not name the monsters so we don't get them mixed up, general?
it would make things easier, sir.

## ghidorah?
the guardian monsters are here.

## what the hell's going on out there?
a couple, sir.

## my father?
the captain says you can't stay here, miss.

## why the commander?
he's a commander, a senior officer.

## why does he have to go himself?
because i have the most experience.

## father?
sure, i understand.

## is there a soldier there?
pass him to me.

## commander?
soldier...... give the lady carte blanche.

## ghidorah has been beaten.
what for?

## contact lost.
baragon?

## father?
he came back.

## do you read, salvage sub 2?
i read you.

## why?
professor isayama died a long time ago...... after the first godzilla attack, in fact.

## then who the hell was the old man?
whoever he was, he's gone from the tape.

## good morning.
are you all right?

## are we there yet?
hell, you woke up just in time for the ribbon cutting ceremony.

## listen, i'm no expert, but wouldn't a couch in a headshrinker's office be more comfortable?
well, she's not the only one who needed change.

## my god, people still use those things?
i like to hear what i'm typing.

## do you think it's...?
okay, give it a try.

## shaping up, huh?
i was thinking tomorrow i'd start up on the book.

## what was?
the\"fishing\"for the... never mind.

## don't you think we've had enough time off in the last two years?
but we just got here.

## how about you?
i'm going to need more water.

## the turn carriage on the underwood is, shall i say, faulty?
you think the way those things are built you could drop it off a 10 story building and it'd still type out\"war and peace.

## how about duck?
you know, chantrelle's has claim to the finest duck fricassee in all of new york's grandiose french fare.

## would you put that away?
please.

## molly, did you load this?
if you want rice, we're going to need more water.

## what?
let go of me.

## 10 years living together in the city, you don't even like to carry pepper spray in your purse, molly.
where are they?

## pills can be just pumped from your stomach.
and now... what?

## is that right?
i did not know that.

## anybody out there?
don't move.

## what are you doing to her?
well, nothing that concerns you.

## you hear what i said?
i asked you...

## come again?
i want you to take those handcuffs off her.

## why would i do that?
i want you to put them on.

## why would i do such a thing like that?
no.

## robert?
oh, baby.

## what do we do?
under normal circumstances i'd call the police, but...

## am i positive?
no, molly.

## what?
i'm right here.

## what are you doing?
i'm not leaving her.

## if we can't trust the law, what choice do we have?
i saved her life.

## where are you going?
it's not like you can snap your fingers and make everything go away.

## what's your 20?
oh my god.

## did you kill him?
yeah.

## feeling any better?
it hurts to breathe sometimes, but i think i'm just bruised mostly.

## where is sheriff dodd?
he won't ever be able to hurt you again.

## would you be in danger if you were to go back home?
no, no, i can't go back.

## do you have any family we need to contact, or friends?
that's not what i meant.

## what was that all about?
it was like you were attacking her.

## really?
i don't understand any of it.

## what do we do?
hide.

## who's coming for you?
just go.

## robert graves?
i have a summons for you.

## what did i do?
nothing yet.

## hey son, molly inside?

## an auction?
byron and i are head of the renovation committee.

## little?
there are 20 blue haired ladies that have read it.

## you coming in to buy something?
uh... well, not today.

## are you still open for business?
business starts and stops when i say.

## you may not get the shakes like your old man, but you've... you've hidden a few bottles under the bed, huh?
you sound like the kind of guy who's got the drop on everyone in reedsville.

## me?
i guess can you can say i've got an eye for the obvious.

## all right?
okay.

## did i scare you?
no.

## would you like me to stay?
listen i'm sorry about the parade, son.

## speaking of hospitality, who's the nazi at the feed store?
you must mean t. wallace.

## tell you to move your truck?
he took a picture of my license plate.

## why don't we get started?
our first item here is donated by the reedsville photographic society.

## how well do you know the mayor?
95.

## you ever feel like killing somebody?
my hair was that long once.

## why did you cut it?
it got in the way.

## what?
um... my daughter, when she was little, she would lie in bed behind me and twist my hair around her finger.

## what did she do when you cut it?
she never knew i did.

## did you see what happened?
yeah, that's him.

## who's in the trunk?
no, no, no.

## what are you doing?
molly, stay out of this.

## but who's the other guy, rae?
cause i don't remember killing him.

## oh you want to go?
out of the sheriff's squad car.

## you mean the man you killed... he was carrying this?
i think he was buying something.

## what?
ask her.

## or do you think maybe i should just show her?
you want to show her more than anything.

## is that what's happening?
i don't want to talk about this...

## did t. wallace take these pictures?
we just want to understand this, rae.

## i want to know everything.
did t. wallace take those pictures?

## it's okay.
who's behind all of this?

## this year hasn't been very kind to us, has it, rae?
no, sir.

## robbie...

## you see, it seems your wife here has a... oh, hell, why say anything when a picture tells a thousand words?
oh.

## we some of that\"mess\"you was talking about cleaning up?
yeah, you caused the mayor a world of trouble, and it's time you two disappeared.

## can i talk to you for a minute?
yeah.

## are we packing up the shed, too?
we'il talk about that later.

## the three of us, huh?
something my old man told me once keeps popping back into my head.

## what's that?
he said the two hardest things in this world to catch is a pop fly at a day game, and a young woman when she's lying.

## you don't believe her?
i don't know.

## you saw the sheriff try to kill her, what do you think?
i think $200, 000 is a lot of money.

## kind of cuts out the middleman with you and me, don't you think?
it's not ours to take, robert.

## you don't know why i took it?
jesus, there hasn't been a day since ashley died you haven't reminded me that we are broke and life isn't worth living anymore.

## do you think if there was a chance, i wouldn't hack off my right arm?
i'd have done anything.

## what do you want?
i want to stop fixing things.

## you know what will help me, molly?
a big black bag.

## is that one of your stories?
yeah, i think it makes a better campfire, though.

## where's molly?
asleep.

## in relation to what we got going on in the shed?
that's what we're talking about here.

## money?
money.

## you're just taking the long way around the pond, huh?
in civil court you just need a preponderance of evidence.

## less to prove, right?
it's easier to convict.

## cigarette?
nah, i'm burning up already.

## how can justice prevail?
you sure sound like you know what you're talking about.

## well... this is between us and them, right?
this is a civil matter.

## so you're saying you never fired it?
no.

## a homicide?
yes, a multiple homicide.

## like what?
that's what i'm trying to figure out here.

## are you sure?
i'm positive.

## what's that?
well, i didn't mention gunshots.

## you know what?
when you put it that way...

## are you sure you don't want a soda or anything?
no, thank you.

## say... you ever serve in the army?
no.

## why?
i was just wondering.

## robert didn't come home last night.
how could you do that?

## where is he?
cops came, took him away.

## you're like a little house bird.
why should i believe you?

## you know that, molly?
without somebody taking care of you or that little house you done built up, you could be squashed in a fist.

## why'd you have to beat on him so much?
he ran.

## what's your problem?
take off the handcuffs.

## you mind if i sit?
now don't be sore at old byron here.

## that, uh... remains to be seen, don't you think?
you're... bleeding there.

## why don't you ask him?
he's the one who took 'em.

## you mean t?
well, now, we've had our differences over the years, but he would never do something like that to me.

## then why is he here?
well, you killed his brother for one.

## what is it you want from me?
mr. graves, we're it.

## ain't that right, t?
like he said, you can be part of\"old reedsville.

## so what, you're just gonna kill her?
no.

## how do you get all these fools wrapped around your finger?
i've been hanging out with some of your friends.

## where's my money?
that money buys your life back.

## now where is she?
you like plain talk after all.

## robert, can't you see?
we just wanted to start over.

## okay?
i just... just want a new life.

## isn't that what you want?
or maybe you'd like a life with me.

## didn't i tell you they'd kill us all?
i don't understand you.

## really?
then do it.

## herman?
give you peace which surpasses all understanding.

## she's been dead for a long time, don't you think?
i made up my mind.

## yeah?
well, i have.

## what you doing, molly?
putting one foot in front of the other.

## did you know your typewriter's broken?
it's too bad.

## where's that?
anywhere with you.

## are we there yet?
hell, you woke up just in time for the ribbon cutting ceremony.

## listen, i'm no expert, but wouldn't a couch in a headshrinker's office be more comfortable?
well, she's not the only one who needed change.

## my god, people still use those things?
i like to hear what i'm typing.

## do you think it's...?
okay, give it a try.

## shaping up, huh?
i was thinking tomorrow i'd start up on the book.

## what was?
the\"fishing\"for the never mind.

## don't you think we've had enough time off in the last two years?
but we just got here.

## how about you?
i'm going to need more water.

## the turn carriage on the underwood is, shall i say, faulty?
you think the way those things are built you could drop it off a 10 story building and it'd still type out\"war and peace.

## how about duck?
you know, chantrelle's has claim to the finest duck fricassee in all of new york's grandiose french fare.

## would you put that away?
if you want rice, we're going to need more water.

## what?
let go of me.

## 10 years living together in the city, you don't even like to carry pepper spray in your purse, molly.
where are they?

## pills can be just pumped from your stomach.
and now what?

## is that right?
i did not know that.

## anybody out there?
don't move.

## what are you doing to her?
well, nothing that concerns you.

## you hear what i said?
i asked you  those handcuffs.

## come again?
i want you to take those handcuffs off her.

## why would i do that?
i want you to put them on.

## why would i do such a thing like that?
oh, baby.

## am i positive?
no, molly.

## what?
i'm right here.

## what are you doing?
i'm not leaving her.

## if we can't trust the law, what choice do we have?
i saved her life.

## where are you going?
it's not like you can snap your fingers and make everything go away.

## what's your 20?
oh my god.

## did you kill him?
yeah.

## feeling any better?
it hurts to breathe sometimes, but i think i'm just bruised mostly.

## where is sheriff dodd?
he won't ever be able to hurt you again.

## would you be in danger if you were to go back home?
no, no, i can't go back.

## do you have any family we need to contact, or friends?
it was like you were attacking her.

## really?
i don't understand any of it.

## what do we do?
hide.

## who's coming for you?
just go.

## robert graves?
i have a summons for you.

## what did i do?
nothing yet.

## hey son, molly inside?
uh... no.

## what can i do for you boys?
we want to talk to you about this.

## an auction?
byron and i are head of the renovation committee.

## little?
there are 20 blue haired ladies that have read it.

## you coming in to buy something?
uh... well, not today.

## are you still open for business?
business starts and stops when i say.

## you may not get the shakes like your old man, but you've you've hidden a few bottles under the bed, huh?
you sound like the kind of guy who's got the drop on everyone in reedsville.

## me?
i guess can you can say i've got an eye for the obvious.

## all right?
okay.

## did i scare you?
no.

## would you like me to stay?
listen i'm sorry about the parade, son.

## speaking of hospitality, who's the nazi at the feed store?
you must mean t. wallace.

## tell you to move your truck?
he took a picture of my license plate.

## why don't we get started?
our first item here is donated by the reedsville photographic society.

## how well do you know the mayor?
95.

## you ever feel like killing somebody?
my hair was that long once.

## why did you cut it?
it got in the way.

## what?
um... my daughter, when she was little, she would lie in bed behind me and twist my hair around her finger.

## what did she do when you cut it?
she never knew i did.

## did you see what happened?
yeah, that's him.

## who's in the trunk?
no, no, no.

## what are you doing?
molly, stay out of this.

## but who's the other guy, rae?
cause i don't remember killing him.

## oh you want to go?
out of the sheriff's squad car.

## you mean the man you killed he was carrying this?
i think he was buying something.

## what?
ask her.

## or do you think maybe i should just show her?
you want to show her more than anything.

## i don't want to talk about this  did t. wallace take these pictures?
we just want to understand this, rae.

## i want to know everything.
did t. wallace take those pictures?

## it's okay.
who's behind all of this?

## this year hasn't been very kind to us, has it, rae?
no, sir.

## robbie...  you see, it seems your wife here has a oh, hell, why say anything when a picture tells a thousand words?
oh.

## we some of that\"mess\"you was talking about cleaning up?
yeah, you caused the mayor a world of trouble, and it's time you two disappeared.

## can i talk to you for a minute?
yeah.

## are we packing up the shed, too?
we'il talk about that later.

## the three of us, huh?
something my old man told me once keeps popping back into my head.

## what's that?
he said the two hardest things in this world to catch is a pop fly at a day game, and a young woman when she's lying.

## you don't believe her?
i think $200, 000 is a lot of money.

## kind of cuts out the middleman with you and me, don't you think?
it's not ours to take, robert.

## you don't know why i took it?
jesus, there hasn't been a day since ashley died you haven't reminded me that we are broke and life isn't worth living anymore.

## do you think if there was a chance, i wouldn't hack off my right arm?
i'd have done anything.

## what do you want?
i want to stop fixing things.

## you know what will help me, molly?
a big black bag.

## is that one of your stories?
yeah, i think it makes a better campfire, though.

## where's molly?
asleep.

## in relation to what we got going on in the shed?
that's what we're talking about here.

## money?
money.

## you're just taking the long way around the pond, huh?
in civil court you just need a preponderance of evidence.

## less to prove, right?
it's easier to convict.

## cigarette?
nah, i'm burning up already.

## how can justice prevail?
you sure sound like you know what you're talking about.

## well... this is between us and them, right?
this is a civil matter.

you saved my life.

## you want to take the money?

## after all, what is money?
it's the power to buy ourselves something that'il make us happier.

i bought it today.

## isn't it lovely?

## i do think it does something for me, don't you?
yes, it makes you look rather ridiculous.

## you're really quite beautiful, aren't you?
lf you think so, darling.

## no, why?
i understand they do a good job of shrinking heads.

## this, for instance?
maybe i better go back and see another double feature.

## why do we have to go through all this?
it's the army's way of finding out if you really want to get married.

## well, gates?
i'm sorry to bother you, but we haven't heard a word in over a week.

he's getting nervous, and so am i.

well, i put it down there in case we got mugged.

## who is gonna mug two black fellas holding pistols...... sat in a car that's worth less than your shirt?
bullet tooth tony and his friend, desert eagle. 50.

## what have they got to do with anything?
they're both staring straight at me.

## why's he sweating?
oh, never mind.

## tommy, why is your skin leaking?
i'm a little worried, actually.

## i mean, he's done it before, hasn't he?
we get murdered before we leave the building, and we get fed to the pigs.

## what ifhe doesn't make it to the fourth round?
we get murdered before leaving the building...... and i imagine we get fed to the pigs.

## it's not as though we've got a choice, now, is it?
you show me how to control a wild fucking gypsy...... and i'il show you how to control an unhinged, pig feeding gangster.

## it's a bit funky in here, isn't it?
open a window.

## come on, where is it?
it's over here.

## where?
i left it in a box.

## now then, let's have a look, shall we?

they're over there now.

## how long have we gotta stay here?
as long as it takes.

## ls he fucking stoned?
he's like that before a fight.

## do you know when you're going down?
of course he knows when he's going down.

## fuck face?

## do you understand the consequences of knocking that man out?
do not knock him out, mickey.

## what is he doing?
come on and sit.

## what the fuck are you doing, mickey?
you're dancing like a fairy.

## and, hey, presto, there's a car nearly on you.
ever cross the road and look the wrong way?

## so, what do you do?
something very silly.

## why?
because he had plans on running the car over.

## where is he?
he ain't fucking here, that's for sure.

## we can't ask a man to fight for us if we can't find him, can we?
you won't find a pikey that doesn't want to be found.

## so, what you doing here?
i'm taking the dog for a walk.

## what's in the car?
seats and a steering wheel.

## what do you know about gypsies?
i know they're not to be trusted.

## oh, you love a dog, don't you, tommy?
tommy persuaded me to keep the dog.

## so, what do you do?
you go see the man that knows about these sort of things.

## do you know anyone who'd be interested?
i might.

## can i see?
finders keepers.

## did you have dream?
nightmare.

## worse than this place?
they are going to fight you.

## again?
until they kill you.

## can they kill me before breakfast?
you are in hell, little man.

## why?
for protection.

## are you so desperate to fight criminals...... that you lock yourself in to take them on one at a time?
actually, there were seven of them.

## how do you know my name?
the world is too small for someone like bruce wayne to disappear...... no matter how deep he chooses to sink.

## who are you?
my name is merely ducard, but i speak for ra's al ghul...... a man greatly feared by the criminal underworld.

## what makes you think i need a path?
someone like you is only here by choice.

## and what path can ra's al ghul offer?
the path of a man who shares his hatred of evil...... and wishes to serve true justice.

## which is?
legend, mr. wayne.

## and what was i looking for?
only you can know that.

## ra's al ghul?
wait.

## what are you seeking?
i seek...... the means to fight injustice.

## are you ready to begin?
i can....

## bruce?
it's okay.

## will we be needing an ambulance, master wayne?
no, i'il set the bone and take him for an x ray later.

## and why do we fall?
so we can learn to pick ourselves up.

## you know why they attacked you, don't you?
they were afraid of you.

## afraid of me?
all creatures feel fear.

## even the scary ones?
especially the scary ones.

## you think your mother will like them?
yeah.

## did you build this train, dad?
gotham's been good to our family, but the city's been suffering.

## is that where you work?
no, i work at the hospital.

## better?
well...... more interested men.

## can we go?
please.

## what's wrong, bruce?
no, no.

## right, bruce?
come on.

## is this your father's?
it's okay.

## yes, master bruce?
it was my fault, alfred.

## do you understand?
i miss them, alfred.

## and do you still feel responsible for your parents 'death?
my anger outweighs my guilt.

## invisible?
the ninja understands that invisibility is a matter of patience and agility.

## as weapons?
or distractions.

## who is he?
he was a farmer.

## what'il happen to him?
justice.

## would that stop you?
i've had training.

## what stopped it?
vengeance.

## will you be heading back to princeton after the hearing, sir...... or can i persuade you to stay on for a day or two?
i'm not heading back at all.

## you don't like it there?
i like it fine.

## why do you give a damn, alfred?
it's not your family.

## should i just bury the past out there with my parents, alfred?
i wouldn't presume to tell you what to do with your past, sir.

## haven't given up on me yet?
never.

## hasn't he noticed you're tall enough to reach now?
old habits die hard, i guess.

## how's your mom?
she misses this place.

## then why is your boss letting him go?
in prison, he shared a cell with carmine falcone.

## mr. chill?
your honor...... not a day goes by that i don't wish i could take back what i did.

## you don't mean that.
has he got anything to say?

## what if i do, rachel?
my parents deserved justice.

## you care about justice?
look beyond your own pain, bruce.

## you wanna thank him for that?
here you go.

## what chance does gotham have when the good people do nothing?
i'm not one of your good people, rachel.

## what do you mean?
all these years, i wanted to kill him.

## no gun?
i'm insulted.

## for what?
your jacket.

## who?
everyone.

## when you lived among the criminals, did you start to pity them?
the first time i stole so that i wouldn 't starve, yes.

## what do i care what your name is?
you're a criminal.

## corrupt bureaucrats?
criminals mock society's laws.

## and where would i be leading these men?
gotham.

## how?
gotham's time has come.

## what are you doing?
what's necessary, my friend.

## are you coming back to gotham for long, sir?
as long as it takes.

## did it?
in a way.

## what symbol?
something elemental...... something terrifying.

## you're thinking about rachel?
actually, sir, i was thinking of myself.

## have you told anyone i'm coming back?
i couldn't figure the legal ramifications of bringing you back from the dead.

## dead?
you've been gone seven years.

## you had me declared dead?
actually, it was mr. earle.

## i would hardly have testified to that otherwise, would l?
this is the third of falcone's thugs you've had declared insane...... and moved into your asylum.

## what are you doing, carl?
looking out for you.

## how can you say that?
yes, he is.

## who's bothering you?
there's a girl at the da's office.

## idealist, huh?
well, there's an answer to that too.

## name?
bruce wayne.

## where are you?
eye on the ball, and....

## why is no one answering the phone?
it's wayne enterprises, mr. earle.

## bruce?
you're supposed to be dead.

## who?
wayne.

## oh?
i just want to get to know the company that my family built.

## any ideas where you would start?
applied sciences caught my eye.

## what did they tell you this place was?
they didn't tell me anything.

## you were on the board?
when your father ran things.

## you knew my father?
oh, yeah.

## tear resistant?
this sucker will stop a knife.

## bulletproof?
anything but a straight shot.

## why didn't they put it into production?
bean counters didn't think...... a soldier's life was worth 300 grand.

## so, what's your interest in it, mr. wayne?
i want to borrow it.

## they'il have to be large orders, to avoid suspicion.
spelunking?

## how large?
say 10, 000.

## in a town this bent, who's there to rat to anyway?
don't turn around.

## what do you want?
carmine falcone brings in shipments of drugs every week.

## why?
he's paid up with the right people.

## what will it take to bring him down?
leverage on judge faden...... and a da brave enough to prosecute.

## who are you?
watch for my sign.

## you're just one man?
now we're two.

## what the hell was that?
just some nut.

## more spelunking?
no.

## that like parachuting?
kind of.

## do you have any lightweight fabrics?
you know, i think i have just the thing.

## notice anything?
regularly flexible...... but put a current through it...... molecules realign, it becomes rigid.

## what kind of shapes can you make?
can be tailored to fit any structure based on a rigid skeleton.

## too expensive for the army?
i don't think they tried to market it to the billionaire, base jumping crowd.

## fair enough.
yes, sir?

## the tumbler?
oh, you wouldn't be interested in that.

## does it come in black?
i need you at the docks thursday.

## problems?
i don't want any trouble...

## ls that right?
and that there's a fat prize...... waiting for anybody willing to do anything about it.

## have you seen the girl?
it's a cute little assistant da.

## don 't you think that's a little too much heat to bring down, maybe?
even for this town.

## why bats, master wayne?
bats frighten me.

## what is this?
continue.

## what's the difference?
lgnorance is bliss, my friend.

## what the...?
i better check it.

## what the hell are you?
i'm batman.

## why?
you rattled his cage.

## what's this?
leverage.

## for what?
to get things moving.

## who are you?
someone like you.

## does it matter?
we'il never tie him to it anyway.

## what the hell is that?
cut him down.

## yeah?
this guy did deliver us...... one of the city's biggest crime lords.

## understand?
no way to bury it now.

## what about this bat they babble about?
even if these guys will swear to being thrashed by a giant bat...... we've got falcone at the scene.

## what does someone like me do?
drive sports cars, date movie stars.

## missing?
yeah.

## huh?
well, a guy who dresses up like a bat clearly has issues.

## what does that tell you?
they're jealous.

## rachel?
i'd heard you were back.

## what are you doing?
just swimming here.

## how are things?
the same.

## not at all.
what choice do i have...... when you're too busy swimming?

## he cut his wrists?
probably looking for the insanity plea.

## what do you want?
i wanna know...... how you're gonna convince me to keep my mouth shut.

## about what?
you don't know anything.

## would you like to see my mask?
i use it in my experiments.

## so when did the nut take over the nut house?
they scream and they cry...... much as you're doing now.

## what about the other half?
flass knows.

## what do you think?
i think you're trying to help.

## where were the other drugs going?
i never knew.

## why?
there was something something else in the drugs...

## what?
i never went to the drop off point.

## this is the one i'm talking about.
do i look like a cop?

## what's your problem with it?
it shouldn't exist.

## it's you, isn't it?
everybody's been talking about you.

## having trouble?
take a seat.

## do you want my opinion?
you need to lighten up.

## how long was i out?
two days.

## am i meant to understand any of that?
not at all.

## you planning on gassing yourself again, mr. wayne?
well, you know how it is.

## you sure you don't want to come in?
i have to get back.

## rachel?
looks like someone's been burning the candle at both ends.

## you've got better plans?
my boss has been missing for days...... which means i should probably start by looking...

## who authorized that?
get crane down there now.

## what's wrong?
it's falcone.

## you're going to arkham now?
it's in the narrows, rachel.

## now, what's a big shot like you doing in a place like this?
i need some information.

## rumor was they tested dispersing water based chemicals into the air...... but isn't that illegal?
i want all the information on the development of this project...... all data, files, backup disks, on my desk right away.

## did you lose one?
i'm merging your department with archives.

## didn't you get the memo?
scarecrow.

## such as?
as you can see for yourself, there is nothing convenient about his symptoms.

## what's\"scarecrow\"?
in this case, a scarecrow.

## he's drugged?
psychopharmacology is my primary field.

## who knows?
he's here.

## who?
the batman.

## what do we do?
what anyone does...... when a prowler comes around.

## you want the cops here?
at this point, they can't stop us.

## what about her?
she hasn't got long.

## can he really fly?
i heard he can disappear.

## who are you working for?
ra's ra's al ghul.

## who are you working for?
crane.

## what are you waiting for?
backup.

## backup?
the batman's in there.

## what's happened to her?
crane poisoned her with a psychotropic hallucinogen, a panic inducing toxin.

## what was he planning?
i don't know.

## was he working for falcone?
he mentioned someone else, someone worse.

## how long does she have?
not long.

## what is that?
backup.

## what the?
excuse me.

## how is she?
she's fading.

## yours?
i've gotta get me one of those.

## make and color?
it's a black...... tank.

## what are you doing?
shortcut.

## where's he going?
he's on the roof.

## what street is he taking?
he's not on a street.

## what?
yeah.

## why haven't we felt the effects?
must be a compound that has to be absorbed through the lungs.

## why did you bring me here?
lf i hadn't, your mind would be lost.

## is sergeant gordon your friend?
i don't have the luxury of friends.

## what are they?
the antidote.

## mass production?
crane was just a pawn.

## what would you call that?
damn good television.

## ls fox still here?
yes, sir.

## how did the stock offering go?
prices soared.

## who was buying?
all kinds of funds and brokerages.

## how were you gonna get your toxin into the air?
scarecrow.

## who were you working for, crane?
oh, it's too late.

## how long would it take to manufacture on a large scale?
weeks.

## why?
somebody's planning to disperse the toxin using the water supply.

## what?
unless you have a microwave emitter powerful enough...... to vaporize all the water in the mains.

## misplaced?
earle just fired me for asking too many questions about it.

## that wouldn't stop a man like you, would it?
i suppose not.

## now, am i pronouncing this right...... mr. ra's al ghul?
you're not ra's al ghul.

## or cheap parlor tricks to conceal your true identity, ra's?
surely a man who spends his nights scrambling over the rooftops of gotham...... wouldn't begrudge me dual identities.

## everybody?
i....

## he's not a member of the league of shadows?
of course not.

## you attacked gotham before?
of course.

## how many from maximum security?
everything my family...... my father, built....

## why do we fall, sir?
so that we can learn to pick ourselves up.

## you still haven't given up on me?
madman with a gun.

## what are you doing here?
gentlemen...... time to spread the word.

## what the hell is going on?
no.

## so i'm on my own?
the narrows is tearing itself to pieces.

## how are they gonna do that?
the train.

## it's not who i am underneath...... but what i do that defines me.
what do you need?

## bruce?
well, well.

## i can't beat two of your pawns?
as you wish.

## who the hell authorized this?
distance to wayne tower, three miles.

## that's why you couldn't fight injustice, that's why you can't stop this train.
don't you have anything new?

## have you finally learned to do what is necessary?
i won't kill you...

## what meeting?
fox, i seem to remember firing you.

## on whose authority?
batman may have made the front page...... but bruce wayne got pushed to page eight.

## what makes you think you can decide who's running wayne enterprises?
the fact that i'm the owner.

## what are you talking about?
the company went public a week ago.

## right, mr. fox?
right you are, mr. wayne.

## didn't you get the memo?
i'm sorry i didn't tell you, rachel.

## about what?
your father would be very proud of you.

## what will you do?
rebuild it.

## yeah, why?
i thought this might be a good opportunity for...... improving the foundations.

## ln the southeast corner?
precisely, sir.

## well, sergeant?
it's\"lieutenant\"now.

## but?
the narrows is lost.

## escalation?
we start carrying semiautomatics, they buy automatics.

## and?
and you're wearing a mask...... and jumping off rooftops.

## can i see?
finders keepers.

## did you have dream?
nightmare.

## worse than this place?

i don't want any trouble...

## is that right?
and that there's a fat prize...... waiting for anybody willing to do anything about it.

## have you seen the girl?
flass it's a cute little assistant da.

## don't you think that's a little too much heat to bring down, maybe?
even for this town.

## what's the difference?

## understand?
no way to bury it now.

## what about this bat they babble about?

## what does someone like me do?
drive sports cars, date movie stars.

## missing?
yeah.

## huh?
well, a guy who dresses up like a bat clearly has issues.

## what does that tell you?
they're jealous.

## rachel?
i'd heard you were back.

## what are you doing?
just swimming here.

## how are things?
the same.

## not at all.
what choice do i have...... when you're too busy swimming?

## he cut his wrists?
probably looking for the insanity plea.

## what do you want?
i wanna know...... how you're gonna convince me to keep my mouth shut.

## about what?
you don't know anything.

## would you like to see my mask?
i use it in my experiments.

## do you want my opinion?
you need to lighten up.

## how long was i out?
two days.

## am i meant to understand any of that?
not at all.

## you planning on gassing yourself again, mr. wayne?
well, you know how it is.

## you sure you don't want to come in?
i have to get back.

## rachel?
looks like someone's been burning the candle at both ends.

## you've got better plans?
my boss has been missing for days...... which means i should probably start by looking...

## who authorized that?
get crane down there now.

## what's wrong?
it's falcone.

## you're going to arkham now?
it's in the narrows, rachel.

## now, what's a big shot like you doing in a place like this?
i need some information.

## rumor was they tested dispersing water based chemicals into the air...... but isn't that illegal?
i want all the information on the development of this project...... all data, files, backup disks, on my desk right away.

## did you lose one?
i'm merging your department with archives.

## didn't you get the memo?

in this case, a scarecrow.

## he's drugged?
psychopharmacology is my primary field.

## who knows?
he's here.

## who?
the batman.

## what do we do?
what anyone does...... when a prowler comes around.

## you want the cops here?
at this point, they can't stop us.

## what about her?
she hasn't got long.

## can he really fly?
i heard he can disappear.

## who are you working for?
ra's ra's al ghul.

## who are you working for?
crane.

## what are you waiting for?
backup.

## backup?
the batman's in there.

## what's happened to her?
crane poisoned her with a psychotropic hallucinogen, a panic inducing toxin.

## what was he planning?
i don't know.

## was he working for falcone?
he mentioned someone else, someone worse.

## how long does she have?
not long.

## what is that?
backup.

## what the?
excuse me.

## where's he going?
he's on the roof.

## what street is he taking?
he's not on a street.

## what?
y eah.

## why haven't we felt the effects?
must be a compound that has to be absorbed through the lungs.

## why did you bring me here?
if i hadn't, your mind would be lost.

## is sergeant gordon your friend?
i don't have the luxury of friends.

## what are they?
the antidote.

## mass production?
crane was just a pawn.

## what would you call that?
damn good television.

## is fox still here?
yes, sir.

## how did the stock offering go?
prices soared.

## who was buying?
all kinds of funds and brokerages.

## how were you gonna get your toxin into the air?
scarecrow.

## who were you working for, crane?
oh, it's too late.

## how long would it take to manufacture on a large scale?
weeks.

## why?
somebody's planning to disperse the toxin using the water supply.

## what?
unless you have a microwave emitter powerful enough...... to vaporize all the water in the mains.

## misplaced?
earle just fired me for asking too many questions about it.

## that wouldn't stop a man like you, would it?
i suppose not.

## now, am i pronouncing this right...... mr. ra's al ghul?
you're not ra's al ghul.

## or cheap parlor tricks to conceal your true identity, ra's?
surely a man who spends his nights scrambling over the rooftops of gotham...... wouldn't begrudge me dual identities.

## everybody?
i...

## he's not a member of the league of shadows?
of course not.

## you attacked gotham before?
of course.

## how many from maximum security?
everything my family...... my father, built...

madman with a gun.

## what are you doing here?
gentlemen...... time to spread the word.

## what the hell is going on?
no.

## so i'm on my own?
the narrows is tearing itself to pieces.

what do you need?

## bruce?
well, well.

## i can't beat two of your pawns?
as you wish.

## who the hell authorized this?
distance to wayne tower, three miles.

## that's why you couldn't fight injustice, that's why you can't stop this train.
don't you have anything new?

## have you finally learned to do what is necessary?
i won't kill you...

## what meeting?
fox, i seem to remember firing you.

## on whose authority?
batman may have made the front page...... but bruce wayne got pushed to page eight.

## what makes you think you can decide who's running wayne enterprises?
the fact that i'm the owner.

## what are you talking about?
the company went public a week ago.

## right, mr. fox?
right you are, mr. wayne.

## didn't you get the memo?
i'm sorry i didn't tell you, rachel.

## about what?
your father would be very proud of you.

## what will you do?

## yeah, why?

## what the fuck is tantric?
it's a buddhist discipline.

## and this stuff's for real?
it's been around for centuries.

## well, maybe you can teach me sometime?
very doubtful.

## oh, no?

## do you know where i could find michelle flaherty?

## okay, what do you wanna do?

## all right, you know what?
let's find kemper and get the hell out of here.

## where you going?
to find him.

## well, who put you in charge?
if you guys just want to take off, that's fine, but i am not getting in that van and leaving without him.

## we're just looking for our friend, all right?
then we'il be out of here.

## where's the gun?
oh, thank god.

## now, what's wrong with your car?
there's nothing wrong with my car.

## somebody want to explain this?
lt... that's not mine.

## you kids taking drugs?
no.

## get your sweet little ass back in the dirt until i say otherwise.
who's killing who?

## you know what i think?
i think your boyfriend shot that little girl and then he ran off.

## why won't you listen to her?
get on your feet.

## is that where she was sitting?
because the angle don't add up for me with the blood on that back window.

## i don't have much of an imagination, so i need to get a distinct image of what went down here.
but... what, are you afraid of a little blood?

## what did she do next?
she... she shot herself.

## what do you mean, how?
yes.

## didn't she?
show me how she did it.

## and then what did she do?
she shot herself.

## you ain't lying to me again, are you?
because i have never seen a weapon go off without somebody's finger on the fucking trigger.

## you ok?
morgan, please, please.

## just please put the gun down, ok?
morgan, please, just put it down.

## yeah, you got rights, ok.
where are you taking him?

## where was y'all headed?
dallas... for a skynyrd concert.

## skynyrd?
hell, i like skynyrd.

## we got something in common, don't we?
ha ha ha.

## well, what are you gonna do with your tickets now, hot shot?
you can have them.

## oh, that was really rude, wasn't it?
oh, look at you.

## how about that?
look at that shit.

## see that?
get on over to the damn crawford mill.

## pepper, i need you to hold that light really steady.
what do you think he's doing to morgan?

## where'd you learn how to do that?
in juvie.

## come on.
where are we?

## why don't you have a seat?
he's gonna kill you.

## didn't you look at his face?
oh.

## you ok, child?
you don't look so good.

## she likes me.
does anybody care about me and my boy?

## what's wrong with you fucking people?
here's your pants.

## are you ok?
here.

## where are we going?
i'm going to get you some help.

## huh?
i just want to go home.

## you live around here?
no.

## what do you want?
i picked up a girl.

## you got it?
all right.

## got it?
that's ok.

## for why?
for there the priests are very holy.

## is it anything interesting, matthew?
bless you, sir.

## what's he want?
me.

## when?
now.

## in hampton court?
you won't be there by midnight.

## what is the man?
a butcher's son.

## what's the man?
surely, your grace, when a man rises so high and so swiftly...... we must think he was misplaced in his origins.

## what was that you said, richard?
nothing, sir thomas, it was out of place.

## who is that?
a young friend from cambridge.

## what do they all want?
a position.

## do you recommend him?
no.

## did you recommend me?
no.

## what position?
not now, richard.

## why did you oppose me?
i thought your grace was wrong.

## i, your grace?
spare me your discretion.

## more, are you going to help me?
if your grace will be specific.

## what are you going to do about it?
i'm very sure the king needs no advice from me on what to do about it.

## then he needs a son.
do you favour a change of dynasty?

## i repeat, what are you going to do about it?
i pray for it daily.

## are you going to pray for a miracle?
there are precedents.

## have i your support, or have i not?
the pope gave a dispensation, so that the king might marry...... his brother's widow for state reasons.

## we are to ask the pope to dispense with his dispensation, also for state reasons?
i don't like plodding, thomas.

## well?
then, clearly all we have to do is to approach his holiness and ask him.

## by argument?
argument certainly.

## pressure, applied to the church?
the church has its church property.

## is that what you want?
very well.

## to govern the country with prayers?
yes, i should.

## suffolk?
fisher for me.

## what about my secretary, master cromwell?
cromwell.

## but?
goodnight, sir thomas.

## what's this?
from some grateful poor folk, in leicester.

## leicester?
chelsea.

## you've got a licence?
bless you, yes sir, i've got a licence.

## have you been here all night?
yes.

## you said there was a post?
yes.

## what post?
at the new school.

## cromwell?
well, if you know cromwell you don't need my help.

## sir thomas?
if only you knew how much, much rather, i had your help than his.

## why not?
look.

## thank you.
what is it?

## what will you do with it?
sell it.

## a man should go where he won't be tempted.
and buy what?

## why not be a teacher?
you'd be a fine teacher.

## yes, talking with the cardinal.
lf i was, who would know it?

## it's eating your heart out, isn't it?
the high affairs of state.

## right, sir.
the divorce?

## sir thomas?
thank you.

## lady alice in bed?
yes, sir.

## lady margaret?
no, sir.

## who let him in?
he's a hard man to keep out, sir.

## ls your horse here?
no, sir, i walked.

## may i come again?
yes.

## is that final, father?
as long as he's a heretic, meg, that's absolute.

## what did wolsey want?
nice boy, young will.

## was it the divorce?
to bed.

## what did wolsey want?
will roper's been.

## will roper?
yes, he's been here all night.

## have you any message for his majesty?
if i had served god...... one half so well as i've served my king...... god would not have left me here, to die in this place.

## what's he really coming for?
to talk about the divorce.

## can you dance, too?
yes, your grace.

## you're my friend, are you not?
your majesty.

## you know that wolsey named you for chancellor?
before he died, wolsey named you, and wolsey was no fool.

## then, why did he fail me?
it was villainy then.

## because i'm simple and plain and deal with every man straightforwardly.
what is it?

## because of that i say, do they take me for a simpleton?
wolsey was a proud man, thomas.

## have you thought of it since we last spoke?
of little else.

## that you should put away queen catherine, sire?
everyone else does.

## then, why does your grace need my poor support?
because you're honest.

## how'd you like our music?
that air they played, it had a certain....

## then i will tell my true opinion.
could it have been your grace's own?

## well?
i hardly know myself.

## what's that?
eight o'clock, your grace.

## shall we eat?
if your grace pleases.

## why?
no.

## thomas?
stay friends with him.

## have l?
so meg tells me.

## sir thomas.
if it's true, is it a matter for congratulation?

## richard?
i fell.

## do you know william roper, the younger?
by reputation, of course.

## you've heard of me?
yes.

## in what connection?
i don't know what you can have heard.

## have you done something to make you not welcome?
cromwell is asking questions.

## of whom?
of him, for one.

## how?
yes.

## and when the last law was down, and the devil turned on you...... where would you hide, roper, the laws all being flat?
yes.

## master rich?
yes.

## rich?
come in.

## have i kept you waiting?
months.

## what news?
sir thomas paget is retiring.

## tis surprising, isn't it?
i mean, one sees that's logical.

## what kind of thing would you repeat or report?
nothing said in friendship.

## do you believe that?
why, yes.

## is it in your gift?
effectively.

## what must i do for it?
i know a man who wants to change his woman.

## have you only just noticed?
your friend, our present lord chancellor, now there's an innocent man.

## lnconvenience?
just so.

## this goblet he gave you, how much was it worth?
come along, he gave you a silver goblet.

## how much did you get for it?
fifty shillings.

## it was a gift, wasn't it, from a litigant, a woman?
yes.

## which court was the litigant's case?
court of requests.

## that wasn't too painful, was it?
no.

## yea or nay?
his majesty accepts your resignation very sadly.

## alice?
no.

## shall i, sir?
no, thank you, son roper.

## margaret...... will you?
yes.

## have i your word that what we say here is between us two?
very well.

## and if the king should command you to repeat what i may say?
i should keep my word to you.

## we are at war with the pope.
then what has become of your oath of obedience to the king?

## for the pope's a prince, isn't he?
he is.

## and will you forfeit all you have...... which includes the respect of your country, for a belief?
because what matters is that i believe it, or rather, no...... not that i believe it, but that i believe it.

## i trust i make myself obscure?
perfectly.

## why do you insult me with this lawyer's chatter?
because i'm afraid.

## what side is that?
well, sir, we all know what you think.

## will you stay?
well, sir, that's according.

## why should you?
no, sir thomas, i will not.

## sit by the fire...... and make goslings in the ash?
not at all, alice.

## this english church will divorce him from the queen, then marry him to lady anne.
alice, shall i teach you to read?

## but on any of these matters, have you heard me make a statement?
no.

## on peril of your soul remember, what is your answer?
no.

## would i tell meg what i won't tell you?
meg has your heart.

## but he's silent, master secretary, why not leave him silent?
your grace, not being a man of letters...... you perhaps don't realise the extent of his reputation.

## what kind of pressure do you think you can bring to bear?
i have evidence that sir thomas, while he was a judge, accepted bribes.

## when was there a chancellor whose possessions, after three years...... totalled 100 and a gold chain?
it is, as you imply, common practice...... but a practice may be common and remain an offence.

## did sir thomas accept this cup?
no.

## how?
he gave it to me, your grace.

## why?
a gift.

## when did thomas give you this thing?
i can't exactly remember.

## do you\"remember\"what you did with it?
i sold it.

## where?
a shop.

## has the shop still got it?
no.

## you doubt master rich's word, your grace?
it had occurred to me.

## what's that you say?
the king particularly wishes you to be active in this matter of sir thomas.

## indeed?
he told me.

## look here, cromwell...... what's the purpose of all this?
there you have me.

## cromwell, are you threatening me?
yes.

## the charges?
i understand there are certain charges.

## make a note of that, will you, master rich?
there are no charges.

## you have heard of the so called\"holy maid of kent\"...... who was executed for prophesying against the king?
yes, i met her.

## how was that?
she spoke no treason.

## do you expect me to believe that?
happily, there were witnesses.

## by the bishop of rome, or do you insist on\"pope\"?
no.

## for example, in the church of england...... what exactly is the bishop of rome's authority?
you will find it very ably set out and defended, master secretary...... in the king's book.

## do you deny you instigated it?
it was from first to last the king's own project.

## why not?
because evidence is given on oath, and he will not perjure himself.

## have you anything to say...... regarding the king's marriage with queen anne?
i understood i was not to be asked that again.

## brought?
you've brought yourself to where you stand now.

## what will you do now?
whatever's necessary.

## i followed you.
do you blame them?

## i wish i wasn't, but i am.
were you followed?

## what's to be done then?
give in.

## we're supposed to be the proud ones, the arrogant ones, we've all given in.
and who are you?

## we'il end our friendship now.
why must you stand out?

## for friendship's sake?
yes.

## gripping, is it not?
yes.

## it's their nature?
yes.

## it's why you breed them?
it's so with men.

## and we, his loyal huntsmen, must now drive these subtle foxes from their covert.
is there, in the midst of all this muscle, no sinew that serves no appetite...... of norfolk's, but is just norfolk?

## i couldn't get a boat.
father?

## what is it, meg?
father, there's a new act going through parliament.

## on what compulsion is the oath?
high treason.

## do the words matter?
we know what it means.

## take it?
and if it can be taken, you must take it, too.

## where to this time?
richmond palace.

## have you anything to say?
no.

## seen this document before?
many times.

## will you swear to it?
no.

## will you swear to it?
yes.

## then why won't he swear to the act?
because there is more than that in the act.

## if you're willing to guess that, it should be small matter to guess my objections.
is that what you deny?

## i don't know if the marriage was lawful or not...... but damn it, thomas, look at these names.
then you do have objections to the act?

## so, those of us whose names are there, are damned, sir thomas?
i have no window to look into another man's conscience.

## then the matter is capable of question?
certainly.

## and if it is round, will the king's command flatten it?
no, i will not sign.

## then you have more regard for your own doubt than the king's command?
for myself i have no doubt.

## no doubt of what?
no doubt that i will not take this oath.

## then i am not threatened.
how should i threaten?

## gentlemen, can't i go to bed?
aye.

## why, you have books?
yes.

## may i see my family?
have you ever heard the prisoner speak of the king's divorce, supremacy...

## ... or the king's marriage?
no, not a word.

## secretary?
tomorrow morning, remove the prisoner's books.

## is that necessary?
with regards to this case, the king is becoming impatient.

## for god's sake, they haven't put you in here?
no, sir, a visit.

## is this why they've let you come?
yes.

## how do you plan to do that?
father.

## what is an oath then, but words we say to god?
well, finally it isn't a matter of reason.

## content?
if they'd open a crack that wide, i'd be through it like a bird and back to chelsea.

## and leave you?
it makes no difference.

## will?
yes, sir.

## margaret?
yes.

## you still make a superlative custard, alice.
alice?

## do l?
that's a nice dress you have on.

## master secretary cromwell, have you the charge?
i have, my lord.

## was this no denial?
no, this was silence.

## why have i been called again?
then i'il keep a good grip on it.

## so, sir thomas...... you stand on your silence?
i do.

## what do we hear?
silence.

## what does it betoken, this silence?
nothing.

## if, therefore, you wish to construe what my silence betokened...... you must construe that i consented, not that i denied.
is there a man in this country...... who does not know sir thomas more's opinion of this title?

## do you pretend that is what you wish the world to construe from it?
the world must construe according to its wits.

## now rich, on may 12, you were at the tower?
i was.

## for what purpose?
i was sent to carry away the prisoner's books.

## did you talk with the prisoner?
yes.

## did you talk of the king's supremacy of the church?
yes.

## what did you say?
i said to him, \"supposing there were an act of parliament...

## would not you, master more, take me for king?
that i would, \"he said.

## yes?
then he said, \"but i will put you a higher case.

## parliament has made our king head of the church.
how, if there were an act of parliament, to say that god should not be god?

## well?
and then he said, \"parliament had not the power to do it.

## ls it probable....
do you deny this?

## sir richard, do you wish to modify your testimony?
no, my lord.

## is there anything you wish to take away from it?
no, my lord.

## have you anything to add?
no, my lord.

## to what purpose?
i am a dead man.

## may i see it?
the red dragon.

## what's this?
sir richard is appointed attorney general for wales.

## when i was practising the law, the manner was to ask the prisoner...... before pronouncing sentence, if he had anything to say.
is it necessary?

## have you anything to say?
yes.

## you're very sure of that, sir thomas?
yeah, sometimes.

## want me to fill it up?
i'm not here for the gas.

## can you do something about these dirty windows?

leo can't protect him anymore.

## i guess we both double crossed leo, huh?

oh, yeah?

## hear that, dane?
all business.

## like, where's the shmatte?

## why would i?
this guy is wrong.

## it's easy enough to find out, ain't it?
you find mink, you bring him back here.

## and if he s not there?
i'il sit facing the corner in a funny hat.

## what are you doing tome?
sit still, hymie.

## what?
that's right.

## i don't deserve to die for that.

## getting out the vote?
well, i'il tell you.

## what convinced you of that?
mink took a powder.

## what?
you got a lip on you.

## how do you know mink skipped?
because the dane can't find him.

## meaning what exactly?
maybe nothing.

## so why isn't eddie dane here?
well, he don't care for you, kid.

## aren't we friends anymore?
if you find him, i wanna talk to him alone.

## you understand what i'm saying?
it ain't complicated.

## did you find him?
yeah.

## is he leaving?

## what's he seeing her for?
beats me.

## you know who i am?
yeah, johnny caspar's shadow.

## what, did he stay in bed today?
jesus.

## you're leo's twist, right?
me and leo are through.

## so you re sluttin 'around with tom now, huh?
you get outta here.

## before i go, what's your boyfriend up to?
nothing i know about.

## yeah?
yeah.

## if i tell you, how do i know you won't kill me?
because if you told me and i killed you and you were lying, i wouldn't get to kill you then.

## where's leo?
he's moving around.

## you sure?
check it.

## you know what, yegg?
i believe you.

## how'd you know it was me?
you're the only one i know who'd knock and then break in.

## your other friends wouldn't break in?
my other friends want to kill me, so they wouldn't knock.

## bernie?
things.

## i mean, what am i gonna do?
if i leave, i got nothing.

## bernie ain't so funny anymore?
i guess i made kind of a fool of my self out there... bawling away like a twist.

## you didn't tell anyone about that?
no.

## you didn't shoot me, but  but what have i done for you lately?
don't smart me.

## what were you gonna do if you caught me?
i d just squirt a few, and then you'd let me go again.

## how's the club holding up?
we're managing to squeak by without you.

## got lazarre's money?
no.

## why the hell should i tell you?
the truth is, tad, no reason on earth.

## saturday's fights?
drop johnson put two grand on one yesterday on sailor reese, an under card bum.

i didn't even know he could count.

## you bring them with you?
hello, brian.

## how'd you get the fat lip?
old war wound.

## what were you doing at the club, talking things over with leo?

## hello, drop.
where are your friends when you need 'em, huh?

## how are the katzen jammers?
hello, tom.

## had any visitors?
uhh, no.

## not ever, drop?
not lately.

## seen him since?
one last question, drop.

## that your bet, or, uh... you placing it for a friend?

## when did a feeling return to your head?
you've outgrown that one.

## where you been hiding?
hither and yon.

## is the mayor in?
he's with mr. caspar.

## scare me up some gargle, will you?
sure.

## what's the fireworks?
knocking over one of leo's clubs.

## why would he?
there could be a damn good reason... if you got a fixed fight coming up.

## do you?
maybe.

## the dane know about it?
yeah.

## money?
okay, everybody likes money, but somehow it just don't seem like him.

## huh?
an interesting ethical question.

## yeah?
i got your message.

## a nightmare?
on the contrary.

## you get a kick out of that?
i was in stitches.

## it's mink, isn't it?
i came back.

## can you beat that?
some friend.

## did mink have a. 22?
he already ditched it.

## after he shot rug?
yeah.

## how'd you know?
doesn't matter.

## huh?
no.

## kid, what's the rumpus?
i got news.

## you talked to mink?
yeah, on the phone.

## you sure it was mink?
yeah.

## how do you know?
that ain't all we know, smart guy.

## you thought i'd quit, huh?
uh uh.

## is there a point, or are you just brushing up on your small talk?
i like that.

## is this how you told drop his story?
come here, bum.

## what's the rumpus?
i was just in the neighborhood feeling a little daffy.

## what are you doing?
walking.

## what makes you think that?
that's no answer.

## no one really cares, do they?
his friends didn't really like him.

## what was in it for you?
nothing for me.

## you expect me to believe you?
but before you even think about doing that, you gotta towel down.

## put the razor in cold water, not hot, because metal does what in cold?
i don't know, johnny.

## ain't it the life though?
hello, sal.

## you sure?
you don't look so hot.

## will my cats be all right?
yeah, they'il be fine.

## or didn t you care?
i figured you'd come early looking for blood.

## but if you knew i d come to kill you, how do you know i won't still?
there s nothing init for you now.

## why?
pin this on the dane.

## why did mink shoot rug anyway?
i don't know.

## so you re gonna say the dane did this?
sure.

## funny, ain't it?
mink was terrified the dane'd find out me and him were jungle dup together.

## scratch, huh?
a little bonus.

## why did mink take rug's hair?
beats me.

## fifty fifty on the dough?
or maybe i should get more, since i did the deed.

## why not?
because the dane's already dead halfway across town.

## what the hell are you talking about?
eddie dane is dead.

## what the hell are you talking about?
you took my gun.

## are you crazy?
we're square.

## so what's in it for you?
there's no angle.

## tad?
it's tom.

## a little hooch, whatever?
thanks for coming, tom.

## who's he got in there?
o'doole and the mayor.

## i guess, uh huh?
she's taking the car.

## hell, tom, why didn t you tell me what you were up to?
i thought you d really gone over.

## do you always know why you do things, leo?
sure i do.

## you see?
nothing.

## i know, can you believe that?
we could always test you a third time, rodney.

## what am i supposed to do?
he s afraid of the thing.

## what are you saying, dr. jackson?
it s an 8 symbol address.

## you like it here?
yes sir.

## like what?
now s good.

## wasn t me.
sir, what the hell was that?

## keep my ass from getting blown out of the sky?
the exceptional flying of major john sheppard.

## what say we cut to the part where you start talking real fast?
ah, weir s in here.

## in their  flying city?
yes.

## flying city?
well, uh, keep in mind this is the race that built the stargates  they did everything big.

## um  who knows?
we know the ancients on earth were suffering from a plague.

## but isn t that reason enough to go?
well i ve been choosing members for this expedition for months, dr.

## what?
the z. p. m. he s, uh, he s canadian.

## me?
you re the one who fired that thing at me.

## you mean the drone?
the weapon the ancients built to defend this outpost.

## you do have security clearance to be here?
yeah, yeah, general o neill just gave it to me.

## the what?
jack, you know that gating to another galaxy requires an enormous amount of power.

## you think there are more of these zed things in atlantis?
i said don t touch anything.

## did i do that?
we could be on our way to discovering an entirely new ancient civilization.

## oh, don t you have a dozen or so people already who can use the ancient technology?
yeah, with concentration and training they can make it work.

## really?
this isn t a long trip so i il be as succinct as possible.

## what?
with all due respect, sir, we were just attacked by an alien missile.

## why d you become a pilot?
i think people that don t wanna fly are crazy.

## does anyone else here speak the language these guy's are speaking?
i just need a couple of minutes to finish my work, and you're not helping by standing there.

## we there yet?
we re just waiting on dr. mckay.

## can i have everyone s attention please?
all right, here we go.

## that would be dr. weir, right?
chevron three encoded.

## what is it we re looking at?
switching to zero locks.

## it s structurally in tact?
the climactic sensors say there s oxygen, no measurable toxins ; we have viable life support.

## what does it feel like?
hurts like hell, sir.

## security teams, any alien contact?
negative, sir.

## can you come down and meet me please?
we re three levels down, come in.

## so it might really be the lost city of atlantis?
not much. could travel between the stars, exchanging knowledge and friendship.

## what does that mean?
that if we don t stop everything we re doing right now, we are dead.

## what if it fails completely?
it s a matter of when, not if.

## all right, well how much time do we have?
it s hard to say.

## what about our own power generators?
we re working on that, but with our most advanced naquada power generators, the equations are coming up far short.

## well how do we do that if we can t search the city?
if there were more here, we d be able to detect them.

## can we use the stargate?
there s nowhere near enough power to open a wormhole back to earth.

## everything okay here, sheppard?
yes, sir, just a couple of kids.

## are you here to trade?
trade, yes.

## now how many times have i told you not to play in the forest after dark?
i m just glad you re safe.

## what was that mask you had on?
helps you see in the dark, check it out.

## this?
the wraith.

## can we go there?
afraid not, i come from a galaxy far, far away.

## is that a fact?
well then, we il just uh, we il have to get to know each other.

## will you join us?
i love a good cup of tea.

## who are these wraith?
we have never met anyone who did not know.

## what if the wraith are the enemy the ancient hologram lady is talking about?
all the more reason for us to have a defensible position should we need to abandon atlantis.

## do i?
no.

## then there is something you should see.
you truly cannot return to your world?

## how much further is this place?
not far.

## what s this?
i lost this years ago.

## someone s been busy, huh?
the drawings in the caves are extensive.

## does this represent the destruction of your city?
this drawing far predates that.

## someone knew it was gonna happen?
i believe it happens again, and again.

## where the hell is he?
they are not really there.

## what am i looking for?
there  another part of the force field just failed.

## the city is sacrificing parts of itself in order to maintain these main areas, but catastrophic failure is inevitable.
how are we doing?

## to save it for whom?
survivors from the settlement ; we were attacked.

## what s going on?
we are in no position to help anyone right now.

## what the hell s going on here?
we were about to abandon the city.

## jinto, you have any other address where we can gate to?
yes, many.

## so now could our naquada generators supply enough power to the shield for defensive purposes?
not even close.

## all right, just shut up and listen to me for a moment, all right?
come on, what do we know about the wraith.

## why?
i don t need to answer your question  because the people in charge didn t consider the ramifications before they reacted.

## how am i supposed to react?
and we re defenseless, you said so yourself.

## how do you know going off on some half assed rescue mission isn t going to bring them all right back here to our doorstep?
maybe it will, but it s the right thing to do.

## why?
because it is.

## do you know what that means?
it s just a matter of time before the wraith figure out that this is the base of our operations.

## we weren t there for more than a few hours before they showed up.
i mean who knows?

## and that one of these people you brought back here with you tipped them off?
it s possible.

## any idea what to expect?
no.

## how do i know he s not the one who told them?
someone comes.

## we re the ones you re after, right?
i m their leader.

## wait, what was that?
rotate the camera.

## you re sure this is the right address?
it s the only one we could get a lock on.

## dr. beckett, what was it you wanted me to see?
these cells have none of the normal human inhibiting proteins whatsoever.

## i say that anything he saw was caused by a residual command language in the severed nerve endings.
what about the movement major sheppard saw?

## very, very old.
all right, anything else?

## i don t blame ya.
how old?

## what is that noise?
i...

## ready?
i have no idea.

## a little puddle jumper like this?
it s a ship, it goes through the gate.

## i thought we were going with gate ship?
negative, flight.

## did you do that?
i was just wondering where we go from here.

## so how do we find them once we land?
well i ve been thinking about that too.

## is my son alive?
he s well and waiting for you.

## where s colonel sumner?
he was taken by the wraith.

## how about when?
not long.

## how  bout a diversion a little bit?
we re gonna need to make some noise out there.

## rig up the c4 to blow a hole and get these people out of here on my signal, all right?
i can find the colonel with this, there aren t that many wraith around.

## what do you call yourself?
colonel marshall sumner, united states marine corps.

## is it valor or ignorance?
we traveled through the stargate as peaceful explorers.

## feeding ground?
all living things must eat.

## why do you care?
hunger  is distasteful.

## what do you call your world?
earth.

## more?
our feeding ground has not been so rich in ten thousand years.

## is that the kind of treatment i can expect for myself and my people?
as i have said, all living things must eat.

## where is this new feeding ground?
i won t...

## how s the hand feeling?
much better.

## how did this come to you?
i don t remember.

## how d you find me?
tread marks, standard issue.

## how many are left?
sir, we need to leave.

## colonel sumner?
we are well enough.

## what can we do?
we re safe as long as they can t see us.

## then how can we get through?
we have to draw them away from the gate and double back.

## you see anything like a weapons console over there?
try and go invisible again.

## do we have an identification code?
nothing yet.

## no?
look around you.

## how come i never make friends like that?
you need to get out more.

## is there lemon in this?
one more thing major.

## well you are the ranking military officer now, or do you need to be reminded of that?
we need to get back out there ; do what we came to do.

## is there a possibility... that all potentials exist side by side?
have you ever seen yourself through the eyes of someone else that you have become...

## what is reality?
i think the more you look at quantum physics... the more mysterious and wondrous it becomes.

## have you ever thought about what thoughts are made of?
every age, every generation has its built in assumptions

## is everyone an enigma?
they most certainly are.

## isn't it amazing that we have options and potentials that exist... but we're unaware of them?
we've been conditioned to believe... that the external world is more real than the internal world.

## what is reality?
no.

## did you know that the brain imprints what it has the ability to see?
this is important.

## so is it possible our eyes, our cameras... see more than what our brain... has the ability to consciously project?
well, the way our brain is wired up... we only see what we believe is possible.

## you okay?
i heard you scream earlier.

## was it another dream?
you were an indian... watching columbus's ship materialize out of thin air.

## my pills are fine, okay?

## what's the big deal?
you say, \"look right in the chamber.

## and yet, there's this completely amazing magic... sitting right in front of your eyes.
oh, well, what does that really mean?

## is this then the observer?
in my modeling, the observer is the spirit... inside the four layer biobodysuit.

## there's no photographer.
where the hell are you?

## or a hot date?
well, the chief of police went on television saying that...

## this leads naturally to wonder do people are people affecting the world of reality that they see?
you betcha they are.

## but hurry, will ya, please?
because these models are giving me a headache.

## makes you wonder, doesn't it?
if thoughts can do that to water... imagine what our thoughts can do to us.

## if you accept with every rudiment of your being... that you will walk on water, will it happen?
yes, it will.

## you see how we are extending the image of ourselves?
sucked.

## me?
the day i make someone sane, they're in trouble.

## it makes you wonder, doesn't it?
if thoughts can do that to water... imagine what our thoughts can do to us.

## is there a substance of thought?
i guess itjust depends on what you think is real.

## guilty.
are all realities in the quantum field existing simultaneously?

## this is a good assignment, if you'd see it that way.
a wedding?

## what's to see?
i do. \"they did.

## does that mean emotions are good or emotions are bad?
no, emotions are designed so that it reinforces chemically... something into long term memory.

## what is it?
mixed.

## got any tips?
you won't do anything, so i will.

## what are you standing there for?
get out and serve.

## so how can anyone really say they're in love with a specific person... for example?
they're only in love with the anticipation... of the emotions they're addicted to.

oh, yeah.

no.

## what's wrong with that?
no children to grow up unhappy, nobody gets hurt except maybe me.

## who said so?
a book i read.

## what book?
i sent for a book.

## a plain wrapper?
yeah, a plain wrap...

## norman, you know what?
i sent for a book just like that in the same plain wrapper...... general delivery.

## the same one?
and i read every word of it, and i think most of it's mid victorian nonsense.

## hey, want to trade books?
no.

## are you suggesting that...?
norman, don't get me wrong.

## why not?
well, my mother.

## what?
you can start with me.

well, it makes time pass.

## will you come?
i think i'd like that.

## betty?
hello, betty.

## who?
allison mackenzie.

## after the dance, shall we go to rockland?
okay.

## some more, mrs. mackenzie?

## do you mind?
no, not if you promised it to her.

## well, i'il see you around, okay?
okay.

## did you see your mother dancing with mr. rossi?
i've never seen my mother dance.

## they do?

## where are we going?
you'il see.

## where are we going?

oh, yes, yes.

## you want to make love to me?
yes, yes, of course i want to.

## do you work at night?
yes, quite often.

i didn't mean to sound like the dedicated idealist.

## including the dancing?
including.

## you mean now?
sure.

## but what about college and law school that you've always talked about?
that's just a dream.

## whose father does?
not everyone in college is a millionaire's son.

## what difference does it make?
it's what you wanna do in life.

## joey?
i thought you was something out of a dream.

## where's ma and joey?
let's have a drink, celebrate your growing up.

## where's ma and joey?
they're working at a party at harrington's.

yes, i read them.

## when did you write them?
all summer.

## has anybody else seen them?
only selena.

## are they good enough to send to a magazine?

## allison, is that how peyton place really looks to you?
they were only fiction.

## now, where do you go from here?
that's what i hoped to find out from you.

## why not?
because i don't want to study about writing.

## aren't all newspapermen?
that's a myth.

## when do i start?
all i want is a chance to show what i can do.

## who's the father?
i won't tell you.

## now, what kind of rot is that?
you're not the first girl in the world...... who had to get married.

## ted carter?
no.

## what do you mean by\"help\"?
i don't want to have the baby.

## what you're asking me to do is break the law of man and god.

selena, tell me who he is.

## i've got selena in my office.
who is he?

## what for?
she's pregnant.

## hey, doc....
are you out of your mind?

## you know i couldn't do nothing as awful as that, don't you?
i'm going back to my office.

## if i sign it, what are you gonna do with it?
i'il lock it up in my safe.

## you want to ruin a girl's life for one word?
no, but falsifying records....

## understand?
no, i won't.

## how about that?
that's just fine.

## selena's all right now, isn't she?
she'il be back to the store tomorrow.

## how are you?

## where'd you come from?
back there.

## what are you doing out here by yourself?

okay.

## okay?

## what?
allison and norman on their way to crystal pond to swim, all by themselves.

## so what?
they're young, happy, maybe in love.

## what trouble can they get into?
if you don't understand, i'm not going to explain.

## why not?
your father said to give you a big sendoff.

## can't you guess?
seeing is believing.

## know what you're doing to my temperature?
let's cool it off and go for a swim.

## you all ready, norman?

## where?
they're gone now.

## naked?
naked.

## betty, do you know how much i like you?
i remember, faintly.

## only having the friends that he picks out for you...... wearing what he tells you to wear, thinking his thoughts?
betty, i'm old enough, but he's a tough man to handle.

## yeah, but how?
i have a selfish idea.

## wouldn't that just bowl him over?
i'm sure it would.

## what good is life if i know i didn't have the guts to live it my way?
rodney.

## how about tomorrow, for instance?
i can't remember when i've had so much fun.

## just like that?

## what do you call a man who thinks about nothing but...?
human.

## or in my home?
i'm not gonna let you make this dirty.

## what do you call it?

## don't you understand?
no.

## if you were gonna get married, why didn't you tell me?
you wouldn't have approved.

## well, what was it?
i'd like to talk with you alone.

## rodney...... what about college?
i'm not going.

## why don't you get dressed and go for a walk?
you haven't spoken to me for over a week, since....

## what'il you do for money?
i have enough to get there.

## could you elaborate?
a few months ago, i noticed something unusual.

## but that wasn't the case, was it?
no.

## is that right?
no.

## marshall?
he's our tech guy.

## after the cla reviews the mission, what happens then?
i meet vaughn to get my countermission.

sd 6 sends me to moscow to get computer disks.

## are those the files?
if they are, cough.

## your sd 6 partner?
dixon.

## he doesn't know you're a double?
that's right.

## does that ever cause problems?
sd 6 sent us to retrieve a vaccine from a plant in badenweiler and destroy the empty building.

how often does sd 6 send you on operations?

## what is their priority?
at the moment, it's rambaldi.

## what can you tell me about him?
milo rambaldi was pope alexander vl's chief architect.

## why?
they assume that rambaldi had some sort of master plan, which was recently confirmed following my trip to argentina.

## you're not gonna let me go, are you?
we're done for today.

## what the hell are you doing?
proving this prophecy is not about you.

## dad?
hey, honey.

## what if he was talking about me?
then everything's predetermined.

## are you all right?
you didn't think about it, not once, the possibility that rambaldi could be right about me.

## why not?
i believe in you.

## did you think i'd just throw anyone in my trunk?
i just checked with transportation.

## why doesn't the guy just give up?
it's not like he can escape.

## sydney, where are you?
i need to see you now.

## what happened to you?
we'd like the warheads you've acquired.

## when?
just now.

## you've confirmed this?
yes.

## what just happened?
it's over.

## can we tell if there's survivors?
not with this bird.

## you sure she can breathe in there?
dad, we need to get moving.

## what are we doing here?
this is not the drop.

## the filter got clogged, didn't it?
we're still 10 miles away from the base.

## and assume no new mines?
i just spent five hours in a grain bin.

## is everything in place?
the nuclear cores will be activated at 1700 hours.

## this is about money?
everything is about money.

## where did the prf get all these mines?
you americans have the worst inventory controls in the world.

## so, sydney, how's school?
i'm writing my dissertation.

## are you hurt?
no.

## why?
the indians found out the rebels have acquired nukes.

## go?
i'il have a military aircraft waiting.

## are you trying to get rid of me?
clear.

## so check the vault first?
not if we only get one shot.

## know what this place was when i was here, jack?
a prison.

## why do you think i learned the sewage tunnels or memorized the mine locations?
so i could escape, you idiot.

## any idea on the men with her?
no, but the blackmailer wants $ 100 million in bearer bonds for her return.

## who else knew about your instructions to kill emily?
only the people in this room.

## you believe one of us may be behind this?
no.

## where's your mother?
i haven't seen her.

rambaldi experimented with self sustaining cell regeneration.

## can't this thing go faster?
this is it.

## agent bristow, do you have the package?
we're in process.

## air strikes?
we're not finished.

## that's what this is all about?
we need to get the cores and get out of here.

preliminary analysis indicates that it's anywhere from 400 to 600 years old.

## what's this?

## how long do you think it'il last?
could be a while.

## you know any jokes?
well, i was going to use phil.

## marshall?

## do you remember that little poor red assed baboon when he was, like, turned inside out?
thank you, marshall.

## i trust this one won't be too much of a stretch, hmmm, for either of you?
we should talk.

## where's the judge?
a select penalty jury was empanelled early this morning and the decision was predictably swift.

## how the hell did i become the person who's trying to save her?
that doesn't mean that you have to be her best friend.

## how are you?
oh, i got my, uh, thirty days sobriety chip.

## oh, by the way, you know anybody who wants a car?
i'm hocking mine.

## you're selling your car?
yeah, well, it's either that or i quit paying my student loans.

## why are you cleaning like this?
you're acting like howard hughes.

## give me just a second?
okay, i told him i'd give him a couple bucks if he just handed out some fliers, got the word out.

## hamburgers aren't on the menu, are they?
garden burger.

## how much are you paying that guy?
twelve bucks an hour.

## remember the rumour going around the agency around the cold war about the soviets raising sleeper agents as americans?
now, i know it sounds potentially paranoid, but this is how they would do it if they managed to get their test in circulation here.

## what maneuver would that be?
pleading guilty, accepting the death penalty.

## because she was struck by a crisis of conscience?
i think she knew the verdict was a foregone conclusion.

## how'd you get that?
i spent a decade with this woman and another twenty years analyzing how she could have deceived me for so long.

## you know what else i think?
you can't honestly believe that.

## it's true, isn't it?
if mom hadn't fooled you, if you hadn't been so gullible, i never would have been born.

## is everything all right?
okay, look, i don't i don't know how to say this other than to just say it.

## you know anybody who wants to buy a car?

## what?
a hearing has been scheduled with the joint intelligence committee.

## yes?
i'il send her down right now.

## you asked to see me?
agent bristow, i'm doctor nicholas.

## what's going on?
five weeks ago you infiltrated one of your mother's labratories in taipei where you discovered a rambaldi device.

## how long were you in proximity to the device?
i... it took me about a minute to rig it with explosives.

## will someone please tell me what's going on?
we believe the device is the source of the virus that infected the men in geneva.

## did you close your eyes at all?
don't frost the pie! \"it seemed really important.

## you think we're sick?
i don't know.

## vaughn, can i tell you something?
agent bristow, your tests came back negative for antibodies, you're free to go.

## what was the sign?
hemorrhaging from the fingernails.

## is that how you justify lying to your superiors, endangering other agents?
yes.

## why this sudden change of heart?
deferentially, senator, my reasons are my own.

my daughter convinced me that i acted unethically.

a future.

## wanna know what i do?
i found them in there, with the hacksaws.

## just out of curiosity, what did you do in that motel room?
you got out of there pretty fast.

## why did you deem it necessary to page me when you knew i was at home?
i didn't know if you were gonna make it.

no.

## hello?
it's for you.

i had everything in order.

## sweetheart, are you okay?
mommy just needs you to be really strong right now.

## is he well?
come outside.

## what is that?
the whole city is here.

## excuse.
rodney?

## where was i?
filho...

## why?
because my mother was a communist... my father was a socialist and my uncle was a trade unionist.

## remember how the mayor gave us rollerskates?
skates.

## i said to my mother, \"shall i stay or shall i go?
she asked what i wanted, i wanted to go.

## where were all the parents?
on board the sontai we crossed the north sea... and into the baltic sea to leningrad.

## and we replied\"familia?
bilbao\".

## how could i shower with the boys?
in brief, it was a disaster.

## do you understand?
so after the shower they dressed us in a sailor suit.

## what would i call it...?
we had a bite to eat.

## curious, isnt it?
at bedtime, i always went to kiss my brothers goodnight.

## do you see children?
that is the right way.

## where is the girl i have fallen in love with?
this is the street, this is the house... this is the girl i have fallen in love with.

## who doesnt want to eat like cervantes?
every wednesday cervantes ate chichivicha\", lentils.

## most of the bombs were incendiary, right?
yes, then i climbed upon the roof... and watched the sky fill with tracers.

## the people left them there.
the germans had surrounded us, we had to lend a hand, didn\"t we?

## understand?
and then you would see one of those small children sleighs... with a mummy covered in bed sheets... you had to take them to the cemetery.

## did you know that?
the russians built a railway over the frozen lagoda river... to supply leningrad.

## what did we eat on the way?
boiling hot water, bread or things like that.

## but, that\"s children for you, isn\"t it?
it was really hard because we had no food.

## how do i justify that?
but when you\"re young everything seems so much easier.

## you see?
that night, everything went perfectly.

## can you imagine?
the war was over.

## absurd, isn\"t it?
doctors and teachers, we always had very low wages, very low.

## he said, \"what are you studying?
i said\"history.

## we worked and they educated us, no?
stalin, yes, we love stalin.

## also, she was used to living alone.
he said, \"we have human rights laws, and you won\"t let them go home?

## and suddenly... how many were we?
six of us appear in her house, being noisy, and with two kids.

## what did i expect after 20 years?
i could see that woman was my mother, but that was all.

## what?
she was a bad mother in law to your wife.

## what would\"ve become of you, of us, if we hadn\"t gone to russia?
if we\"d stayed in spain, it wouldve been a disaster.

## did you say a gentleman?
well...

## how could he arrive?
they were blown skyhigh.

## what else could we do?
i was going to get married, they had to teach me how.

## do you take tonia as your wife?
of course\".

## do you remember?
that priest was francos confessor.

## heres the book so you can start studying.
really?

## study?
he didnt know my husband.

## you dont believe?
no.

## i said, \"who told you that?
she said, \"the priest.

## i said\"what?
give me the names of your friends\".

## he asked me, \"are you a believer?
i said i was not.

## and i said, \"what services?
most of the war children... were working for the soviet military industry... mainly in the secret aircraft and rocket factories.

## why should i tell you?
what i know and what i have been... was given to me by people i will not betray.

## what do you want?
in their filthy manner.

## and if they hadn\"t evacuated us?
i don\"t know.

## would many of us have perished under the bombs?
i see my family and nobody died under a bomb.

## right?
in the ussryou were spanish.

## how much further do you suppose, doc?
three days on this washboard and that volcano looks as far away as it ever did.

## for my information, hank, how did you get permission so fast?
from my group, i mean.

## truly, isn't it?
if these estimates are right, this quake may be as severe as mount pele...... vesuvius, san francisco.

## how far you come, fellas?
mexico city.

## where do you want to go?
san lorenzo.

## do you know?
who knows how the bridges are.

## who knows?
the telephone lines are down since the earthquake.

## what the devil was that?
i don't know.

## anybody home?
i'il see if i can find a well.

## what do you make of it?
it must be that patrol car those telephone men saw...... but i certainly have no idea what could have happened or why.

## you don't suppose they're trying to walk to san lorenzo?
511.

## sergeant vega, do you read me?
this is headquarters calling 511.

## hello, do you read me?
511, i read you, sergeant vega.

## sergeant vega?
here, you better take this.

## where's sergeant vega?
he's not here.

## did the car run off the road?
no.

## didn't the sergeant make a report after the accident?
the radio's working.

## you've had practice, mr. scott?
i guess so, with four brothers and two sisters.

## that police car out there?
it could've been a bull.

## you did notice the beans were still hot on the stove?
yep.

## so?
when i've already got a dozen questions i can't answer...... i try to ignore any new ones.

## do you think we ought to radio them about the kid?
nope, i think we ought to get to san lorenzo as quick as we can.

## hello?
we only found sergeant vega and the baby.

## at what?
we wish we knew too.

## is the mayor here?
they weren't there.

## can i offer you what hospitality the village may provide?
thank you, father.

## then this isn't the first time?
the first sunday after the eruption...... various of the congregation were not in church.

## father, what about that story about the demon bull?
that seems like a strange superstition.

## has miraflores been attacked also?
cattle had been found dead in various areas of the ranch.

## shall we try around over that side, or over here?
neither one of them looks exactly like a pan american highway.

## you see a trail up around those rocks?
i don't know about that, but i've found something a lot more interesting.

## so?
s, s, seor.

## gently, now.
horse?

## no sharp pains?
no, really, i'm all right.

## how about the horse?
i saw him gallop off.

## do you happen to have a canteen?
oh, sure.

## oh, is that good?
i'il say it is.

## could i ask another favor of you?
well, sure.

## would you mind taking me back to san lorenzo?
be glad to.

## how are things in san lorenzo?
oh, so so.

## is that any reason to act like frightened children?
i don't think it's just a poisonous plant, seorita.

## then we'il meet later?
right.

## if your patron, my father, were alive today...... would you be frightened of sounds in the night and run like children to the village?
seorita teresa, i understand you need us.

## where is he?
in the laboratory with dr. delacruz.

## laboratory?
you'd be surprised at the experiments that go on there.

## where is it?
this way.

## doctor, is that the patrolman?
yes, sergeant vega...... who lived doing his duty and who may perform a greater one now.

## well?
looked like subcutaneous cells that had just burst or run rampant.

## you think it is a poison, then?
i do.

## not a chemical poison, doctor?
no, but i believe for many reasons that this is an organic poison.

## who doesn't, doctor?
well, as you say, if it's an organic poison...... anything from nature, the great velasco will identify it.

## what other reasons?
well, there was only one wound.

## footprints?
you are amazed.

## well, the alcohol, the distilled water, the salt solution, i can understand that...... but what's the tequila for?
well, in your country, i believe you call it a coffee break.

## why put on such a face?
we will do it if i have to stay in the saddle without sleep myself.

## pio, don't you understand?
can't you see the cattle know that something evil is carried in the wind.

## would you like some brandy, sir?
yes, thank you.

## would you like some too?
please.

## may i make a complaint, teresa?
oh, i'm sorry.

## what was not done suitably?
well, that's just it.

## well, is that so bad?
that all depends.

## see anything?
hold it up against the light.

## do you like to keep scorpions?
i know a place where there are millions.

## why don't we?
oh, excuse me, the line's been fixed.

## hacienda miraflores?
just testing the line.

## oh, is the line all fixed?
all clear, ma'am.

## get to the truck.
hello, what's wrong?

## where's the arroyo bridge?
i'il show you.

## pancho, what's happening to you tonight?
keep quiet.

## what's wrong with the cattle, pio?
i cannot say.

## where is juanito?
he's safe.

## where is the laboratory?
it's over there.

## what can we do?
i emptied the machine gun at one of them.

## what weapon do you intend to use?
gas.

## is that all of them, lieutenant?
i want to do what i can too.

## see if you can find my boots for me, will you?
i know where they are.

## you kind of like those, huh?
tell you what, juanito...... when you get to be a big man, i'il get you a pair just like these.

## you like that, huh?
i know how to ride very good.

## a half a man\"?
oh, juanito, you know sometimes even a half a man...... has a lot of different jobs to do.

## you be very careful and don't get hurt, won't you?
don't worry, i promise.

## how deep do you say it is?
doc and i have been down many a cave...... but there's no way of really telling until you actually hit bottom.

## what do you say, doc?
right.

## will that poisonous gas work in a crevice this big?
i could not anticipate such a void as this.

## you want my men to go down there?
it's suicide.

## what are you doing here?
i'm a stowaway.

## juanito, do me a favor, will you, and just stay out of the way?
yes, mr. hank.

## and just sit in the jeep like a big boy, okay?
put these in the cage.

## why the birds, professor?
if the birds stop singing, that means there's poison gas in the cave.

## whose responsibility is it?
the police, the army, the people who live here.

## why did you do that?
maybe i just wanted to see what you'd do.

## what did i do?
you did all right.

## hank, are you all right?
it's the head of a scorpion in the wall.

## can you see any signs of mendoza?
no, not from here.

## are you there, hank?
hank, answer.

## are you there, hank?
dr. ramos.

## what are you doing down here?
i came to help you.

## are you there, dr. ramos?
hank, answer me.

## what happened to hank?
hank and juanito are down there.

## oh, juanito, why did you do it?
i tried to help them.

## you couldn't use the gas?
no, we lost it in the molten lava.

## can't we close and seal that opening with dynamite?
you have no idea as to the size of that place.

## but suppose they find another way?
those passages down there.

## ready?
let her go.

## you'il be in mexico city for a week first?
yes.

## oh, but even if we do have, what, a day, two days...?
i don't want to settle for just two days, hank.

## how are you, sir?
well, we're just getting started, finally.

## everything is under control, isn't it?
there's no cause for alarm, not at all.

## oh, a plane?
yeah, sure, that would help a lot.

## oh, dr. velasco, do you suppose there'd be room for three on that plane?
of course there will.

## did he suspect?
no, i don't think so.

## what have you got against marriage?
i try to remember what my father told me one time.

## yes?
i am victor esteban.

## but what about seorita alvarez?
i have orders to take her wherever she wishes.

## now you're convinced our fears are justified?
this scorpion may be one that...

## exactly where is this area where it was photographed?
southwest of the volcano.

## what is that long arm there?
that is a cavern which extends southward to within 20 miles of mexico city...... there, where it lies under the railroad.

## and when will they decide to come to the surface after blood?
so that is why we brought you here.

## how powerful?
the throat.

## can you duplicate the poison?
nope.

## hank, what's the meeting on friday about?
oh, some geophysical conference dr. velasco roped us in on.

## cigarette?
not right now.

## after you finish that, where am i taking you for dinner?
hank, it's only 9:00.

## do you realize this is mexico city?
and no one has dinner before 11:00 at night.

## aren't you overdoing it a bit, hank?
well, i've gotta make an impression on you in 48 hours that'il last for two months.

## don't you like caviar?
oh, i love it, but i must say i could never understand why it's so expensive.

## what can we do?
you can help us soon enough.

## where is the scorpion?
we lost it in the hills 10 miles out of town.

## with what kind of weapon?
i hope it is a weapon.

## yes?
don't tell me i forgot them.

## how are you doing?
it's so good to see you again.

## what's new?
doing the whole single mom routine.

## are you taking pictures these days?
no.

## hey, you think your chair seems right for that space?
you said you were kidding about me not bringing my ugly ass furniture.

## what?
i thought we were gonna be more casual about this.

## everything?
how they look so perfect.

## what do you mean?
i mean, i'm having a child... with the last person in the world who would ever want a child.

## why aren't you wearing your casts?
i take them off.

## see?
your left foot looks purple.

## okay, it's time to get this show on the road, yeah?
i guess i could call a taxi...

## so you want a traditional thai buddhist service?
if that's a problem, we can go somewhere else.

## i assume the deceased will remain at the temple for three days... before we have the service here?
the buddha, the altar, the carpet kneelers.

## but how do we know you're safe here?
you could be hurt by these ruffians.

## are you gonna be able to do it?
yeah, sure, of course.

## what about dinner?
you probably don't have any food.

## why?
because, if you aren't, things come up... and you've no idea how big the thing's gonna be.

i just dropped by to see if father o'malley could play a little golf this afternoon.

## where's your parish?
right over here, st. francis.

## father, why don't you come with us?
it's a grand game.

## you mind if i use that one sometime, father?
young man, would you mind...

## how did he ever become a priest?
well, i don't...

## who is it?
mrs. quimp.

## does he know what?
that you're in charge.

## how'd you know?
i didn't.

## what's this i hear about a pasture?
i was just saying to him, father... the next time i come past your church i'm going to drop in and see you.

## would you mind the puppies?
thank you.

## you've heard about the mortgage?
all churches have mortgages.

## you were?
as you know, i represent... the knickerbocker savings and loan company.

## is she very far in arrears?
mrs. quimp has paid us nothing for six months.

## supposing the poor old woman has no place to go?
the knickerbocker savings and loan company is not a charitable institution...

## but i'm not in your business, see?
if i haven't got anything and don't want anything, i'm a bum.

## st. dominic's?
i can see you haven't been around long.

## your father holds the mortgage?
you're darn right he does.

## can you imagine it?
he's a very disliked man.

## junior?
it's turkeys.

## ain't it, herman?
yeah.

## now, where may i ask did you get it?
we got...

## isn't that great?
but, surely, your mother...

## she don't?
honest.

## so you guaranteed mrs. quimp's rent?
of course.

## hot?
of course it's hot.

## what about him?
this afternoon...

## they don't?
no.

## who told you that?
the police.

## is that so?
tony scaponi was one of them.

## would you like to go out and see the games with me?
st. louis is my old hometown, you know.

## what do you say?
well, i guess so.

## i'il meet you here saturday at noon?
that'd be good.

## let me see now, where was i?
oh, yeah, i know.

## what made me become a priest?
no.

## what was it the police accused him of?
stealing.

## stealing what?
turkeys.

## did the poor man get his turkeys back?
all but one, father.

## mccarthy, how are you?
good morning, father.

## you open for business?
always open for business, mccarthy.

## yeah?
seems like it's more yours than mine.

## her?
mrs. quimp.

## do you follow me, father?
yes.

## you follow me, father?
yeah.

## you follow me, father?
i follow you.

## carol, suppose you give us your version of it?
i guess it's just about like he said.

## you don't get along with your parents?
no.

## so you're going to leave home?
i've left.

## how are you fixed for funds?
i haven't any.

## why don't you go back home?
i tell you, at home my life is intolerable.

## parents?
we don't agree on anything.

## do you think it's too short?
well, i don't know.

## if they do let me go out, they say, \"where are you going?
come home early.

## are you?
sometimes.

## did you ever think of maybe having the boyfriends over to the house?
now you talk like they do.

## she does?
by 9:00 we have to be off the couch.

## can you imagine?
of course, you know, there might be two sides to it.

## as old as that?
when i was 1 8, i thought my father was pretty dumb.

## now that you're in new york, what do you propose to do?
i'm going to get a job.

## you any good?
of course i'm good.

## what makes you think so?
well, i...

## would you sing something for me?
maybe i can help you.

## what do you think?
you got a pretty nice voice, but instead of so much of this... you ought to think about putting a little feeling into the words.

## i see what you mean, father.
for instance, father?

## supposing you try it then?
i was imitating you, father.

## did i do that?
hello, father.

## what would you think of a little general housework?
mrs. scaponi, with all those children, 11, no, 1 2, in october.

## aren't you?
well, now...

## and where, may i ask, are you expecting to find employment?
in some nice cool, airy nightclub, i suppose.

## any prospects?
no.

## you have a home, i presume?
no, she just left it, father.

## do you think you could let me have 1 0?
of what? $ 1 0.

## how about $5?
no, $ 1 0.

## after all, you are 1 8, aren't you?
don't worry.

## cause i promised o'malley, that's what for.
what are we doing hanging around here for?

## cause i said so, see?
hey, fellas, look.

## look, you, o'malley's a right guy, see?
pick him up.

## he didn't rat on us about the turkeys, did he?
no.

## took us to a baseball game?
yeah.

## bought us hot dogs, didn't he?
yeah.

## how do we know?
hello, father.

## where'd you get the outfit?
it's the st. louis browns.

## wanna see me?
just a minute.

## well, father, so you won't have no beef coming, i'm laying it on the line, okay?
okay.

## they did?
yeah, they figured being a priest... you were gonna slip them the old routine.

## only, the way it is now, i'm on the hook for you, see?
i'm responsible for you.

## get me?
i won't let you down.

## can i talk to them now?
sure, go ahead.

## you gonna give me a break?
father, that depends.

## how many of you here know three blind mice?
i know it.

## any more?
come on, you all know it.

## everybody knows it?
sure.

## herman?
he's pouting.

## you want him?
certainly, tony.

## keep quiet, will you, please?
don't hit me on the head.

## i don't know how to sing...

## now, keep quiet, okay?

## got that?
let me hear it now.

## you got that?

## what's your name?
elmer.

## elmer, your voice is changing, isn't it?
i guess so, father.

## got that?
elmer, you sing like you're made for this section.

## what did you sing?
sit down, tony.

## you got your notes?
we hit them all together and we got a nice chord.

## ready?
everybody take a deep breath now.

## ready?
here's your note now.

## want to call it a day?
there's still enough light outside for some baseball.

## you saw the bishop, father?
yeah.

## you wanted to see me, father?
yes, so i did.

## oh, you have?
and i want to be frank with you.

## what did the bishop say?
after a little talk, he congratulated me... on me 45 years at st. dominic's.

## then what happened?
that was all.

## father, why can't we go along just as we have been?
no.

## i mean, now?
nothing.

## when you and the bishop had your little talk... it was more or less along those lines, wasn't it?
yes.

## he didn't look well, did he, when he came in this evening?
go see if he's awake.

## where would he go?
i can't imagine.

## okay, sure, but keep at it, will you?
no, you can't miss him.

## look, father, take it easy, will you?
you better go home.

## shall i make some coffee?
no, thank you.

## now what's the matter?
if you don't mind it, i'd rather go in by myself.

## do you have a wee drop of the\"crature\"about?
matter of fact, i might have a little one with you.

## a bit of old ireland?
yes.

## what about your mother?
i don't remember much about her.

## don't forget we got a rehearsal in the morning.

## let's try just for once to finish together?
all right, tommy, i promise.

## chuck\"?

## why did you stop writing?

## where's your parish, father?
i'm over here at st. dominic's, about 1 0 blocks from here.

## tim o'dowd?

well, i'il have to be running along.

## tommy, he can stand in the wings, can't he?
it would be a privilege.

## you wanted to see me, father?
yeah.

## what is it?
suppose you tell father o'malley in your own words.

## young haines was ready to throw me out without so much as a\"how do you do?
but when it comes to this young lady... and mark you, there are other words i could call her... he acts quite different.

## don't you think it's strange?
that's a question.

## the nose on whose face, father?
it doesn't matter whose face it's on.

## very nice here, isn't it?
very nice.

## you mean it's all in my mind?
that's right.

## won't you sit down?
ted haines, jr.

## and what do you think his approach was?
you tell him.

## his exact words were, \"hey, good looking, what's cooking?
now wait a minute.

## what i really said was, \"who do you know that i know?
you know, that's worse.

## who knows?
it might have worked.

## junior?
right.

## anyway, what's wrong with that?
nothing that i know of, up to here.

## like mrs. quimp?

no.

## where'd you get that wicked left hand?
well, i've always been interested in music.

## regrets?
no.

## or would you rather i change the subject?

## what's your analysis so far?
have you...

that's right.

## or rather, what was he?
a police officer.

## i have to go make a phone call.
what was he?

## what was he?
i didn't really know the man.

## you know why?
everyone knows it's pointless to confront the police.

## what's that got to do with it?
everything.

## who eliminated nyman?
someone he had given a hard time.

## you mean it's a person from nyman's past?
only his name has probably been filed in one of our wastebaskets...

## want to grab a cup of coffee?
i'il stick to tea instead.

## did you know nyman?
yes, indeed.

## when was that?
\"the vile man from sffle\".

## want to know how its done?
you start out by cutting its tongue out.

## know what you do?
no...

## you were a paratrooper, right?
no, that's going too far.

## then wouldn't he have been reported several times?
you know where those complaints are filed, in the wastebasket.

## what about a higher authority?
aren't you naive...

## you left, what do we do now?
we've got loads to do.

## ls that all right with you?
sure...

## why did they call him that?
the vile man from sffle\".

## lsn't this your day off?
i usually wear my uniform.

## so, why are you here?
stig nyman's dead.

## you knew that already?
no, but it was in the cards.

## did you know stig?
not very well.

## what do you think of him?
he was a very good man.

## stig nyman taught you the ropes?
sure, he taught me a lot.

## like how to commit perjury?
how to copy each other's reports, even if every single word is a lie.

## ls that what he taught you?
i've never heard of those things.

## never knocked down schoolchildren?
it never happened.

## know what i think about?
i think about my 30 years on the force.

## who hated nyman that badly?
no one...

## will that be all, or should we go further back in time?
no, this will be fine.

## has rnn come back to the office yet?
oh, he hasn't...

## could we talk about something else?
you look perky.

## what's up?
20 complaints during the past few years.

## and maybe even a massage?
i won't lie to you, i had a massage.

## it's worth a try, isn't it?
right...

## why don't we check out ten names each?
oh...

## mrs nyman, is it correct that only you, your son, and your husband's two brothers knew which room he was in?
that's correct.

## she told him which hospital it was.
ls hult in?

## i wonder why he called?
maybe he wanted to send flowers.

## why would he call at night?
at this time of the year, any time after 5:30 pm is night.

## did you watch tv last night?
that's right, you were on duty...

## could you find out what time\"baretta\"was broadcast?
9:25 pm.

## do you think hult stabbed nyman?
i would like to discuss that call with him, though.

## as what?
that's my name.

## what do mean?
that it's strange that hult calls nyman's wife and introduces himself as\"palmon harold hult\".

## how do you know his name?
you wrote it down on your pad.

## what?
it's also listed in the complaint ke eriksson lodged.

## how can i help you this time?
it's about that telephone call.

## did you recognize his voice?
no, i don't know the man.

## wouldn't it be simpler if you talked to sergeant hult?

## how long has she been taking birth control pills before this pregnancy?
thirty one months.

## you realize... that i came from the east specifically for this matter?

absolute destruction of this thing.
