## I can't even stand to talk to her on the phone.
-- Right after I sprayed her?

## Hey, what's happening? Mary! Telephone. What's the matter?
Wanda...

## Oh yeah?
You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.

## What with?
-- A brillo pad, I don't care, anything.

## -- White ladies?
-- Oh my yes.

## I don't know if you don't know --
Otis is dead.

## -- Otis?
-- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George... you know better...

## -- why did you come in today?
-- left my bag, didn't have no money...

## -- how did you get here?
-- took a bus.

## Hey, baby, what's happening?
Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you know, the guy I divorced last summer.

## What're you talking about?
Gunshots, there were some gunshots.

## Where?
Here in the canyon.

## What's gonna happen?
I don't know... every once in a while I just get the feeling something awful's going to happen.

## Well, like what?
I don't know... just... somebody's going to get me.

## What?
They're dumb, somebody... I don't know...

## You said somebody... who?
I don't know. I can't remember. It was just in my dream.

## No shit?
Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.

## What?
I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm gonna open the shop. I'm getting it together.

## How?
Right now -- I'm at the epitome of my life. Right now I feel so good I'm afraid something's gonna happen.

## Honey, what happened?
I just came from a meeting... I can't talk about it now, baby. But in a few days -- see I'm disgusted with my life.

## What about me?
You're different.

## I am?
You're great.

## I am?
Yeah.

## Do you really mean that?
Hey, baby -- I'm gonna retire with you.

## Honey?
Yeah, baby.

## Will we live together?
We live together now.

## I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
Yeah.

## George.
George?

## Hey, baby, what's happening?
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.

## How did it go at the bank?
Great.

## Could I?
Yeah.

## Great... can we talk later?
George.

## When can I talk to you?
Baby, I'm in the middle of work.

## About what?
Whether or not I'm going.

## Going where?
Egypt.

## Honey, have they offered you the job?
No, but I think they might.

## I want your feelings about it.
What do you want?

## Right now?
Look, either we have a meaningful relationship or we don't, I've got to know.

## When?
When I get off work.

## When is that?
I'll call you.

## When is that, George?
I'll call you.

## Nothing, I'll call you, okay?
... Okay...

## Where's your car?
A friend dropped me off.

## Never mind. Where've you been?
A business meeting, I told you that.

## What business meeting?
Look at the way I live.

## I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight?
What do you mean, what is it? It's some political bullshit.

## What does he direct besides traffic?
Ha, ha.

## Television or movies?
Commercials.

## How come you took your own car?
I didn't want him meeting me here.

## You did fuck him, didn't you?
I'm very tired, George.

## Didn't you, baby?
Let go of me.

## Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
I'd like you to leave now.

## Where did this come from?
Who knows, I'm sure you don't -- but if it'll help any, I found it in your bed.

## So who else was there besides Jackie? Huh?... huh?
Baby, don't do this. I do love you.

## Obviously there were others, weren't there?
Obviously.

## What do you wanna know for?
I just want to know, that's all.

## What difference does it make?
I'll know you've lied to me... all along. I'll know you're incapable of... love... that'll help me... not now, but eventually.

## What? What? What? What? What?
... honest. At least you're honest with me.

## Does it make you happy?
I wish you'd go now.

## That's all you've got to say?
-- yes.

## -- tell me something -- did you talk about me?
George...

## Did you?
Please!... that's not like you.

## Yeah, I know. Did you?
George, now cut this out.

## Did you?
Stop it.

## Did you?
Yes, yes, I did.

## What did you say?
George, if you keep this up I'm going to scream.

## What did you say?
George...

## What're you here for?
-- A wash and set.

## No?
You need a cut.

## I didn't say it, she did. How'd you happen to get in that line of work?
I see.

## But what?
I'm better than the guy I work for.

## After a while that hurts... doesn't it?
It's good you want to do something, George.

## They're not?
You're right.

## George, could you -- excuse us for a minute?
Sure.

## Felicia's really interested in the shop, isn't she?
Oh yeah.

## Tonight?
-- maybe you could, on your way, you know, pick up Jackie here.

## Oh yeah?
-- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.

## What about, tonight?
See she doesn't drink too much.

## Isn't that bad for it?
This really ought to be layered...

## You live like a pig.
Layered?

## Yeah. How long have you been here?
All night.

## Well... who are those guys?
What do they look like?...

## Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.

## Well, what?
Godammit, George...

## I wanna hear it from you!
... yes, I follow your thinking on that.

## Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
Well, I don't know.

## Want a drink?
No thanks.

## I don't either, Lester, I swear to you I don't.
Who?

## I mean, how did that happen?
Lester, it just happened.

## You really think so?
Yes I do.

## What?
Yeah, the clap. That's what she thinks. But who knows -- I don't know.

## What took you so long?
Wasn't sure it was you.

## All right, who're you with? Jill?
No.

## What do you mean?
I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now... I'm not kidding.

## A soap?
A daytime soap opera.

## And?
I was too old.

## What was it, somebody's daughter?
Somebody's mother.

## You do?
Yes.

## Is that right?
Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.

## Is that right?
I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.

## No kidding? Your own shop?
I called to tell you I was sending one over but the line was busy, you're always on the phone.

## Who do you think I was talking to?
My secretary saw you with that boy.

## Steve?
Whatever his name is, that actor.

## Really? How about starting with tonight?
You and your touchy investors.

## What's that?
You're still jealous.

## Maybe he ought to go to beauty school. Anyway, see you tonight, doll, okay?
Fine.

## Aren't you going to have one?
No.

## Why not?
Because I don't want one.

## Who are they?
Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.

## Does she know about us?
Jesus, she's my best friend.

## Hi, doll, what's wrong?
You know what's wrong.

## I have to meet a client... who're you dating?
Poster-Kleiser.

## Oh yeah?
That's right.

## Who is that?
A real swinger. He's been trying to fuck me for about two hundred years.

## I am? I mean why?
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.

## So what's your point?
Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.

## Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are. You're sure you don't mind?
Don't be silly.

## You're really a love -- you sure?
-- No. No really.

## Well, what is it, honey?
Nothing.

## Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
We don't think marriage is important.

## But you have problems?
-- Yeah, honey...

## Five times a day?
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.

## Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
Well, you know what I mean.

## What?
Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time.

## He does?
Well yes -- you know that about George.

## Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
I would say so, yes.

## What?
I think you're going to hit that car in front of us.

## -- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?
-- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...

## Didn't you have any panties on?
-- He reached up and tore them.

## What did you do?
Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.

## No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
No, he picked me up and carried me out to the sundeck -- God, it was hot. The wood on the sundeck, everything.

## Egypt?
That's right.

## But why Egypt?
Well, that's where the pyramids are and we want real pyramids in the ad.

## Why don't you ask for another one?
Are you kidding? His hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here. See, you've reduced me to eating weeds.

## Is he an enemy?
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.

## -- sort of a boyfriend?
Sort of.

## What does he do? Is he an actor?
-- no.

## Getting your hair done... Would you like to go to a party?
Not with your hairdresser.

## This other couple that we're here with, do you know them very well?
Well... sure...

## George? Was he alone?
I don't think so.

## Well did he go in there with Jackie?
That bastard.

## Let's do that.
George is a hairdresser, isn't he?

## -- why?
-- these bastards have me hemmed in.

## Oh, Johnny, Mr. Karpf needed a ride home and I said we'd take him. Do you mind?
Of course not.

## You mean when are you going to Egypt?
Now I didn't mean that, you rat.

## You're going?
You're going.

## Johnny! Why didn't you tell me before?
-- just before I ask you out? I can't do that. Let's get out of here before good old Les catches up with us again.

## What's wrong?
We can't really leave that poor man here alone.

## -- what's the problem, honey?
-- his car. They have it blocked.

## Oh that's no problem. -- take care of this boy's problem, will you, Gene?
Jill.

## No... how long did you say?
Three weeks.

## Do you have children?
No.

## Are you married?
No.

## Do you have something against traveling?
No.

## Have they sat down?
Everybody but us.

## Everything okay, son?
Terrific. Now all I have to do is find my car keys.

## Oh, say, how would you kids like to stop off for a drink?
Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.

## Yes?
I'm hungry.

## You mean they ate each other up?
They had to, in order to survive.

## Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
Come here for a minute, first.

## How's it going, Doc?
Okay.

## Are you having a good time?
Yes, Dad.

## I am, Dad. Dad?
Yes.

## Do you feel bad?
No. I'm just a little tired.

## Then why don't you go to sleep?
I can't. I have too much to do.

## Yes I do. I love it. Don't you?
I guess so.

## Did your mother ever say that to you - that I would hurt you?
No, Dad.

## Are you sure?
Yes, Dad.

## You don't? Well what's your favorite food then?
French Fries and Ketchup.

## Do you like ice cream, Doc?
Yeah.

## Why don't you want to talk about it?
I'm not supposed to.

## Who says you ain't supposed to?
Tony.

## Who's Tony?
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.

## Is Tony the one that tells you things?
Yes.

## How does he tell you things?
It's like I go to sleep, and he shows me things but when I wake up, I can't remember everything.

## Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?
Yes.

## Do they know he tell you things?
I don't know.

## Is there something bad here?
Well, you know Doc, when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind... say like is someone burns toast.

## You're scared of Room 237, ain'tcha?
No I ain't.

## Yeah.
Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?

## Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.

## We're just going to go into one of the other rooms for a few minutes and talk - then I'll come back and check on you, okay?
Okay.

## We'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel, okay?
Okay, Mom.

## Hey, wasn't it around here that the Donner party got snowbound?
Jack...

## The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?
All right.

## Yeah.
And you're gonna lose. And I'm gonna get you - you betta run fast! Look out - I'm coming in close. All right?

## I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
No.

## Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
Not right now, Daddy's asleep.

## Come on, Doc. He only went to bed a few hours ago. Can't you wait till later?
I won't make a sound, I promise. I'll tip-toe.

## Make sure you come right back, 'cause I'm going to make lunch soon. Okay?
Okay, Mom.

## Danny?
Red Rum. Red Rum. Red Rum.

## Danny... what's the matter, hon?
Red Rum.

## Oh!
No.

## Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?
Yes.

## Now Danny, can you remember what you were doing just before you started brushing your teeth?
Talking to Tony.

## Is Tony one of your animals?
No.

## Why not?
Because he hides.

## Where does he go?
To my stomach.

## Do I have to?
Yes, I'd like you to.

## Shall we go into the living room?
Yes.

## Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs. Torrance?
Only about three months. Eh we're from Vermont. My husband was teaching school there.

## Did the appearance of Danny's imaginary friend...?
Tony.

## Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
No, um let's see I guess Danny started talkin to Tony about the time we put him into nursery school.

## What sort of injury did he have?
Ah he dislocated his shoulder.

## How did he manage to do that?
Oh I wouldn't think of it.

## Well how can I repay you?
It's okay, really.

## Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?
Sure.

## Advocaat is it?
Yes sir. Look um... I think the best thing is to come along to the gentlemen's room, sir, and eh...

## Grady?
Yes, sir.

## haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Why no, sir. I don't believe so.

## Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
Why no, sir. I don't believe so.

## And, er... where are they now?
Oh, they're somewhere around. I'm not quite sure at the moment, sir.

## Who?
A nigger.

## How?
Well, he is a very willful boy.

## You give your word on that do you, Mr. Torrance?
Good evening. Forest Service.

## I'd be glad to do that, sir. Oh why don't you call me back in about eh twenty minutes?
Thank you very much. I'll do that.

## Oh, that's just great. How do you folks like our hotel so far?
It will be a pleasure. Right this way Mrs. Torrance.

## Mrs. Torrance, your husband introduced you as Winifred. Now are you a Winnie or a Freddie?
I'm a Wendy.

## Yeah, this is it. How do you like it, Danny? Is it big enough for you?
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.

## Beg pardon?
Doc. You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.

## Yeah. We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons. But how did you know that?
Well I guess I probably heard you call him that.

## Bill, how do you do?
Pleased to meet you.

## What line of work are you in now?
I'm a writer um... Teaching has been more or less a way of making ends meet.

## How's my credit in this joint anyway?
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.

## How are things going, Mr. Torrance?
Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.

## No charge?
Your money's no good here.

## Hi, hon. How's it going?
Great. Look, I'm at the hotel and I still have an awful lot to go through. I don't think I can get home before nine or ten.

## God, I've never seen anything like this before. Are all of these Indian designs authentic?
Perfect for a child.

## What time is it?
It's about eleven thirty.

## It's really pretty outside. How about taking me for a walk after you've finished your breakfast?
Oh I suppose I oughta try to do some writing first.

## Any ideas yet?
Lots of ideas. No good ones.

## It's really nice up here, isn't it?
I love it. I really do. I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.

## What do you want me to do about it?
Ah, come on hon. Don't be so grouchy.

## and it will then take me time to get back to where I was, understand?
Yes.

## Fine. Why don't you start right now and get the fuck out of here, hmm?
I had... I had the most terrible nightmare I ever had. It's the most horrible dream I ever had.

## Did you find anything?
No, nothing at all.

## You went into the room Danny said - to 237?
Yes, I did.

## Absolutely nothing. How is he?
He's still asleep.

## Get him out of here?
Yes.

## You mean just leave the hotel?
Yes.

## Shovellings out driveways, work in a car wash - any of that appeal to you?
I...

## You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
Yes...

## When do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
As soon as possible.

## Why?
I just want to go back to my room.

## Wendy...
Why?

## Yes?
I'm Jack Torrance.

## Have any trouble finding us?
Oh, no problem at all. I made the trip in three and a half hours.

## JAck, just make yourself at home. Would you like some coffee?
Well, if you are going to have some, I wouldn't mind. Thanks.

## How about your wife and son? How do you think they'll take to it?
They'll love it.

## I don't suppose they eh told you anything in Denver about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970?
I don't believe they did.

## Good. Glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen. Is your family having a look around?
No, my son's discovered the games room.

## Oh... Has your luggage been brought in?
Right there.

## Oh, it's beautiful. My God, this place is fantastic, isn't it hon?
Yes, I believe they are based mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.

## Royalty?
All the best people.

## Boy, I bet you we could really have a good party in this room, huh hon?
Thanks.

## How're you getting on?
It's amazing how much activity is going on today.

## Just like a ghost ship, huh?
Yes.

## How do you do?
Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for this winter. I would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through.

## Lowe's car-?
Blue. This blue.

## Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.

## Can I tell you kids something?
Sure, Uncle Al.

## A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
I don't want your money. You're a booger.

## Marty? You okay? You've just been sitting here all morning.
Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?

## Went shopping. Why?
Jane, I have to talk to you.

## Will you marry me, Jane?
Please, Uncle Al.

## Are you all right, Marty?
All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.

## You're a real booger, you know it?
You booger.

## For getting a divorce?
Well... it is his third.

## What?
I've been hearing noises in there.

## What kind of noises?
Rattling. Rustling.

## Let the boy finish the game, Nan.
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?

## You all right, Marty?
Yeah.

## There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one?
No.

## What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?
It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair.

## Your mom's not around, is she?
She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.

## What?
Wait, dear boy. Just wait. Hand me those pliars.

## Do I need one?
We're gonna find out. Take it down the road a ways and back. Be careful.

## I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
Sure.

## Yeah! What is it?
Yeah... sure.

## What is it?
A tracer. You'll like it.

## What the hell does that matter?
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.

## Marty, do you see your suspect?
I told you!

## What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
I want you to turn this into a silver bullet.

## You're not going to let it go, are you?
I saw what I saw.

## Yeah? Really?
Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still are. Learn from your elders, dearies.

## What if I say no?
Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy. Go on, now.

## Oh?
I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years. What a marvelous program. Innovative. Inspiring. You are to be commended.

## Really?
Really.

## What about crack? You a user?
I said I was a nun, not an asshole.

## Yes, Mary?
We were talking about the wild thing. Teen promiscuity.

## How come? Sister?
Well... because it's in the Bible. \"Thou shalt not...\" Thou shalt not.

## Excuse me -- just what are you all doing here? At Sunday School?
Cause we love it so damn much. And cause we gotta come here. Probation.

## And you listen to that?
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.

## What you do?
Just tell him, I do love you, but I can't -- I'm a nun.

## Hey, Sisters. Are you going in there?
You know it.

## His ashes?
With love.

## What?
You can handle this.

## What?
That... thing. That nun thing. Take it off.

## What did who say?
Who? The other woman. Your wife.

## How did I get so lucky? What is it now, five years we've been together? Who do I thank?
Today was the deadline, Vince.

## You said that? And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her? Did he say we'd be happy?
He said that if I got a divorce I'd burn in Hell. For all eternity.

## You lying sleazeball! The best years of my life! What am I, garbage? Am I lint?
No... it's fine.

## Yes?
Thanks. A lot.

## Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me?
Sure.

## Yes, Betty?
Look at that. Get a gander.

## Yes, Betty?
HE'S SO FINE.

## Isn't it a glorious morning? Good morning, Mary Clarence. sleep well?
Right.

## I haven't heard that song in ages. The Ronettes?
Not in years.

## But don't you get money? From the Vatican?
Mary Clarence. Goose. We're completely self-supporting. Like all convents. Like yours.

## Is this... choir practice?
Sure is! Come on in, and sing a spell.

## Chops?
Two days. An hour or so.

## We know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors. We'll pray to find you some honest work.
Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups?

## Were you wicked?
Enough jabber.

## What?
Progressive convents. Vanity. It sounds awful. It sounds just like this place.

## Like this place?
Shirelles.

## Soprano or alto?
Whatever.

## Mary Clarence, are you with us?
Um, I don't really know this one...

## What?
You're a ringer. She brought you in to replace me. Out with the old.

## I hear you. How many days a week do you rehearse?
I don't know. Mary Lazarus, what do you think? They're pretty raw.

## Is there any syrup?
We could cut a demo. Look for a label.

## Hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one. Why do I suddenly feel like Snow White?
You re okay -- for a civilian.

## What? What time is it?
It's after five. We have to bathe.

## What? What does she want now? I did the dishes. I oiled the pews. I dusted the hymnals. Two hundred hymnals. Why can't people share?
I... I...

## What?
I... I brought you something.

## A cigarette?
An extra heel of bread. Please take it, you need your strength. You've been working so hard.

## Thanks. So which one are you? Sister Bruce? Sister Doug?
Mary Robert. I'm... Mary Robert.

## So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. K's?
Three years. Sister.

## You have to help me
Yeah, like a learner's permit, right? When do you hit the big time? You know, when do you take the final vows?

## She said that? Reverend Mother?
Well, then there's only one thing to do.

## What?
We must do this sacred thing, Mary Robert.

## Of course! We must do it! It's the will of God! What is it?
We must... get you some experience. We must... leave this place.

## Experience! Right?
Right.

## Who are all these people?
I don't know, some people just don't like nuns. I wish I had a ruler.

## What?
Mary Robert, I've watched you. You never really sing. You whisper. Nothing comes out.

## Are you leaving us?
Oh no. We'll always be together.

## Wait, this isn't the way. Who are you?
Parochial school. Akron. St. Android's.

## The reason?
I see.

## What?
Miss Van Cartier.

## What?
Your cigarette -- out.

## Are you talking about me?
And all those like you.

## You mean black people?
Absolutely not. I mean the wicked. The heedless. And their Las Vegas concubines.

## What's a concubine?
Check your driver's license.

## Would you like that?
Excused. Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.

## Mary Clarence? Like a guy? Like a dumb guy?
No problem.

## Like to who?
And the vow of chastity.

## A what?
Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence. Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.

## Silence? No talking? All day?
Until sundown.

## A what?
A fast. To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.

## No food?
No food. Not until sundown.

## Is this all the food I get?
Yes. Until breakfast.

## That's tomorrow! Don't you have any snacks? Machines?
This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.

## My what?
Your cell. Your room.

## You were right the first time. Is this like, solitary? The cooler? Where's the furniture?
Our lives are simple. We have little need for material possessions.

## Right, sure thing. But what about, like, appliances? Like a little color portable? Boom box?
Useless distractions.

## Oh, I don't know... Satan?
Your cell is more than adequate.

## Right. So what do we do now? Ping- Pong? Row over to the monastery?
It is nine p.m. Pleasant dreams.

## What's wrong with my life?
From all I've heard, just about everything. Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead.

## Yeah?
It never solves anything.

## A decent life? Excuse me? As what? A janitor?
Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.

## I am?
You may stay. But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.

## What?
You have, I believe, some minimal background in music. Therefore, you are to join our choir.

## Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals?
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.

## A vote?
But... wait a minute...

## You sent for me?
You have a phone call.

## What?
I have submitted my resignation to Bishop O'Hara. Privately. I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.

## But -- why?
I must go where I can be of use.

## Reverend Mother -- Thank-you.
What are you doing here?

## Oh?
You saved my life.

## I don't think so. What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?
You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert. We shall have a serious discussion.

## Really? And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
Don't push it.

## Yeah, like what? Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out? Lottery tickets? A travel iron?
So I don't shop.

## When are you gonna get off my case? Have you got a search warrant? What do you want -- cheap thrills?
Then-you run.

## Ten flights?
You'd lose. You'd die. All over the sidewalk. And into the street.

## What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
I'm gonna put you in the last place on Earth that Vince would ever look for you.

## Safest place in the world. You think Vince would look for you here?
Nuns, Eddie. There are nuns here. Everywhere. It's crawling with 'em.

## I can't stay here! I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?
Pray.

## Like what?
Keeping our witnesses alive. We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.

## What'd she say?
You blew it -- big time. She doesn't want you back.

## Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
She's counting on it. She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival.

## So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
It wasn't my fault! They just showed up. It's helping the convent.

## I am?
Yeah. You look... great. I mean it..

## Really? Lieutenant?
I've been worried about you.

## You mean -- worried about my testimony?
No -- worried about you. Personally.

## You're not... seeing anybody?
No. Most of the time I'm thinking about you. And now... you've really changed.

## I have?
You re sort of... radiant. your eyes are shining. You're rea1ly different...

## Just remember - you're a target. Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
I know, I know. I'll be careful. I'll try.

## I can't go with you.
How?

## What're you doing?
Even nuns have to pee.

## Yeah, Eddie, thanks a whole bunch. Thanks for sticking me in a convent. So you think, after all this, maybe I really am a nun?
I don't know. There's only one way to be absolutely sure.

## Yeah, like what?
Hey, girls.

## You won't even tell us?
I wouldn't even tell the Pope.

## Who are you guys?
Maybe.

## And if she runs?
Take care of it.

## It's done?
Not... totally.

## But, Vince, how do you know she didn't like, join up and become a nun when she was in that convent?
It didn't happen.

## Well?
It didn't work, Vince.

## Where is she?
Yeah, right -- when I see it.

## For like, twelve zillion eternities?
A sweater.

## What's she doing?
She's praying.

## Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's.

## She shouldn't have come back. She knew she was in danger.
Sister Mary Patrick?

## But -- why would anyone kidnap a nun?
She told us about one. The Little Sisters of the Moonlight. In Las Vegas.

## Which convent was that, Sister?
Mary Clarence has a background in music. That's what Reverend Mother said.

## Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have. Where did you get this?
Maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us.

## We can't sing without her! What should we do?
We'll pray -- and she'll be there.

## You mean -- they kidnapped her?
Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.

## Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun?
A Benedictine.

## I don't understand. Where is she?
Her whereabouts are unknown, and we must proceed without her. Pull yourselves together.

## Calm down. Think clearly. Mary Robert, do you have any idea who those men were?
She said they were from her old convent.

## Yes?
Absolutely not. I am very sorry, but no.

## Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... how lonely?
It's that call you were expecting, Vince.

## Can you hold? Can you try?
She's a nun, Vince.

## If we could speak alone.
Okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right?

## Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman?
Many have.

## Who took the meat?
Must have been the Redman. A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.

## Hail, Constable. How are you?
Well enough. Your gathering does honor to the deceased.

## Um... I... I did not... no. Why?
Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting. This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse.

## How did you hear this?
Certainly not.

## You are the blacksmith. Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
Never. A shoe that size I would have remembered.

## Two days... ? For murder?
Constable Crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side.

## I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?
I was afraid of this.

## Why did you move the body, Doctor?
To place it inside its coffin.

## What is that?
This should have bled by the pint. Yet, no blistering or scorched flesh. How... ? Whatever weapon was used... it cauterized somehow....

## What are you spying on?
The Lenape. He comes to gawk at civilization from time to time.

## You will stay at her side?
... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.

## What of it?
No clotting or gathering of pus. No healing at all.

## What?
When this cut was made, this person was already dead. This is not Lady Van Tassel.

## Why not tell us what you have heard? Hmm? How much have your superiors bothered to tell you?
All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...

## Does that look like an animal hanging?
No. You will not run me out. No one will believe a word of what you say.

## Do you have these persons' wills?
I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.

## May we look at them now?
Of course. You want them... it shall not take long. Wait here.

## Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?
Well... that might be... helpful.

## Have they nothing to fear presently?
Without disrespect, look around you. We overflow. As do our courts.

## But, how many innocents rot here? And, how many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets?
Very few, if any.

## Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.

## Chosen me?
These \"methods\" of yours... there has been no practical application.

## Tell me something. What becomes of Young Masbath?
Van Ripper and his wife agreed to take him. They have children and a good home and good land.

## The militia?
The Van Garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife and two infants. And the Widow Windsor was next...

## Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
He would not have gone into the Western Woods. No sane man would.

## What is that you wear?
My talisman. It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face. But, I cannot run. If I run in fear, it is worthless.

## Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
We are farmers here, not lawyers or bankers, or even constables. Every penny we earn comes from what we send down the Hudson.

## What is the common thread between these victims?
I'm sure I don't know.

## Where are we going?
Up.

## What is it?
It's payment day. Loan monies are given to Baltus the last day each month. Almost everyone borrows... for tools or to hire workers.

## Out there. What do you see?
The Western Woods.

## What kind of nuts?
Not for eating, I assure you. Watch here.

## What is it?
Listen.

## What happened?
Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies. To the tree of the dead. Maybe we passed it by.

## How could something named \"the tree of the dead\" fail to draw attention?
We should not go much further in this murk.

## Should we go back?
We are far from the Hollow. Loath to say it... better to get our backs against a tree and stay till morning.

## What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place?
If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian. Someone only tried to make it look that way.

## Then, who murdered the Old Crone? And why?
Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.

## What is it?
Stay back.

## Must be some sort of gateway. But, why this place... ?
We should go.

## Why this tree?
Someone left last night. Looked like they headed to the square, but I lost them in the forest.

## Man or woman?
All I saw was their lantern.

## What good is this?
To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place.

## But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
No one yet, far as I can tell. It has gone intestate.

## In test... what?
Intestate. Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.

## What does it mean?
Baltus Van Tassel.

## Did your father take a loan?
Lady Van Tassel.

## Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it. Did you find the victims' loan agreements?
No. They are all missing.

## What books?
Fiction plays and novels. Baltus does not approve. Now, come. It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns.

## She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir? Sir?
I need time for thinking. Without you hanging on my coattails for a change.

## Won't you change your mind, sir? What can I say to convince you?
Nothing. To hell with this place and all the people here.

## Why... why are you like this?
You do not know all that has happened. You cannot understand.

## What can we do?
Take the reins.

## What now?
I doubt that's the end.

## How are you?
Tired.

## You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?
Feel free to form your own opinion. Though it appears you already have.

## Other people?
Small talk.

## Is it me, or are you this nervous around all women?
Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.

## My suitor?
The massive fellow... Brom. For someone you call \"friend,\" he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.

## Are you so superstitious?
To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.

## Really? Then... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop?
Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.

## May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
You pay great attention to small things. I hide these as I hide all my books. Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.

## These scars. How did you get them?
I have had them since childhood. I cannot remember what from.

## Yes, he does. May I try?
He only appears to be inside the cage. The point being...

## You made this, and the drawings?
Yes, but listen. The illusion is easily explained. The eye retains each image, till they combine. And yet, some would call this toy magic.

## Oh, you are hopeless. May I keep it at least?
If you want. But...

## If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I?
People have put their trust in you.

## Why would you do such a thing?
No stone may be left unturned. It may appear harsh...

## What are you on about?
The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing. The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.

## And this gives worth to butchery?
It was not butchery.

## What is it then? Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?
I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.

## What troubles you?
The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them.

## What has happened?
Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she? She bears so little resemblance.

## She died. Her lungs were diseased... two years ago. What is this about?
Memories have come back. I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now. Lord, how I hate this place.

## If you want me to go, I will. Do you want me to leave?
I... I do not know. I no longer know what I think or what I feel.

## Katrina. Why do you follow?
I apologize if I worried you.

## What are you doing?
Just... keep where you are.

## My God... what has happened?
He... he tries to take the heads... they will not pass.

## Why is it every grave I open holds a new mystery inside?
The skull is gone.

## What... what are you doing... ?
I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.

## What is so urgent?
Come with me.

## And, what did he say?
He did not do these things. If you knew him, you would realize...

## What did he say, Katrina?
I have not been able to face him yet.

## What would you have me believe?
If you think I am behind this, say it.

## Where are we going?
I do not know. Away.

## What was that?
His horse.

## TASSEL You said yourself. What mere man could have downed the Belltower?
It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical.

## TASSEL Returning to the Western Woods?
Yes, actually.

## TASSEL She has taken the last of our grain to be milled. You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?
Very little. I must be going...

## TASSEL Look closer. Do you have anything to clean it with?
It is fine. Now, I must...

## What... ?
TASSEL You cannot kill what is already dead.

## Van Ripper. Can you show where the body lay?
I can show exactly.

## There was not much blood, was there?
Yes. Here...

## You are from the Hollow?
In a way, yes.

## Can you help?
You want to see into the nether world... I can show you. Whatever you see, do not move or speak. I will hold him.

## What... what are you doing?
Close your mouth! Keep silent.

## TASSEL Am I? Or, are you and Young Masbath dead along with me?
TASSEL He rides tonight.

## May I see my mother?
You do not want to be here. Go home to your father.

## Scooter, did I tell about the two old boys pissin' off the bridge?
I can't remember.

## You got any money?
They give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose. I spent up some of it on ridin' the bus and eatin' french-fried potaters.

## All right then. I'll see you bright and early. How you comin' along on that garden tiller?
I fixed it. Hit's a workin' pretty good.

## Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?
I remember it real well. Cut them folks to pieces. His mama one of 'em.

## He won't have anything to do with him. Now you say it's all right for him to stay out here in the back?
Fine with me. If he steals anything, I'll take it out of your pocket anyway.

## Doin' pretty good. Got a sick tiller here. What's got you down this way?
Just thought I'd check on Karl and see if everything's working out.

## Can I see him?
Sure.

## Can I help you?
I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.

## You have any biscuits for sale?
Naw, we don't have biscuits.

## What you got that's good to eat?
Well, I guess it's all good.

## What do you like to eat here?
French fries. I like to eat them pretty good.

## What you got in there, warshing?
Yeah.

## Ain't you got no mama and daddy to tend to it?
I got a mama, but she's at work over at Ben's Dollar Store. My daddy's dead. He got hit by a train.

## How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh?
About a half a mile I think it is.

## My name is Frank Wheatley. What's your name?
Karl's my name.

## Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
Yeah.

## We run outta somethin' to drink. Goin' to the county line. You want to race?
You know better than that. We're on duty. Catch me in that Camaro next week one night.

## I ain't sayin' it's right. I'm just tellin' the truth. What was he in the nuthouse for?
He's just mentally retarded, I guess.

## Ain't that the sweetest thing. What am I supposed to do about supper with you traipsin' around with that fag?
You're not crippled. Get in there and make somethin'.

## You know what we ought to do tonight?
Please Doyle, don't.

## What do you want, hun?
We'll go to church and get you baptized, tomorrow's Sunday. You go on back to bed.

## How'd your baptizin' go?
It went real good.

## All right, y'all gonna go with me?
Naw, hell, let them stay here with me and do men things. There might be some kind of ball game on we can watch. You go on.

## Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you, was I? Was I?
No sir.

## That's ridiculous. That's just a total lie.
Karl can stay if he wants to. Mama said --

## You like that Vaughan?
Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.

## You enjoying yourself, Karl?
I'd better go on home now, it's late. I have to work tomorrow.

## I bet you like sittin' between two men in a dual wheel truck don't you?
This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.

## What's all them books?
Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.

## You believe in the Bible?
A good deal of it, I reckon. Can't understand all of it.

## How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?
Pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em, I guess.

## What numbers do you punch?
I aim to kill you with it.

## What's you last name?
Childers.

## What are all them books?
Different ones. One's the Bible. One of 'ems a book on Christmas. One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.

## Don't you live somewhere?
I did live there in the state hospital.

## They let you out?
Yeah.

## How come?
They told me I was well. They had to turn me loose.

## Are you well?
I reckon I feel all right.

## Do you like to play football?
I never was much count at it. I never did get picked out fer it.

## Hey there. I thought I heard somebody on the porch. Wasn't your name Karl?
Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.

## Yeah. What you doin' by here?
You told me to come by.

## Did you want to play ball with us?
I ain't no good at it. I just come by.

## I was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. Reckon they sell toothpaste?
They sell some of everything. Come on let's go. I won't tell her about you bein' in the state hospital for killin'.

## They still around, your folks?
My mother's dead. My daddy's s'posed to be around still. He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though.

## How do you know?
He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much.

## How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her?
Karl. You know when I said daddy got hit by a train.

## Who did you kill?
Two people.

## Were they bad people?
I thought they was.

## It's okay if you're lookin' out for yourself. If it's self-defense. Was it self-defense?
I'd like to kill that son of a bitch. I hate him.

## Will you stay here with us for a long time?
I reckon if you want me to. I got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some.

## Hey Karl, you off work?
Yeah.

## Where'd you get them flowers?
That gal that made employee of the month give 'em to me for awalkin' with her.

## I was goin' to the secret place. I borried one of your books to take down there. You ain't mad, are you?
Naw. You can look at all my books you want to.

## You want to go with me?
Yeah.

## Boy, folks sure had it rough back a long time ago, didn't they?
Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like to tore me up when I read about that pore little cripple boy.

## I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me?
They ort to. You're a good boy.

## What do you mean?
Pull on your works. Your privates.

## Oh, jackin' off?
Yes sir. You ort not know that language.

## And then some people you don't like right off. It's funny. You know why I want you to play ball with me?
Naw.

## Why not? It died?
Yeah.

## It was alive?
Yes sir. Right then it was.

## A boy or girl?
A little ol' boy.

## It was still alive when you buried it?
I heared it cryin' a little through that box.

## She said she'd see me later. That's kinda good, right?
I reckon.

## What you readin'?
I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is.

## Is that right?
I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if neither one of us is no count it won't make no difference.

## You will? For sure?
Yeah.

## We'll be on teams, me and you?
Yessir.

## It don't matter to me about us losin' does it to you?
No sir.

## Can we play ever' Saturday?
If I ain't too stove up. I ain't like you. I'm old and give out. I'm proud of ye.

## I knowed you'd be here. What are you a-doin' digging with that stob?
I'm glad of it you was borned. I reckon I ain't gonna be there in the garage no more.

## Man. Thanks. You know when you get a feelin' and you don't know why?
Yes sir.

## Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to?
You know I would. Whatever you want.

## Okay. I give you my word. Is ever'thing gonna be okay? Are you all right?
Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then I'm gonna go on and leave here.

## Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?
Nice to meet you, Karl.

## Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?
Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl got things we need to do.

## How come Karl won't eat here with us?
I don't know. He just said he'd eat out there.

## You all right, Mama?
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.

## No, honey, we don't. I'll make some coffee and start cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you want some coffee, huh?
What are you doin' up again, Frank? You need to get a little sleep.

## Did Vaughan go home?
Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.

## Did Karl go to bed?
I bet he don't. Karl likes me.

## Huh?
Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about.

## Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?
I love you, too, Mama.

## You walk fast, don't you?
I reckon.

## These is the worst shoes I own for walkin'. How far did you want to go?
I ain't really thought about it too much I don't reckon.

## Karl, what in the world are you doing here?
I want to come back and stay here.

## Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?
Naw.

## I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?
I reckon.

## Karl, you up?
Yes sir.

## Didn't you go to sleep at all, Karl? You been sittin' there like that all night?
Yes sir.

## Are you sure you're okay staying with that woman and boy?
Yes sir.

## Do they know about you?
My history.

## Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?
Tolerable, I reckon.

## Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
No ma'am.

## Right now?
Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.

## Was that you? I remember that. I was only three or four, but I always heard about it growin' up. They say you're well?
Yes ma'am. I like your garage. I wouldn't never hurt you or your boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.

## Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't you want some chicken and things?
No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.

## Where'd he go? What's goin' on?
He wanted to go off and play, I reckon. You go in there and you and that Doyle eat ye dinner. You don't have to worry yourself none.

## Ma'am?
Yeah.

## It's been here seventeen years. Did you live here before or something?
I's horned and raised here up till I's twelve year old.

## Why are you here now?
They turned me loose from the state hospital.

## Is that right? Are you going to be staying here long?
I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.

## Do you have family here?
Not really to speak of.

## So, you're really going to stay here?
That boy wants me to.

## Did you knock on the door yet?
Naw, I ain't.

## How long have you been standing here?
Quite a spell, I reckon.

## Listen, before you get very used to staying here, I think you and I need to talk about a few things. Can I take you to lunch?
I done et just a little bit ago.

## Well that's a very offensive way to put it. You shouldn't say that. You were taught that, weren't you?
I've heard it said that way.

## Oh. How about before that?
Before that I was thinkin' it'd be good if I could get another three or four cans of that potted meat if you got any extry.

## Can I help you, sir?
He just got out of the state hospital.

## Are you sure it's safe to let him around that guy?
Frank's just crazy about him. He likes the way he talks. He helped him carry home the clean laundry.

## What about me?
I don't think he sees you as a guy guy.

## Karl is a guy guy?
Good. I haven't decided yet if I'm a good cook.

## Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda was voted employee of the month at the Dollar Store last February. Isn't that somethin'?
Karl, maybe you and Melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner. It's a nice night.

## Do you smell shit?
Yeah.

## Why won't he talk to women?
My name's Jerry Woolridge.

## Y'all have a seat. Is this all of you?
Yes sir.

## That's really strange. What does it mean?
One of his Daddy's Bible lessons I imagine. Y'all pull up a chair. I'll go out and talk to him.

## How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?
It's the best you're gonna get. I'm sorry.

## Signs?
Homicidal signs. Oh, we're gonna change the light in here for Karl. I hope you can see to write.

## Is he leaving right this minute?
We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.

## Where will he go?
Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.

## Will he be supervised?
As much as anybody else is, I guess. Y'all have a good rest of the day now.

## Why?
Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private.

## You mean about y'all bein' together in \"that\" way?
It's my birthday.

## And how many people will be attending this birthday party?
Ah-hah, I see. A cozy dinner. But aren't threesomes a little awkward? How does the phrase go--

## And what are you, his chaperone?
Actually, I'm his father.

## Will that be cash or charge?
Better make it charge.

## I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
I confess.

## So your mother grew up in Shanghai?
Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'forty-nine.

## And your father? Is he from New York?
Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.

## And the bookstore? Have you been working there long?
It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation.

## What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.

## Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true. Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
Melville, huh? It's been a while.

## Jesus, what happened to you?
It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.

## What happened?
I'll tell you all about it... ... but not here.

## Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission. How's Melville?
Almost done. A week or ten days, and I'll be there.

## Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?
Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow. It doesn't seem to be too long.

## What'll it be, Auggie?
Uh... My friend over here would like a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale.

## What about for you?
For me? I'll have the same thing.

## What's the difference?
It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.

## Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?
Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a lighter while you're at it.

## The boys and I were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars. Some interesting connections there, don't you think?
Definitely. I suppose it all goes back to Queen Elizabeth.

## Not Elizabeth the Second, Elizabeth the First. Did you ever hear of Sir Walter Raleigh?
Seven eighty-five out of twenty. Take care of yourself now, and don't do anything I wouldn't do.

## Do you think I could buy some before you leave?
No problem. It's not as though I'm rushing off to the opera or anything.

## It's yours?
It's mine all right. I've owned that little sucker for a long time.

## How'd you get started?
Taking pictures? It's a long story. I'd need two or three drinks to get through that one.

## Amazing. I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project?
It's kind of overwhelming.

## What do you mean?
I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.

## Slow down, huh?
Yeah, that's what I'd recommend. You know how it is. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, time creeps on its petty pace.

## So, what brings you to a dive like this?
It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.

## Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.

## Don't be an ass, Auggie. He's trying to make it up to you, can't you see that?
He's crazy.

## Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds?
Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.

## You haven't heard from Rashid, have you?
Not a peep.

## Nice machine, Auggie. Where'd you find it?
It's Tommy's. The sucker owed me a favor.

## Hey, man, how's it going?
Hi, Auggie.

## Two, right?
Uh, better make it one.

## Anything good?
It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.

## I have to pee. If the waiter comes, order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay?
You got it.

## So. Are we ready?
Ready. Any time you are.

## Did you ever go back to see her?
She probably died.

## Anything for art, eh, Paul?
I wouldn't say that. But at least you've put the camera to good use.

## And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you?
Yes, I suppose I do.

## What do you mean?
I mean, it's a good story.

## Exactly. Life just wouldn't be worth living, would it?
Christ, Ruby, it's been so long. I figured you were dead.

## And you think it looks better to go around dressed up like Captain Hook?
You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.

## All right, sugar, what's on your mind?
Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.

## Like what?
Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up. I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming.

## Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?
Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything. And besides, it's not for me. It's for our daughter.

## I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap right now. Was that your idea to call her Felicity?

## You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?
Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.

## Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
Who the hell knows? He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.

## You're a cold-hearted bastard, aren't you? How'd you ever get so mean, Auggie?
I know you think I'm lying to you, but I'm not. Every word I told you is the God's honest truth.

## You don't give up, do you?
Just get in and shut up. I'm not asking you to do anything. I just need you to come with me.

## Where to?
Dammit, Auggie, don't ask so many questions. Just get in the car.

## You what?
It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.

## Yeah, like what?
That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.

## And what's that supposed to mean?
She looks just like you.

## So you're just going to give up and go home?
I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.

## Why don't you open it and find out?
Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.

## And you're giving it to me?
It's all yours, baby.

## For keeps?
For keeps.

## How long you been working for me, Auggie?
I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.

## It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for?
I don't know. Maybe because I love you so much, boss.

## You don't take anything seriously, do you?
I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day.

## I'll be back in about an hour. Watch the register while I'm gone, okay?
Sure thing. See you later.

## This way, gentlemen. Let's retire to my office, shall we?
It's for you.

## For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?
Open it.

## What is this, some kind of joke?
No, it's five thousand dollars.

## And why the hell would you give me money?
So I can get my job back.

## Your job? You've got five thousand bucks. What do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for?
To look at the dirty magazines. I can see all the naked women I want, and it doesn't cost me a cent.

## You're a dumb, whacked-out little fuck, do you know that?
Come on, come on, you yellow belly. The whole thing. First name and last name.

## How'd you do out there, Jimmy?
Good, Auggie. Real good. All finished.

## Huh?
I just do what you tell me, Auggie. You tell me to sweep, so I sweep.

## Okay, Auggie, I got it. You don't have to yell.
Sure, Auggie, I got it. The store's closed. And when do I tell them it's open?

## Of course it hurts. What does it look like?
I thought maybe he was pretending.

## And how much are these?
Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.

## And these?
Fifty-six. That girl had on a corset.

## And these?
Forty-four. They're on special this week from the Canary Islands. A real bargain.

## The refrigerator?
Thanks for the tip.

## What can I do for you?
I just want to know what your game is, mister, that's all.

## The damn lock's broken again. And so you just barge in on strangers, is that what you do? Is that your game?
I'm looking for my nephew, Thomas.

## Thomas? Who's Thomas?
Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister.

## Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since.

## As far as I know, he went back to his parents.
Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't calm down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now!

## His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?
That's what he said. He told me he lived with his mother and father on East Seventy-fourth Street.

## He doesn't go to the Trinity School?
He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.

## And his parents?
His mother's dead, and he hasn't seen his father in twelve years.

## Which brings me back to my original question. What was he doing here in the first place?
He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is.

## Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass of water?
No thank you.

## And you told your nephew about it?
I figured he had a right to know.

## Those are pretty hostile words.
And?

## You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?
Jesus.

## You going to sit here all day?
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.

## I'm not going to rob you, mister. Do I look like a thief?
I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.

## Son-of-a-bitch. You're some piece of work, aren't you?
I just tell it like it is, mister. If I'm getting on your nerves, though, you might want to think about hiring me.

## You named the kid after yourself, huh?
That boy's one in a million. A real tiger.

## Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
Thomas.

## Paul. Rashid. Thomas. Which one is it?
Thomas.

## Yeah? Who is it?
It's me, honey. It's Mom.

## What do you want me to say?
I don't know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad. Something like that.

## Baby? And what baby is that?
Your baby. The baby you're carrying around inside you.

## I'll tell you why they're not going anywhere.
What are you talking about?

## Yeah? And why is that?
Management. Those guys are walking around with their heads up their asses.

## You still have that watch Auggie gave you?
Tick-tock, tick-tock.

## So what's the time?
Twelve-eleven. Twelve-twelve. Twelve-twelve.

## And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
East Seventy-fourth Street.

## Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it?
That's where the what comes in.

## You can't be more specific than that?
Here and there. Around.

## But your body is in the world, isn't it? If someone offered you a place to stay, you wouldn't necessarily refuse, would you?
People don't do that kind of thing. Not in New York.

## I'm not \"people.\" I'm just me. And I do whatever I goddamn want to do. Got it?
Thanks, but I'll manage.

## Nice drawing. Did you do that?
My father did. Believe it or not, that little baby is me.

## Is your father an artist?
No, he was a schoolteacher. But he liked to dabble.

## He's dead?
Drawing's a good thing.

## Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
Yeah, sometimes. I like to dabble, too.

## What time is it?
Eight-thirty.

## Jesus, do you make a lot of noise. Can't you see I'm trying to work?
I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.

## A little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think?
I'm a teenager. All teenagers are clumsy. It's because we're still growing. We don't know where our bodies end and the world begins.

## Twenty dollars is a lot of money. Are you sure you can trust me with it? I mean, aren't you afraid I might steal it?
If you want to steal it, that's your business. At least I won't have you around here making noise. It might be worth it.

## How long have you been here?
Three nights.

## And how long did I tell you you could stay?
Two or three nights.

## I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to me ... But all good things have to come to an end, right?
No hard feelings, okay? It's a small place, and I can't get my work done with you around.

## Are you going to be all right?
Absolutely. The world is my oyster. Whatever that means.

## Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man.

## Take good care of yourself, okay?
Hey, it's you.

## Appreciation for what?
I don't know. For helping me out.

## Where the hell do you think you're going?
Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.

## And?
I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood. To make sure I don't run into him again.

## You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?
If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be safe.

## What time did you get to bed last night?
I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late.

## You work too hard, you know that?
Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go. Besides, I'm making up for lost time.

## That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. Saves you money, too. So what's this story you're working on, anyway?
If I tell you, I might not be able to finish it.

## Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
No way.

## Celebrate? What for?
It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.

## Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
I just did.

## Excuse me for asking, but you aren't married, are you?
Absolutely. We would be honored.

## Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that. Would he?
You don't believe me, huh? Look, I'll show you. It's all in this book.

## Is it yours?
Yeah, it might be.

## You have one hell of a knack for getting into trouble, don't you? So how much does it come to?
Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact.

## So you lost the job. Is that what you're telling me? He just up and fired you?
It was more complicated than that. There was a reason.

## Well?
It wasn't my fault.

## Cuban cigars. You mean he had some hanky-panky going with those guys?
I suppose so. He never told me about it.

## If it doesn't make any difference, why not just say it?
I was going to tell him ... but in my own time. In my own time... .

## Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes?
Everything is real in here, honey. As real as the color of my hair.

## I'll take the iced coffee. You only live once, right?
If you're lucky. Then again, it depends on what you call living.

## How do you want that cooked?
Medium rare, please.

## Fries?
Yes, please.

## Lettuce and tomato?
Yes, please.

## You want another one of these, too?
Don't know how long it's take to get a charge...

## Oh, yeh?
Hid it from my mom. Caught a mess a sea runs. Damn thing's still in my closet.

## No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
None.

## ...or from the cut on his hand. Which is more probable?
Him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land. Lived in a picker's cabin at first.

## But back in '34, Japanese-born could not own land. So...?
Carl held it for 'em. Called it a lease. They make payments every June and December...

## In the war. Europe, I believe. They could hardly send him to the Pacific, could they?
And when he came home. Did he write you about this? Or phone, perhaps.

## What do you mean by 'dirty looks'?
Well. Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face.

## When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this?
That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.

## Just three questions. The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500?
Tried to. Defaulted on their payments.

## Second question. What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
A thousand.

## Is that your third question?
It is.

## Now if you wanted to kill a man. Think you'd try boarding against his will, and hitting him with a fishing gaff?
I'm sorry about that. It wasn't mine in the first place.

## So the fishing gaff method wouldn't make sense?
Now the sheriff believed that the D-6 battery in Carl's well was Carl's own spare. Even though it was too large f...

## Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work. So how would he signal for help?
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.

## Well, what if?
Now, how is Miyamoto gonna know in advance? That Carl loses two batteries. Must happen once ever' 20 years or so.

## You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
Happy for him. And relieved.

## So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news. Yes?
We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.

## Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
Closer to eight.

## You thought the deceased might... break his promise?
Of course not. We're just not quick to run and boast. In case something went wrong.

## Up in the air? Was that your reaction?
We discussed that. And decided not to.

## Why not?
Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.

## But if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about?
Trials aren't only about truth, Mr. Hooks. Even though they should be. They're about what people believe is true.

## Did you write that column?
I did. But the jury won't s...

## So. Wide cross-section of men to evaluate. And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration. Did you find him eager?
More than eager. He was out to make a point.

## Well, what then, sergeant?
What else? I had the boy teach me kendo. Including...the importance of the bow.

## And your evaluation of the defendant? Could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff? So quickly, there would be no sign of struggle?
Oh, in a heartbeat.

## And the next one...?
From Carl Heine's boat. All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops. Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.

## And the last...?
Found on Carl's boat, too. Starboard side, second cleat from the stern. But it doesn't match Carl's lines. It matches Miyamoto's. perfect.

## So if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat. With that last one. Would those cleats have lined up?
You bet. And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.

## And why. Is that?
Well, I was a doctor in the Jap theater, in the war. I saw those kendo wounds, many times. Looked exactly like this one.

## Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
Japanese stick-fighting. They're trained as kids, y'know. To kill with sticks.

## As peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound man, and an assailant strong enough to subdue him...that leaves only a single in its wake?
Objection, asking the witness to speculate.

## My gosh, Alvin, was I supposed to object every time you did that?
Objection. Asking witness to speculate about deceased's state of mind.

## All right. What did your son say to that effect?
You're a hard man to trust, sir. You sit before us, with no expression, keeping a poker f...

## I'm sorry, was there a question in there?
Twelve.

## And since you confess this is all pure guesswork. What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?
My expertise. Is that I'm a journalist.

## Were one word of all your fancy story?
No, sir, I can't. Not beyond a reasonable doubt.

## Mr. Jurgensen. Did he offer to buy the seven acres from you?
Oh, yeh. But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell.

## But even after to have seen Carl. Am I correct?
Yes. Initially.

## My apologies. Do you regret not telling the truth?
I have told the truth.

## Well, the sheriff found two batteries in your well. If you left one with Carl Heine, how is that possible?
I had a spare battery in my shed. I brought it down, and put it in just before the sheriff showed up.

## How long you have this detail?
Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch September 16.

## You mean, early morning the 16th?
No, night of the 16th, morning the 17th. We replaced two guys named Miller and Milholland.

## Three kids. What's she going to do?
You said three minutes.

## Here now, what are you fixin' to do?
Have a look. At nothing.

## You gonna climb that with one arm?
You're right. I better use two.

## This tastes horrible, hmmn?
You're wondering why I held it.

## Well, why does it?
Because the second lantern, the one on the mast. Was never found. So we have to ask...

## Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?
Coincidences happen. You run a yellow light just as a car comes out of nowhere. Split-second tragedy happens every day. Or maybe...

## Maybe...?
But you could have climbed up earlier.

## The knife. What knife?
Still a coincidence. Timing and all.

## You think so?
The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely. We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel. Just below the mast.

## Cigarette?
I'll take two. One for later.

## You ever been strangled by a single hand?
Naw, I've seen what that can do to a pack of cigarettes.

## What for, Sheriff?
We have a warrant. To search your boat.

## You always run with the well open?
I was checking the cables.

## Sure you did. Help me with this hold cover, willya?
You gaff with the hook end. Blood's on the butt. Where your hand goes.

## White or black?
You mean, do I like to take the offensive? Or hang back and wait.

## And what's that?
That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said. Gave him the battery. Like you said. Asked him about the seven acres. Like you said.

## And what do you believe?
Maybe the assailant straightened the cabin. And forgot the cup.

## Does it now?
A little. Yes. You have to wonder.

## You found three batteries, you say. A D-6 and D-8 in the well. And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor. Correct?
It is.

## But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there. Why not use that?
It was dead. We had it tested. Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he had to use it.

## Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on defendant's boat?
Two D-6's. That's the kind his well was fitted for.

## So the defendant went out fishing for the night with no spare battery, hmmn?
Apparently.

## I'm curious. The D-6 that was refitted into the deceased's well. Was it exactly the same brand and model as defendant's?
I believe so.

## Is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in?
I don't think so.

## How is your mother-in-law?
She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.

## And her farmhouse...?
The damage was considerable. But she's insured. Thanks, again.

## What else could it be?
Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in. Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.

## So this...foam you found in the lungs. How does it get there?
As I testified. It occurs when water, mucus and air are mixed by respiration. I believe I said that.

## In your motorcycle example. Those injuries are produced by the head being propelled against an object. Rather than the reverse, yes?
Obviously.

## Is it possible?
Sure, anything's poss...

## And death?
For certain, no.

## Can I say something, here?
Absolutely not. Probably one or two hours. Four at the most.

## Those 'dirty looks'. Defendant ever aim one of those at you?
He had no reason to.

## Carl ever say he got one?
I can't speak for him.

## Improved...how?
Mmmmmm. Weeell, you know my old daddy was in maintenance and he had a saying...

## Such as?
Maybe we could run some tests. Kind of a comparison, the old and the new...

## Are these your bags?
Yes. And that one, too.

## I suppose you want a tip?
Forget it, doll. After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.

## Get lost, will you?
That's the way I like 'em - big and sassy. And get rid of your roommate.

## Which of you dolls is Daphne?
Bull fiddle.

## Yes, Sue? What is it?
I thought I made it clear I don't want any drinking in this outfit.

## Funny? In what way?
Now cut that out, girls-none of that rough talk. They went to a conservatory.

## Pardon me, Mr. Bienstock - can I have my flask back?
My suitcase - with all my resort clothes.

## This a private clambake, or can anybody join?
It's private. Go away.

## They wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago - so we'll finish the job here. Come on.
Manhattans? This time of night?

## What happened?
Me and Tiny, we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle.

## Say, Joe - tonight's the night, isn't it?
I'll say.

## Yeah. Why?
Because I lost a filling in my back tooth. I gotta go to the dentist tomorrow.

## No we're not.
Dentist? We been out of work for four months - and you want to blow your first week's pay on your teeth?

## We're not?
First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.

## What are you giving me with the rabbit?
Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.

## But suppose he loses?
What are you worried about? This job is going to last a long time.

## Look at the bull fiddle - it's dressed warmer than I am.
But suppose it doesn't?

## Yeah - where were you?
With you.

## So I had to rush him to the hospital and give him a transfusion... Right?
Right. We have the same blood type...

## All the way to Urbana - for a one night stand?
It's twelve bucks. We can get one of the overcoats out of hock.

## It's a hundred miles, Joe - it's snowing - how are we going to get there?
I'll think of something. Don't crowd me.

## They got the bull-fiddle.
Knock it off, will you?

## You don't see any blood?
Not yet. But if those guys catch us, there'll be blood all over. Type O.

## Where are we running, Joe?
The police? We'd never live to testify. Not against Spats Colombo. Wabash 1098.

## Shave? At a time like this? Those guys got machine guns - they're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave?
Shave our legs, stupid.

## How can they walk on these things? How do they keep their balance?
Must be the way their weight is distributed. Come on.

## With those legs? Are you crazy?
It's no use. We'll never get away with it, Joe.

## DAPHNE?
Tore off one of my chests.

## Polish?
I just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive. There'll be no buzzing around tonight.

## But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water?
Fight it.

## What happened?
I got pinched in the elevator.

## Blow where?
You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.

## What are you giving me with the flying fish? I know why you want to stick around - you're after Sugar.
So you got pinched in the elevator. So what? Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?

## Don't get burned, Daphne.
Me? After Sugar?

## Of course, you're not. I'm going.
What message? What motorboat?

## You're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?
No. I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.

## And where's he going to be?
He's going to be ashore with you.

## With ME?
That's right.

## Why do I let you talk me into these things? Why?
Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.

## Don't give me the musketeers! How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
Tell him you get seasick on a yacht. Play miniature golf with him.

## What are you doing with my flowers?
I'm just borrowing them. You'll get them back tomorrow.

## What happened?
I'm engaged.

## Congratulations. Who's the lucky girl?
I am.

## WHAT?
Osgood proposed to me. We're planning a June wedding.

## But you're not a girl. You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy?
Security.

## Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon?
We've been discussing that. He wants to go to the Riviera - but I sort of lean toward Niagara Falls.

## You're out of your mind! How can you get away with this?
Oh, I don't expect it to last. I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.

## Like when?
Hey - these are real diamonds.

## Get it while you're young. And you better fix your lips. You want to look nice for Osgood, don't you?
It's just going to break his heart when he finds out I can't marry him.

## What are you giving me with the omelette?
Shut up and keep packing.

## Sugar?
Get me Room 414.

## Telephone call? Who's got time for that?
We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.

## Wait a minute - my bracelet. What happened to my bracelet?
What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.

## All right. What happened to our bracelet?
Don't worry. We did the right thing with it.

## All right - so what do we do now?
First thing we got to do is get out of these clothes.

## Did you hear that?
Yeah, but they're not watching yachts. Come on - you're going to call Osgood.

## What'll I tell him?
Tell him you're going to elope with him.

## That's all right. I was afraid it was Sweet Sue. You won't tell anybody, will you?
That's us. I'm Daphne - and this is Josephine.

## Are my seams straight?
I'll say.

## I'm not crowding you, am I?
No. It's nice and cozy.

## Anything wrong?
No, no.

## What did you say?
I'm a very sick girl.

## You got some?
I know where to get some. Don't move.

## You all right?
I'm fine.

## How's the bottle?
Half-full.

## What's the surprise?
Uh-uh. Not yet.

## When?
We better have a drink first.

## Who needs vermouth?
We have some bourbon - lets make Manhattans.

## A bunch of us girls are going for a swim. Want to come along?
You betcha.

## We'll rent some at the bathhouse. How about you, Josephine?
Oh, I have some suntan lotion.

## What do you think you're doing?
Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.

## What's that?
You're so flat-chested. Clothes hang so much better on you than they do on me.

## His yacht?
It sleeps twelve. This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.

## Or was it Bryn Mawr?
Oh, please do come. Don't disappoint us. It'll be such fun. And bring your yacht.

## Well, I'll be - ! How about that guy?
Now look, Daphne - hands off - I saw him first.

## Do you suppose she went out shopping?
That's it. Something tells me she's going to walk through that door in a whole new outfit.

## I know what you need - a slug of bourbon.
What do you think, Josephine? What does it say in your crystal ball?

## Did he get fresh?
Of course not. As a matter of fact, it was just the other way around. You see he needs help.

## What for?
And talk about elegant - you should see the yacht - candlelight - mint sauce and cranberries.

## You like it?
I always did.

## Where did you girls play before?
Oh - here and there - and around.

## Didn't you girls say you went to a conservatory?
Yes. For a whole year.

## What's the big idea?
I'm sorry. I was having a nightmare. Something I ate. I'm not at all well. See? Hot water bottle.

## What's wrong with us?
Help yourself.

## Thank you. Aren't you a sweetheart?
It certainly is delightful to have some young blood around here.

## You invest in shows?
No - it's showgirls. I've been married seven or eight times.

## Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding. You're barking up the wrong fish.
You're not sure?

## If I promise not to be a naughty boy - how about dinner tonight?
Sorry. I'll be on the bandstand.

## Oh, of course. which of these instruments do you play?
Bull fiddle.

## Fascinating. Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it?
Most of the time I slap it.

## Why?
She doesn't approve of girls who smoke.

## Goodbye?
This is where I get off.

## Daphne...
Who?

## Yes, Osgood?
Flower girl.

## Why not?
Well, to begin with, I'm not a natural blonde.

## This is her roommate. Daphne can't talk right now. Is it anything urgent?
Well, it is to me. Will you give her a message? I'd like her to have a little supper with me on my yacht after the show tonight.

## That's good thinking. Daphne's a push-over for him.
Just the two of you? What about the crew?

## Don't I know you two from somewhere?
We're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - Nellie Weinmeyer's car - there's a dance tonight - Come on, Jerry.

## Wait a minute. Where do you think you're going?
To Urbana. It's a hundred miles.

## Now look, Nellie - if it's about last Saturday night - I can explain everything.
I don't mean to be forward - but ain't I had the pleasure of meeting you two broads before?

## Oh?
What are you - a couple of comedians? Get out of here! Long distance? Get me the William Morris Agency in New York.

## You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
The instruments are right, but you are not. I want to speak to Mr. Morris.

## The wrong shape? You looking for hunchbacks or something?
It's not the backs that worry me.

## Well, here we are.
What kind of band is this, anyway?

## You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
Yes, we're the new girls.

## Hey, Sheboygan - you two - what was your last job - playing square dances?
No - funerals.

## All right - lets take it from the top. And put a little heat under it, will you?
We got time off for good behavior.

## If they catch me once more, they'll boot me out of the band. You the replacement for the bass and the sax?
Yes. I come from a very musical family. My mother is a piano teacher and my father was a conductor.

## Where did he conduct?
On the Baltimore and Ohio.

## Running away? From what?
Don't get me started on that. Want a drink? It's bourbon.

## If Bienstock catches you again - What's the matter with you, anyway?
I'm not very bright, I guess.

## Then why did you take this job?
I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more.

## Rough?
You see, I have this thing about saxophone players.

## You don't say?
Men!

## You are?
That's a quarter of a century. Makes a girl think.

## About what?
About the future. You know - like a husband? That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.

## What's in Florida?
Millionaires. Flocks of them. They all go south for the winter. Like birds.

## Going to catch yourself a rich bird?
Oh, I don't care how rich he is - as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste.

## I hope this time you wind up with the sweet end of the lollipop.
Glasses?

## What's happened?
Search me. I mean - I'll see.

## Would you mind terribly?
Not at all.

## Saxophone player?
Forget it, Sugar, will you? Forget about saxophone players. You're going to meet a millionaire - a young one.

## What makes you so sure?
Just my feminine intuition.

## You're not hurt, are you?
I don't think so.

## Why?
Well, don't worry. I won't sue you - no matter who you are.

## Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Not very likely.

## Are you staying at the hotel?
Not at all.

## Your view of what?
They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.

## Which one is yours - the big one?
Certainly not. with all that unrest in the world, I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve.

## I quite agree. Tell me, who runs up that flat - your wife?
No, my flag steward.

## That's very interesting.
And who mixes the cocktails - your wife?

## How's the stock market?
Up, up, up.

## Could be. Do you play the market?
No - the ukulele. And I sing.

## For your own amusement?
Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.

## You're society girls?
Oh, yes. Quite. You know - Vassar, Bryn Mawr - we're only doing this for a lark.

## Syncopators - does that mean you play that fast music - jazz?
Yeah. Real hot.

## I beg your pardon?
You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.

## Tonight?
I thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play.

## Why?
I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out.

## Oh?
It's on the account of the shells. That's my hobby.

## You collect shells?
Yes. So did my father and my grandfather - we've all had this passion for shells - that's why we named the oil company after it.

## Shell Oil?
Please - no names. Just call me Junior.

## Would you mind moving along, please?
Yes, you're in the way. He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.

## One of whom?
Shell Oil, Junior. He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht.

## Shells? Whatever for?
Anyway, you're going to meet him tonight.

## I am?
Because he said he's coming to hear us play - maybe.

## I guess he's not going to show up - it's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot?
It's not how long you wait - it's who you're waiting for.

## Three?
Mother keeps hers in Southampton - and Dad took his to Venezuela - the company is laying a new pipe line.

## Yes - now let's see - where do you suppose the steward set it up?
Oh, you have an upstairs and a downstairs.

## What is it?
Oh - a member of the herring family.

## A herring? Isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars?
They shrink when they're marinated.

## Champagne?
I don't mind if I do.

## Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?
I'll say. I had two ponies drowned under me.

## Where's your shell collection?
Yea, of course. Now where could they have put it? On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.

## What's on Thursdays?
It's the crews' night off.

## You mean we're alone on the boat?
Completely.

## Harmless - how?
Well, I don't know how to put it - but I have this thing about girls.

## What thing?
They just sort of leave me cold.

## You mean - like frigid?
It's more like a mental block. When I'm with girls, it does nothing to me.

## Have you tried?
Have I? I'm trying all the time.

## Nothing at all?
Complete washout.

## What happened?
I don't want to bore you.

## Is that anything?
Thanks just the same.

## I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo Brother or one of those French upstairs girls - but could I take another crack at it?
All right - if you insist.

## Anything this time?
I'm afraid not. Terribly sorry.

## Would you like a little more champagne? And maybe if we had some music - - how do you dim these lights?
Oh, you know - Junior League - charity bazaars - I used to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.

## How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

## Did you have a nice time?
Nice? It was suicidally beautiful.

## Really?
From a rich millionaire.

## Me?
Daphne has a beau - I have a beau - if we could only find somebody for you.

## Tomorrow night?
Not tomorrow, either. You see, I have to leave - something unexpected came up - I'm sailing right away.

## A merger? How long will you be gone?
Quite a while. As a matter of fact, I'm not coming back at all.

## I only wish there were something I could do for you.
You're not?

## Yes, they're here. Oh - white orchids. Would you believe it - I haven't had white orchids since I was a debutante. What's this?
What's what? Oh, that. just a little going away present.

## Real diamonds. They must be worth their weight in gold. Are you always this generous?
Not always. But I want you to know I'm very grateful for what you did for me.

## What's the matter, Sugar?
I don't know. All of a sudden, I'm thirsty.

## Sugar! What do you think you're doing?
I told you - I'm not very bright.

## What'll it be, sir?
Booze.

## Coffee?
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sour-mash coffee...

## Haven't you got another pew - not so close to the band? How about that one?
Sorry, sir. That's reserved for members of the immediate family.

## Who's going to raid a funeral?
Some people got no respect for the dead.

## Go where?
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.

## From who? Toothpick Charlie, maybe?
Toothpick Charlie? Never heard of him.

## Hello, copper. What brings you down to Florida?
Me? I was at Rigoletto.

## What's his first name? And where does he live?
That's an opera, you ignoramus.

## Where did they play it - in a garage on Clark Street?
Clark Street? Never heard of it.

## Why?
Because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them.

## You shave with your spats on?
I sleep with my spats on.

## You and who else?
Me and those two witnesses whom your lawyers have been looking for all over Chicago.

## All right, Charlie - this the joint?
Yes, sir.

## And who runs it?
I already told you.

## That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
I come to Grandma's funeral. Here's your admission card.

## Why wouldn't I?
We thought you was all broken up about Toothpick Charlie.

## What for?
Orders from Little Bonaparte.

## What is it, Spats? What do you want here?
Christ, Amy.

## Why dont you get my half sister her seventh hole?
Bacardi 151.

## Pub Golf?
The wedding. I am so, so bad! I dont think I should be allowed to get married.

## What? Why? What do you mean?
I should get going.

## Are you sure youre okay?
Im fine. I promise.

## What for?
To make sure youre okay.

## You know all that if these walls could talk stuff? Do you believe it? That a place has a memory?
Actually, I do.

## Does Kat know?
Jeffrey told her last night.

## Wheres Nick sleeping?
Im not as square as my daughter thinks.

## Whats going on with you two?
I was pretty hard on her last night. And now shes getting married.

## She did?
So she flirted with Tony, and you got mad and sent him away. Who did that leave? You and Amy. Reunited.

## Whos ever heard of dance lessons for a wedding, honestly?
Um, just about everyone.

## You are taking the piss?
Just because some slags been paid for, doesnt mean youve got to...you know.

## I think I love you, mate. How do you know so much about so much?
Im a hooker.

## I look like a total wanker, dont I?
Yeah, kind of.

## You heading to the train station?
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.

## What?
Theres something about him thats just a bit odd.

## Other than, hes shagging your exgirlfriend?
No, thats not it.

## And you do now?
Nothing.

## What?
Nothing, nothing.

## Sorry, can you give us a moment?
No, I cant. Were late for a dance lesson. I guess youll have to finish up later.

## Yeah?
I have regrets.

## So, whats your point?
I should have told you why I broke up with you. I was a coward. You deserve to know.

## You were so good to me. I swear I never meant to hurt you. We were together what, five years?
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.

## Right. Seven. Christ, thats a long time, isnt it?
Not for a dog.

## I slept with your sister.
Is this supposed to be an apology?

## Im sorry?
Hi. Hey.

## You have feet?
Dont patronize me. Theyve clearly been at this a while.

## The Knicks game? We both wanted the last hot dog?
Oh, yeah. So we split it. You know, as in share. People do that.

## Well, he looks miserable. What were you talking about?
Love.

## What did he say exactly? I mean, you dont think he wants me back?
I dont know.

## What does your gut say?
Youre too good for him.

## Six thousand, right?
On the nose. I tell you what, because youre so cute, Ill take care of our incidentals.

## How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?
That wont be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant. No offense.

## You quitting?
Im desperate to start but I dont have an addictive personality. Except for approval. That, I cant get enough of.

## Who are they?
Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock.

## What?
Its cute.

## What is?
You stand on your tiptoes.

## A weekend?
A wedding.

## This happened to you?
Well, happen, in the sense that I picked up the phone, tracked you down, flew you here and gave you six grand out of my 401K.

## How did you know that was me?
I have a friend at the magazine.

## I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.
Would you grab my shampoo?

## And you thought Id respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?
Admit it. You were disturbed, but ultimately moved.

## Are you asking me if Im gay for pay?
I guess so.

## Theres a guy on 81st and Madison. You get your results in 24 hours. Do you make your lovers get tested before you sleep with them?
My sixth-grade science project was entitled, Love Hurts, The Heartbreak of Human Papillomavirus. Trust me, Im careful.

## I love that youre asking questions, but do you really want to get into all of this?
This is awkward for me. Talking about it makes me feel better.

## Dont stop asking questions, okay?
Okay.

## Subtle?
We kissed. Made out a little. Then you passed out.

## Is this for last night?
Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.

## Dont they have a limit at those machines?
Not if you take an advance on your credit card.

## And what if I didnt want you to...to do that to me?
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.

## What?
Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.

## You have had girlfriends?
Sure, but its never easy. They say theyre okay with it, and they are...for a while. Then one day, theyre not.

## So, whyd you say yes to me?
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.

## What would you do if you weren't an escort?
Make out with you for free.

## Yeah. You?
Yeah.

## Fourteen and hes hoodwinked by a an erector set?
I didnt say he was worth it.

## And thats when he peed in his pants? After the tart?
He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.

## So whats with the nickname?
Hi.

## You have more than one gynecologist?
Sure. Youve got to play them against each other. Otherwise they think youre easy.

## Whats he do anyway?
Therapist.

## You knew?
Im so sorry.

## Give it back? Are you nuts?
You pawned it.

## You want I nut him in the boat?
Yes? No. What? Save the patter for the tourists.

## You want me to let him in?
Its complicated, Dad.

## Shes drunk. -er than me. But I didnt really dump you, did I?
Hard.

## Is there any other way to take it?
I am now, sir.

## What do you say to that?
I say that feeling compelled to do the opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them.

## Hey, Sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party?
Will do.

## You don't live around here, do you?
No, mam... I come from way back there. Me and my dog was tryin' to find my daddy and we got lost.

## Is he here in Borderdale?
I don't know, he's in a prison camp.

## My name is Camille -- Camille Johnson and I'm the Supervisor of this school. What's your name?
David Lee Morgan. My dog's name is Sounder. That feels better.

## You keep looking around, David. Don't you go to school?
Sometime, but not like this.

## It's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this?
Me and Sounder went to this prison camp to see my Daddy and the police guard runs us away and I fell on some glass.

## Did your mother know you were going to see your father?
Uh huh...

## They lived a long time ago -- before you and I were born.
And you say all them people is dead now?

## Where is Africa, Miss Johnson?
Here it is, right here.

## That's where we come from first?
That's where we came from first.

## And the other people you told me 'bout, they is all colored folk?
Colored.

## Here's one by a man that's very much alive.
Don't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ain't dead?

## What's his name?
Dr. William E. B. Dubois.

## What he talk 'bout?
Why don't you sit and I'll read you something he said.

## What about Sounder?
He'll get his place too -- now off with your clothes and into bed.

## Now don't you think it's time you told me all about yourself?
I have a mother and her name is Rebecca -- My father's name is Nathan Lee Morgan, and...

## It was the best thing I ever been to, Miss Johnson!
Because all you could think of was getting away from the guard.

## My daddy likes to look into the dark, even when there ain't nothin to see -- it's what you hear he say.
You could? How?

## You think about your father a lot, don't you?
Yes mam...

## But where is my daddy!?
Nothin'...

## And so you did your job, right?
She was dirty and wet...

## Clarence, would you tell us a story that was not true, after telling us it was?
No, Miss Johnson...

## Can you swim?
You getting the point, Mrs. Boatwright.

## Readin' must be somethin' powerful, huh, son?
Yes, sir...

## He'll show up one day.
We goin' huntin' again tomorrow ?

## Do you think he's dead, Daddy?
Naww -- he'll come back to you, soon as his wounds heal. This cake shore is tasty, son.

## Can you say what camp they gon' send you to, Daddy?
I don't know, son -- they won't tell us things like that -- but I don't want y'all to come here no more.

## Why, Daddy; you won't be here?
Just do like I tell you -- I'll get word to you through the visitin' preacher.

## What's wrong with your leg, Daddy?
Son, that was some trip you went on...

## Where did the sun go to, Daddy?
Into the clouds and behind the mountains.

## Mornin', Daddy...
What happened afta that?

## Where's everybody?
They gone to the field...

## Daddy, when is we goin' huntin'?
I'm real proud of how you helped your mama to keep this place goin', David Lee.

## September 4 -- how far away is that?
I'm gon' miss this ol' raggedy place.

## What's your daddy's name?
Nathan Lee Morgan...

## Mister, can you visit anybody here?
Gotta wait 'til visitin' days.

## When's that?
Sunday...

## Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
Never heard of 'im. We gotta lotta men here...

## Will you help me to find out what camp they sent my father to?
See you tomorrow, Miss Boatwright.

## Then why don't he holler like he usta?
He will... Come on, git down and act like a possum.

## Where did it come from, Mama?
Where all meat come from -- now git yourself washed up and be snappy about it -- you got six miles ahead of you to that school.

## You got two shirts on?
Yes mam...

## Who's winning, Mama?
Nobody yet -- it's all tied up.

## What do they do in the white churches, Mama?
Same as we -- they pray.

## Who is they?
Children, come here...

## Did you see Daddy?
No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time.

## Can I go when the holiday comes?
You sure can, son...

## Any sign of Sounder?
No mam -- I looked all over.

## What is it, David Lee?
No, ma'am... Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.

## Can I go day after tomorrow?
Yes, son. You better get back to bed.

## Did you find your father?
Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.

## What's that you carryin'?
Some books Miss Johnson gave me.

## Who's Miss Johnson?
Miss Johnson is a teacher, and...

## What's wrong with him, David?
It's the heat.

## Tell Rebecca I said 'hi', now...
What's wrong, Nathan?

## Would you like to have a cool drink, David?
No, he was wrong, David, I didn't find out.

## Whatcha got there?
Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here.

## Mama, why did they take Daddy away?
Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.

## Is he gon' be gone long?
Might be...

## I didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, Mr. Howard.
Mama, what was we laughin' for?

## Whatcha wanta order?
I need some nutmeg, flour, eggs, sugar, and...

## Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?
Why don't you pay him a visit, Mr. Howard? He'll tell you all about it.

## You ready to eat?
I'll wait till after the children.

## How's the weather out there?
Yeah. I feel real up to it right now. Come on, David Lee, you and me'll do the loading.

## Is there something I can do to help you?
Yeah, just stay where you is...

## There, you see?
I see, all right -- It's time for us to get out of this field.

## It's a shame, Reverend. It's a damn shame.
Where you goin'!?

## Is that a blessing, Reverend?
Howya do, Rebecca. I sorta been expectin' you this mornin'.

## You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders.

## Will they give him a trial?
Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.

## What... are you?
I am the clitoris.

## I hate the environment.
OF MOVIES What?

## Fuckin' a right.
Eric! Did you just say the \"F\" word?

## But you guys... It's Salisbury steak.
How would you like to go to the principal's office?

## What is this?
They're burning all the Canadian stuff cause of the war.

## Sheet!
Okay.

## Dude, how can you hate the environment?
Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.

## What?
You know, me and Stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck you are.

## Did you bring the pie and punch?
No you guys... Something happened... You guys wanna hear something creepy? I don't think Kenny is dead.

## Goodnight, honey.
What the hell are you guys doing here?

## I don't know honey. Soon we hope. You want it to end quickly, huh?
Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz all my favorite TV shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off.

## If you went down on a horse... You'd tell me, right?
Sure, hon. Goodnight.

## The N word?
Norwegian Ass Raper.

## No, Eric... I'm afraid it's phase two for you...
Wendy, Mkay, if you want to start getting political, I'll throw your skinny little butt right back into rehab. Mkay?

## Eric?
We can't, we're on a hunger strike.

## Ha! Is the Pope Catholic?
I don't know.

## What's going on, Chef?
Something big, children.

## What's the secret to making a woman happy?
Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the clitoris.

## Chef, what does it mean that we're at war?
It's... It's not good children.

## Who are you, kid?
My name is Gregory. I have been Wendy's counter-cousin for some time.

## You stay up here in the attic, Ike. Don't make any noises or nothing, okay?
Boys, we have to have a difficult discussion.

## What's that?
Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.

## What's the password?
Yeah, I guess.

## Do you see them? Do you see Terrance and Phillip?
Dude, we don't have watches.

## What's a butfor?
For pooping, silly.

## What's a dying giraffe sound like?
Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.

## Hey, dudes... Aren't you supposed to go to church, Kenny?
Kyle, check it out.

## What? What don't I get? What don't I get?
I don't know, dude.

## Yeah, they suck.
Hey, Cartman, did they put that V-chip in your head or your ass?

## I'll just try the first one.
Does it say what the clitoris is?

## Dude, do you know what you're doing?
No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.

## Yeah, so what do we say?
I thought you had something planned.

## Sweet.
Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?

## Are you sure, Kenny?
Thank you, Kenny.

## As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.
What is 'fisting'?

## Yes?
I'm needing lunch.

## What did my son say, Principal Victoria? Did he say the S word?
Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.

## What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
It's from your mother.

## I know, Terrance. I know.
My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say?

## I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.
What's going on Terrance?

## Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.

## Who's my cream puff?
I am.

## Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
You know I do.

## What did you do today Satan?
You don't care.

## What if I just left?
Where're you gonna go, bitch? Besides, you know that if you left me, I'd hunt you down and kill you, right? I'm gonna go grab a drink.

## Relax bitch! You're better seen, not hear okay?
Help you? You've destroyed my life and now you want me to help you?! You're always making me feel like a piece of shit.

## Did you see that, Wendy?
Yup.

## Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?
Stan... I think you and I need some time apart.

## What the hell are you talking about, kid?
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.

## Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
My friend the clitoris told me.

## You didn't?
No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.

## You don't have watches?
Dude, you didn't say anything about watches.

## And ze rope?
Check.

## It can't be.
And the butfor?

## Excuse me?
You're Warren Wayne.

## Koros, as in...Koros? Dimitri Koros?
My grandfather. My God, I can't tell you what a fan I am of yours! You were magnificent in Deadly Gamble.

## So, what brings you out here? Pleasure cruise?
Of course, of course...

## Well, so we are. Sure is beautiful, huh?
It certainly is.

## Where the hell did you come from?
Hello second mate Barnes. I was instructed to come to the bridge.

## Weren't you down in the dining room?
I was there. Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors. They are not functioning properly.

## You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?
I did nothing to the monitors.

## And what are they doing now, Mac?
They are awaiting further information.

## Were you going to give it to them?
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests. There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.

## On channel 10?
The device has stopped responding.

## What did you say to me?
It's a little late for you to be up.

## No, I just ran it! Why are you running it again?
Well it's a good thing that I did.

## There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.

## You're certain of that?
I don't know. Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.

## Why, didn't they say?
Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.

## You want to go back to shuttle work?
It's steady, good benefits.

## What, and leave you here all by your lonesome?
Uh...

## Well, maybe I will. You sure you don't want anything?
No. I'm all set. Thanks.

## Barnes, can you hear me, are you all right?
Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking. You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.

## Yes I can transmit the code 3 emergency! I just don't think it's a prudent move at this juncture.
What is the condition of the bridge?

## It's still not going to work! They'll detect you upon re-entry in an emergency vessel!
Uh, that's an affirmative, Roger Wilco. Please proceed.

## We have the codes here. How do you want to receive them?
Well, preferably in tens and twenties...

## Mac, can you hear me? Come in?
Taylor, you surprise me.

## Barnes?
That's me.

## Break it down to me, what's going on?
Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.

## Will do. What about the distress signal?
I don't know. I really haven't made up my mind yet. We'll see how nicely they behave.

## So, what are we waiting for?
That's clear.

## Will you shut up already?
It's getting hard to breathe...

## Yes. Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
This is my second commercial flight. I used to run satellite freighters but that got old fast.

## Like open an airlock by mistake?
Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening. It's usually the moon walks. Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.

## Really?
Still, I hope I behave on the moon. I'll stick close to you.

## What are we going to do?
I don't know.

## Given a malfunction, how would a rescue team get you out if the doors won't open?
Probably come through the wall I suppose.

## I don't think you know what you're talking about. Besides, what could we use for tools? A steak knife? A corkscrew?
Just considering our options... sir.

## Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?
With what? How am I going to interface with it? I need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me.

## Seen one like it before?
I don't know the condition of the compartments. Depending on damage, debris...could be a fatal mistake.

## Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?
We could send Mac. If he can retrieve one suit, we could go back for the other.

## Are you ready?
Ready as I'll ever be.

## You're ready for the real thing?
At this point I'm ready for anything.

## Explosive?
One of Barnes' duds, luckily for us. Take this out of the equation right now...

## What do you think's going to happen to us?
Well, Dawn, I'm an optimist by nature.

## Do you want some advice?
Sure.

## Oh my God. What happened?
The room is filled with poison gas. The hydraulic system must have blown.

## What's that?
A schematic of the ship. Looking for a lifeline to the pods.

## Why? Where are you going?
I'm not going with you.

## What? What are you talking about?
There's only room on that pod for seven. That's you and the others. I'm counting on you to get them out of there.

## But how are you going to escape?
Don't worry about me. There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal.

## Taylor! Where are you?
I'm in the bridge.

## Barnes?
Uh, it's ok, everything's going to be ok...now I'm counting on you, and whatever you do keep calm, we don't want them to panic.

## So what's going to happen to you?
I'm staying with the ship. I'll be all right. Now hurry.

## Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
Hopefully sooner than later.

## Except write our wills.
What the hell are you doing?

## That's right. Will you marry me?
I would, but no one can perform the ceremony. I guess it doesn't matter.

## Is there anything I can help you with?
No, just enjoying the view.

## How is it going to be different from this? Go see some boring footprint under glass?
Look you were the one who wanted to do something different, something to tell all your friends. Any chump can go to Nassau.

## Who are you calling a pig, rummy?
Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.

## I know but we're in a bind.
What makes you so sure?

## Now Mac, can you tell me the status of this deck?
One moment please... one moment please...

## But the corridor outside this door is open, correct?
Yes. You can enjoy some wonderful views from there.

## Mac, what about the suit compartments on this level? Can they be accessed?
I'm sorry. The suit compartments are in a non-oxygenated, zero gravity atmosphere. I'm afraid that's off limits to all passengers.

## How is it looking, Mac?
I would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector.

## Is it safe for human transport?
That's affirmative.

## You're not from around here, are you?
I'm from Akron.

## What kind of man?
A bowler.

## Find your bowler?
My father used to say to me \"Never...\" no, hmmm. \"Always...\" No, no... Ah! Love and hate are blood relations.

## You a mini-golfer?
Nope.

## Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
No. I'm from Akron.

## Where can I find Buzz Fazeli?
Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.

## Hey, cut it out Sid, that tickles. I'm serious! You guys are related, right?
He's my dad.

## Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?
No, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.

## What do you want with old man Faz?
Yeah, basement bingo.

## You afraid we're gonna steal it?
Three whips. To go.

## We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him?
Buzz, Mr. Kastle wants to talk to you.

## Look, Faz, Mr. Kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you... What was that he said...?
You listen to the feelings, not the words.

## Did you know you were parked in the handicap space?
Kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you.

## Theo's bowled on the tour.
Think he bought it?

## We've been partners a long time now, haven't we Buzz?
Seven years.

## What do you think I can do?
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.

## Where'd you get this ball?
It's mine.

## Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to you?
She's my mom.

## Who are you? Who sent you here?
I'm your son. You're a hard father to find.

## What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz?
You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.

## Putt-putt golf?
It's the next level, the next dimension... ...the small ball.

## What's it look like to you?
It looks like dwarf bowling.

## Did that porcupine say he'd get you back on the tour?
I gotta survive.

## You got a better offer?
No...

## What about bowling?
Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.

## So, eh, you never saw me. Right?
I never saw you.

## Thanks, kid. Where are you goin' now?
I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.

## Son?
Millie, please. I don't have a son. I think you better leave now young man. Buzz gestures towards the front door.

## Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?
I found dad.

## You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you?
I gotta go. Love ya mom.

## How's that?
Uh...over easy.

## You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
It depends.

## NO. I SAY KNOCK-KNOCK! You say who's there. I say who's there and then you say who who. You're not playing right. Knock-knock.
Who's there?

## Who's there?
JUNIOR! You're supposed to say JUNIOR WHO! I'm going to have to hurt you. Theo and Junior circle one another.

## What did you do to Buzz?
You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you.

## Do you have to get your hooks into every guy I'm interested in?
Come on Sheila, knock-knock.

## Who's there?
Junior.

## I have someone for you to play with Junior.
Junior who?

## Someone wants to play with me?
I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.

## Someone gonna get kacked, boss?
If Junior thinks you're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap dance on your spleen.

## You know who I am?
I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress. Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.

## It's nothing, just a slight business imbalance. How's Gloria's thumb?
That's some pinfall. Almost a 133 average. Her ball's flat, she needs to work on her spin control.

## What if he wants to get out?
He's earned an early retirement. But enough about losers; Buzz Fazeli is history. Lets talk about your future. I wanna show you something.

## What ever happened to just bowling?
There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive.

## How Mr. Kastle?
You need a sponsor; I have influence. I could sponsor you.

## Why would you help me?
I like you, Theo. You bowl with soul.

## Where's Junior?
Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.

## Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?
132, 154.

## Grasp firmly. Then what?
Line up where you want it.

## Like this?
Strokin'. Here goes nothin'.

## He's no father to you.
I'm sick of you people. Why don't you leave him be?

## Where can I find him?
The Peter Pan.

## What's your specialty?
Whips...orange whips.

## Do those two work for your dad or mine?
Mine, and they never tip.

## Do you know where they're taking him?
Here Theo, it's the Fazeli specialty; a seven-ten split. Theo looks down the lane and sees the two pins standing.

## What do you want with my dad?
Business.

## Won't your father help you with that?
Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.

## Isn't this technically a scooter?
When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild person. Better than any sex I've ever had.

## Where did your brother escape from?
The mental hospital.

## What does he do?
Whoa.

## Mind if I cut in?
No, not at all.

## Can I ask you something personal?
I'd rather you didn't.

## Do you have a girlfriend?
Not while I'm in training.

## No. Do You?
No. Not at the present.

## So this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates?
Unfortunately what he wants is you.

## Do I want you?
We'll get into that later.

## Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl?
I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.

## Why were you suspended?
I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling.

## So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated?
Well, that was plan A.

## What's plan B?
Plan B is your dad.

## What do you think my dad's gonna do for you?
He said he'd sponsor me.

## Ha! And what do you have to do for him?
Nothing.

## What's plan C?
Plan C... ...is me.

## Do you talk with your mom?
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.

## So why do you stay?
I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan.

## How much would you charge me for the lips?
More than you could afford.

## What are you going to do about your brother?
You're here.

## What about the guy he put in the body cast?
Then it's true, isn't it? About...

## It wouldn't bother you if Buzz was in danger, would it?
Nope, I couldn't care less.

## I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?
Why should I help that old fuck.

## Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you?
Zip.

## Way too late. Buzz Fazeli is history. Too late for what?
Nothing.

## You got any broken bones?
No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.

## Why not?
I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders.

## It?
I told him you were my boyfriend.

## How do you get this thing down?
Tell me what happened Theo.

## You wanted me to kill him, didn't you?
If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.

## Are you sure he's dead?
I didn't stop to take his pulse.

## Where are you going?
I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.

## Why did you come back?
You're really pissing me off.

## Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.
I'm pissing you off? I'm doing what I said I'd do. What the hell are you doing? What about your word?

## You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
I'm not dumping you, I'm suspending you.

## Lips still for sale?
You bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw in the tongue.

## Can you change something this big?
Lane's closed big fellah, league night.

## You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
I'm looking for somebody.

## You guys got something going on downstairs?
We provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community.

## Dwarf bowling's illegal.
Basement bingo?

## What are you gonna do, call the bowling police?
You should probably hit the road. Go home. This place could get hazardous for your health.

## Who identified the body?
They're like pink snow, sir. Sticky.

## How big is this spacecraft?
Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet.

## In basic English, what does all this mean?
Basic English? There's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet.

## Any of you get ahead of me -- walk this far up?
Alright, Beth, do that thing you did before.

## How about I just press the button?
Not everything. Even on earth. Take ... yeasts.

## Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman?
The surface ships will be back. After the storm clears.

## How long will that be?
They told me about sixty hours.

## Two and a half days?
A squid? The size of a whale? I don't think so. Target acquired. Sixty yards.

## What if it attacks?
Fifty yards and closing.

## What do we use for defense?
We're a habitat. Not a castle. The only defense we have is High Voltage.

## High Voltage?
It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface. But we've never used it underwater before.

## But you've tested it?
Sure. Each time it started fires inside the habitat.

## What was that?
Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have. This thing is gonna crush us.

## What have you been told so far?
The usual. Plane crash. Survivers unknown. Routine stuff really.

## Anything else?
Nothing else.

## You talk to any reporters? Any press?
Press? No, I haven't.

## From what? What's with all the security?
Well, we don't have all the facts yet.

## Storm? What storm?
A cyclone's on it's way in. I thought they would have told you on the phone.

## How deep is he?
A thousand feet.

## Something like that. That doesn't surprise you?
As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.

## Maybe older --
Geologists?

## Extraordinary, isn't it?
It's impossible.

## What team?
The one you recommended. In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.

## ULF report? Nobody's mentioned that in years. You mean someone actually read it?
But sir, I don't understand. This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life.

## What is it, Norman?
Take a look.

## Picked up something? What is it?
I don't know. But it's something alien.

## What?
If it is alien, maybe we shouldn't try to open it at all.

## Like \"Thou shall not kill\"?
Or maybe, it can't be killed.

## You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
I don't know. That's the point.

## What do you mean, he's missing?
He's missing. He's gone. He left.

## How drastic?
You don't want to know.

## When was this?
81, I think. She tried again five years ago. I thought you should know.

## So you knew this when you wrote your report?
At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break.

## What am I -- a dog, now?
Great, okay. Ask him about his weapons.

## You don't think weapons are important?
I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response.

## Edmunds?
Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional...

## What for?
If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.

## You think he killed Edmunds?
Yes, I do. Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.

## Jerry?
What the hell? It shut us down.

## You see the lever on the green box? Upper right hand corner?
I see it.

## Can you open that panel?
Subs are still at surface, sir.

## Any sign of Harry?
Nothing, sir.

## Fuck him. What? Hello?
Nothing, sir.

## What the hell is going on here?
Yes, sir.

## Well, where the fuck is he?
In the ship, sir.

## In a minute, sir.
Norman, get out of there now! Norman?

## How much damage?
To the craft? None. Not a scratch.

## Right. So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch?
It's chipped.

## Chipped? The door? How can it be chipped?
I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.

## I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?
I did.

## Ted? Captain?
Yes, Harry.

## What?
To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.

## So how do we get it open?
Ted seems to have some ideas.

## So? What's the problem?
It's nonsense. There's enough difference between our own species to prove that.

## Ladies and Gentlemen...
Just tell me worst case. Worst case of what we might find?

## Who is that? Where's that coming from?
Please watch your closest monitor...

## We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it?
... spiralling out of the center, you see, \"G\" is one, \"B\" is two, \"H\" is three, and so on... when I got the message.

## What's the message?
I have to tell you. It's strange.

## How do you mean, strange?
Ignorant. The thing's ignorant.

## Not now, Beth. Please. I want to know who we're talking to before we start talking. Where's Edmunds?
She's not gonna know, sir.

## What?
He's saying, \"Take me to your leader.\" He wants to know who's in charge.

## What -- you want me to retype it?
Edmunds? Get in here. I want to know exactly how this is being transmitted.

## A half a mile long?
The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen.

## What about a crowbar?
What if we go out there, you know -- wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open.

## What are you going to do -- shoot her?
Look at this.

## What is it?
Some sort of lead or something.

## Radiation shield, you think?
A foot and a half thick? That'd withstand a helluva lot of radiation.

## What do you make of this?
We had considered it.

## Considered what? That it's American? How would you think it's American?
Time travel. I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.

## What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
Maybe we didn't want to come back.

## To what?
Internal power.

## From the sphere?
What's inside the sphere.

## Edmunds?
Don't make stuff up, these emotional theories, just so you can feel important here.

## What is that?
The sensors are picking up something outside.

## What?
It won't register. It's too big to image.

## What was Edmunds doing outside?
Resetting the sub.

## Beth, look, can I trust you with a little secret?
I love secrets.

## That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?
To the spacecraft. To investigate.

## What do you expect? For them to bring it up here?
It never occurred to me.

## Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made. Have you said anything to Barnes about this?
The timing has never seemed quite right.

## Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr. Johnson?
Yeah. Drowning.

## Where'd this come from?
The library.

## We have a library?
A bad one. It was the only book in there. Norman, come here, look at this.

## What do you mean -- not normal?
They have six tentacles. A new species. And the squid too. They had no stomach.

## And you didn't tell anyone?
What? Why...

## She was crushed. Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper.
Nobody said... Norman... What? Why are you looking at me like that?

## What could have done this?
Norman.

## What are they?
Eggs.

## So what?
In Edmunds' things.

## You went through Edmunds' things?
He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon.

## You did, didn't you?
Don't do this.

## Beth, I didn't. Hold it together. Alright?
Yeah, okay. Sure, Norman.

## Where are you going in such a hurry?
I have to reset the sub.

## You, me and Harry?
You, me and Harry. He's asleep.

## Four days?
Get the helium out of our bloodstream. We go to the surface now, we'd pop like a soda bottle.

## Why should I go?
You should know how it works. Just in case.

## In case you die, too?
I don't trust Harry to do it.

## You press a button, Norman. It's not brain surgery. Here, go ahead. You only have 15 minutes to reset it. Go on, Norman...
You fixed my suit?

## I can't see anything. How does it look? Still clear?
Still clear.

## You fixed this suit? Beth?
Yes, Norman. I did. You're just nervous.

## Still clear?
Still clear.

## What are you doing in the ship? Beth?
Getting food. We were out of food. what's wrong? You sound mad.

## You get it straightened out?
I think so, Beth. Yes.

## What's Harry doing with your suit in there?
Fixing it.

## Fixing it? But I fixed -- Where'd you get all that?
The refridgerator.

## You think?
You don't believe me.

## You think it's me? You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
I don't know, Beth. I wasn't there.

## \"Our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long. Some skeletons of squids...
What?

## Squids?
Squids?

## He translated it wrong.
Manifested?

## What do you mean, a part of Harry?
When did the messages start? The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.

## But how?
I don't know.

## How can the sphere do that?
Which I told Barnes was attacking --

## But why is he doing it?
He must not realize he is. Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then. He must've manifested his dream.

## His dream? You can't control your dreams. And you can't control your fears, can you?
And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested.

## Why would Harry go back to using a code?
Diphenyl parlene.

## Tarazine?
Tranquilizer. Causes drowsiness.

## Riordan?
Antihistamine. For bites.

## Damn it! Chloramphenicol?
Antibiotic.

## How do you spell it?
P-a-r-a-s-o...

## What's that?
Causes sleep.

## How long does it last?
Three to six hours.

## How fast does it take effect?
Look, it's either him or us, Norman. Another attack, and we go down with this place.

## Thirty years ago. In residency. I passed out. You?
Only lab rats. Here.

## For what?
Not believing you.

## In the sub. Resetting the timer. Why?
The sphere looks different.

## What do you mean, different?
The grooves around the door -- they've shifted. And the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now.

## How's Harry?
What was that? I couldn't hear you.

## What's wrong, Norman?
I'm feeling better.

## Are you?
It's getting cold.

## You don't think I put something in it, do you?
You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.

## Snakes? What do you mean, exactly?
You know what I mean.

## Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
Same reason I put explosives around the habitat. For defense. For the power. To protect myself.

## You think I manifested the snakes?
Someone did.

## You're insane.
C'mon -- what?

## Am I? Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
I never went in that sphere.

## Is it?
Beth, the message said Harry. \"My name is Harry\". My name isn't Harry.

## I'm not scaring you, am I Norman? I hope I'm not frightening you. The last thing I want to do is frighten you. You feel okay, don't you?
It's not me, Beth. I swear. It can't be.

## Then where's it coming from?
From you, Norman. From your mind. You're doing it.

## Beth?
Let's get out of here, Beth. Let's go home.

## Would it work?
Yes. And I think we already know it will.

## How's that?
Pussy.

## What's that -- mistake number two, Norman?
No. I don't think so.

## Well, what's your theory?
I'm a woman. I don't theorize. I only deal with facts.

## Norman? Where's Norman?
By the bunks.

## Pry the thing open? What are we -- neanderthals?
All that banging and pounding. I don't know. We should think about making a good first impression.

## For who? The fish?
For whoever's in that thing.

## It's empty. Why would someone build a ship like this?
You'd have to ask them.

## Then what is it?
It's an American spacecraft.

## What are you looking for?
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.

## Just in time for what?
Our habitat, I mean. This place can't handle another attack.

## Won't make any difference. The tapes document everything.
Another attack?

## When did it come across?
Minutes ago. Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.

## Where's it coming from?
No idea. We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.

## Is it coming from our own computer?
Harry thinks it's some sort of discharge from our own system, but I've seen it discharge before -- and it didn't look anything like this.

## You holding up alright?
Fine. I'm fine.

## To what?
Time travel. A black hole.

## I mentioned it in my report. Didn't you read the report?
Good point. I don't know what you're talking about, but good point.

## I'm completely serious. There is something very important missing from that spacecraft. You know what that is?
Not a clue.

## So what?
So, we know. The called it an Unknown Entry Event.

## Am I?
Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.

## You mean, you think I'm cracking?
No. I didn't say that.

## Then what, Norman?
It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry? Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you.

## What noise?
It's like...

## You remember opening the door?
You were all supposed to leave. You weren't supposed to stay down here.

## Tell me about the door. Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry?
You don't understand about the sphere.

## Page 87 of what, Harry?
I could never read that far. I never wanted to.

## That far in what, Harry?
These aren't half bad, Fletcher. You might have a second career coming.

## Getting anywhere with those?
There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.

## Have you looked outside? Jellyfish. Everywhere. I hate jellyfish. Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
Don't do this. Don't psychoanalyze me. I hate squid. Period. Just like you hate jellyfish.

## What do you mean? She's not here?
When I woke up, nobody was here.

## Beth left?
I thought she was with you.

## You didn't say that about the food?
I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there. Take a look for yourself.

## But why would she -- ?
She's lying, Norman. Just like she lied about fixing your suit.

## Wisconsin?
Navy transmission. They're sent from Wisconsin.

## How do we decode it?
Don't have to. Watch. It'll do it for you.

## What is it?
I don't think so.

## How much time you figure to get to the surface?
Two and a half minutes. Once we're in the sub.

## How far away's the sub?
I can't reach her.

## Get her out of the seat, I need room to sit. Harry?
I'm trying. There.

## You know how to work this thing?
No idea.

## How's that working out, by the way?
Good. Thank you. Now that I have it on. Why are you laughing? You don't even know what that means.

## You mean forget?
It would erase all our knowledge of it. All of our power.

## What'd you say to him?
To who? Arthur? Nothing. Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.

## What does Norman already know?
Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down. Thinks it's a mistake.

## What is it, Harry?
Just one of Norman's many secrets.

## You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?
Easy Ted, we're not mining gold.

## English?
That's right.

## Is it some sort of joke? Like one of those hoaxes?
A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it? Someone went to a lot of trouble. Try again.

## Why would this ship carry instructions in English?
Think about it.

## An American spacecraft? Half a mile long? And buried 400 years? Yeah, good theory, Harry.
Do you?

## Meaning?
Meaning it didn't land in the water.

## Arrived? From where?
Not where. When. 400 years ago. From our future.

## What'd you say?
\"We are friends\".

## Does this mean what I think it means?
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.

## The ships?
They're topside. We're ready to take you home, sir.

## Beth and Harry?
They're in the sub, sir. Waiting.

## Any other bags, Dr. Johnson?
Just that. Careful, it's heavy.

## Captain Barnes wants to see you right away, sir.
No other equipment? Scientific instruments?

## Captain who?
Barnes. He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.

## Really?
By the way sir, I've read your report. I think it's brilliant.

## Told me what?
I'm in psychology. Was. Still am really, just been a while. I treat aircrash survivors.

## You've heard of me?
Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.

## Know what?
Must be another Johnson then. Been flying so many scientists out here -- can't keep everyone straight.

## Who's everyone?
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.

## Geologists? At a plane crash?
Strange, isn't it? In the middle of the ocean no less.

## What the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash?
He wasn't feeling well.

## You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do?
Strange, isn't it? You know -- how it would have a button.

## Like what?
It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation.

## You mean a picture?
Take a look. I rearranged the numbers. Put 'em up to the light. Go ahead. Squint at it.

## Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with?
Well, he's polite.

## You want to put him on your couch, Norman. Grill him about his childhood?
When he uses a phrase like \"I am Happy\", I think we should think twice about what we ask him.

## What was it?
Barnes didn't know. Couldn't get a reading.

## You think Jerry has something to do with what killed Edmunds? With what's out there?
I'm not sure.

## In the closet. I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?
Don't be so supportive, honey.

## How are you getting to the airport? You need money for the bus?
There's a U.S. Navy car outside, Norman.

## Was it a military crash?
I don't know.

## I'm Han Solo, Captain of this vessel. Who's in charge then?
I'm Ben Kenobi. Luke Starkiller here is leading our expedition.

## Well, I've brought you here. What now?
We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.

## Their bases are very well hidden. All the power of the Empire can't find them... Do you know where they are?
No, not anymore.

## Who's going to pay me then?
I think there are some things we should talk about.

## How much do you think she's talking about?
A million at least... If this robot has information related to the destruction of Organa Major, you'll be able to name the reward...

## What do you want with our scan-proof lockers?
Darth Vader is on this system. I can feel him. I can feel the Kiber Crystal.

## Is that good or bad?
It's not good... unless I could find the Crystal. Then it could be very good.

## There is a greater risk in staying here, you know. If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
Sorry, but that was the only way to get you down.

## Oh, so you're a warrior then?
Of course. I'm a Bendu officer.

## Who are you anyway?
You might say I'm part of the landscape here. They call me Ben Kenobi.

## You're General Kenobi?!? The Jedi knight! The commander of the White Legions?
I'm afraid it's been a long time since the White Legions roamed the stars. But I have the memories.

## You saw through me?
You could put it that way.

## Could I learn to feel it?
That is not a human decision, not your or mine.

## A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me.
What do you mean?

## Don't you have a Kiber crystal?
I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...

## Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
They use the Bogan Force.

## We don't have that kind of money. How much do you think I can get for the speeder?
Five, maybe. Let me handle it.

## This is the last place. Shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else?
He's bluffing...

## But she's a member of The Twelve Families. How can they hold her?
These are doubtful times. The Empire has grown bold in its disregard of the...

## What's wrong? What's happening?
Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.

## What is it?
He can't find Organa Major.

## I can't see! How can I fight?
Try to feel it. Use the Force...

## What about the princess?
You go after the princess. I am an old man and would be of little help. I must try to find the Crystal.

## But there was a lot of firing earlier...
Of course, where you been kid?

## But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?
At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.

## You're Starkiller?
Yes, sir.

## Have you been checked out?
Yes, sir. I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T-2.

## Blue Five, does that glare bother you?
I've got it blocked. I'm all right.

## Blue Five, break off your cover attack. It's too late. Make your own run on the exhaust port. Do you copy, Luke?
Yes, sir, but I can get him...

## Should we alert the Sith Lords?
There are only three or four left.

## Where are you taking us now anyway?
The fourth moon of Yavin. I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.

## Did it occur to you they might find us?
We must hurry to the base. We have little time before the Death Star arrives.

## I have little time for your mercenary concerns, but I am grateful for the service you have given to our cause. What is your price?
That's pretty steep. We'd like to talk it over first.

## Who's the pilot?
It's automatic.

## You don't believe in the Force?
Sorcery! I believe in myself... I determine my destiny, not some mystical energy field.

## What are you saying?
You can't! We've come this far. We must find them...

## Why?
Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.

## You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?
I don't know... I've never fought anyone.

## Is he afraid of the water?
I don't pick up any life form concentration down there. She'd better be right.

## What is it? What's going on? Where are we?
You're safe. We've come to get you out of here... Just relax.

## Are there medical facilities on Yavin?
He'll be well cared for.

## And you?
I... I don't know. I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help. I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.

## You've been in the Counter Wars?... Against the Empire?
That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...

## Tell me where you've been. I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars. My father was a Jedi! Were you in many battles?
If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.

## See Threepio... do you copy?
I read you sir.

## You're back. What happened? Never mind. What's going on?
I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir. We've had some problems.

## Are you safe?
For the moment. We're in the main hangar. Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.

## See Threepio! Do you copy?
Something... I've got...you don't.

## Whad'ya talkin about ?
I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.

## What do I want with a scar ?
No, this hurts.

## Rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet ?
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.

## Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ?
Sir, no, sir.

## Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir.

## Do you freely admit to the charges made against you ?
Sir... I guess I do, sir.

## What's the hurry ?
Others are waiting.

## Did you read her mind ?
Don't have to... Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss.

## How do you make him do that ?
I gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom's leg. He is going to go eat it.

## Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.

## Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ?
Eight point... no, uh, seven...

## Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
Elegant proof of intelligence, isn't it ? We thought there might be a brain on P.

## I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ?
I'll take it... until I get killed or you find someone better.

## Are you alright ?
I'm getting better.

## Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
I don't know. It's my last night as acivilian. I ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow.

## Don't you have to finish the game ?
Johnny, this is Zander.

## Hey ! What are you doing here ?
I'm the guy who's gonna teach you to fly this crate.

## Assistant insructor... You must be some kind of a hot stick. Should I call you \"sir\" ?
Only when I give you an order.

## Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed.

## Or...?
They revoke our flight status.

## Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?
Hey, check it.

## Don't change the subject. Am I right ?
Well, whad'ya know...

## Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?
She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together.

## You and me, huh ?
I want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet...

## It looks like an... asteroid.
WHERE IS IT ?

## Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ?
There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...

## So who's got time to get married ?
Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it.

## You're upset, that's alright.
Carmen...?

## Where are you going ?
A funeral.

## That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?
Yeah.

## How do you feel about him now ?
I don't know, Zander.

## I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ?
It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...

## Zander, what are you doing ?
Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.

## Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
I don't want everyone to see.

## How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
It's all I think about anymore.

## Why not ?
I thought you were going to help Carl.

## How do I know if this is love ?
It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't...

## He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy. Isn't that great ?
Yeah, sure, I guess.

## Are you the boy for me ?
I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna sign up for Federal Service.

## Who cares ?
You're right. Let's never stop...

## I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?
Naw, I made it, Carl made it.

## Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad.
Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?

## You talk to Carl ?
He left this morning. He couldn't say where.

## I'm glad you're doing so well. If they haven't made you squad leader by now, I'm sure you will.
Do you mean it ?

## It's alright, I guess. You hear from anyone made it out of B.A. alive ?
It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying.

## Should I be ?
Johnny... Life is so different from the way it was. One day you'll see what I did was best for both of us.

## What's wrong with you ?
Hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch.

## What happened to your eye ?
Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.

## Which way ?
Up. We gotta be near A Company by now.

## Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ?
This is Rodger Young, we're going down... Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down...!

## Where'd it come from ?
Just throw me the ball, Diz.

## Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...

## You still gonna play for Brazil ?
Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.

## Can't we just be friends, Diz ?
Sure.

## What's your malfunction, Rico ?
You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along.

## You saying you didn't ?
Man, they're defended... no way in.

## What ?
High school... remember ? Run a flip six, three hole play, and you might score...

## You used to dance...
What's that, Diz ?

## I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
Well, excuse me, sir...

## Planet P ? What kind of name is that ?
All bands.

## Johnny, why won't you change your mind ? Does citizenship mean so much to you ?
Don't talk like that. Get yourself home as fast as you can.

## Oh, my, what's that ?
Looks like rain.

## This time of the year...?
This came for you today. I presume on your request.

## A trip to the Outer Rings. Whad'ya think of that ?
Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've always wanted to go there.

## Well, it's just good to hear from you. What's up, son ?
It's not really working out for me here, dad. I was thinking... I was hoping it would be alright if I came home.

## Fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... They'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir.
We must be right over the colony. Let's get some air support, eh ?

## They'd rather spend our lives than risk their ships. Who's got the nuke ?
I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder.

## Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?
I wouldn't mind.

## You knew the Lieutenant before the war... What was he like ?
Sir, yes it is, sir.

## No talking please. I'm going to ask you some questions. Please answer all questions truthfully. We'll know if you don't. Birthplace ?
Here in Buenos Aires.

## Are your parents currently citizens ?
No, sir.

## Which do you think is more important, courage or confidence ?
Courage, I guess.

## Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?
Not with an officer, no, sir. The M.I. doesn't mint stupid cap troopers.

## On whose authority, Corporal ?
I'm gonna save Carmen.

## The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?
Uh, I don't know.

## What is it, Rico ?
I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.

## Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?
Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico.

## Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ?
Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team.

## Yopu asked me some advice once, Rico. Want some now ?
Yes, sir...

## Never pass up a good thing, eh ?
Yes, sir.

## What's that look like to you, Rico ?
Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.

## Who is...'V'ger'...?
V'ger is that which programmed me.

## Where is Lt. Ilia?
That unit no longer functions. I have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting Enterprise.

## Why does V'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead?
V'ger travels to the third planet to find the Creator.

## Find the Creator? What...!? What does V'ger want of the 'Creator'... ?
To join with him.

## Who is V'ger?
Yes.

## What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units.

## What does that mean?
When my examination is complete, the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns.

## Does V'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units?
The carbon units are of no consequence; V'ger will determine their purpose.

## A machine...! Then it had to be programmed. By whom...?
By the Creator.

## To join, and become One with the Creator?
To learn all that is learnable; to deliver all collected data to the Creator on the third planet. That is the programming.

## And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?
They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.

## You are what...?
I'm replacing you as Captain of the Enterprise.

## -- You, personally, are assuming command?
Yes.

## May I ask Why?
My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...

## Programming ready?
Program set for standard Warp entry, Captain...

## Explanation, Mr. Decker, Why was my phaser order countermanded?
Granted.

## I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, Mister?
Yes, sir, I'll do that.

## If our Executive Officer has no objections...?
Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.

## Captain, we've seen what their weapons can do. Shouldn't we take every possible precaution -- ?
Mr Decker....

## Captain, what's the next move?
The question is, Mr. Decker, is there a next move...

## Mr. Spock, what would V'ger need to fulfill itself?
That transmitter is a vital link between V'ger and the Creator.

## I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species. You can assure him that's true, can't you?
No more than I expected Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...

## If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
No.

## Commander' Decker?
Our Exec and Science Officer...

## Five minutes to Cloud boundary!
My oath of celibacy is on record Captain. May I assume my duties?

## Mr. Spock?
Impact in fifteen seconds...

## Opinion, Mister. Spock?
Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary.

## Clear the bridge, Captain...?
That was the order, Mr. Sulu, Clear the bridge.

## Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
Also -- there was nothing in your report about why you're here.

## Communicated with us how?
It appears that our message has been understood, Captain.

## Any reply from them?
The 'puzzlement' I sensed was fleeting... minor... ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance, Captain.

## Our... 'insignificance'?
We are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality... yet they cannot understand who we are, or what we want.

## Mr. Decker... ?
No vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude...

## Spock? Concerned about his chances?
I am uneasy with that being our only hope of more information.

## Answers to what, Spock? Our dilemma -- or your personal one?
It would appear that the atomic arrays of these crystals store information. A remarkably efficient system.

## If this is their ship's data banks, where is the crew? Or is their entire ship automated?
Captain, I do not believe there is a crew -- or that this is a vessel as such.

## Were you right? Spock? V'ger is a living machine...?
A life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.

## Child...!?
Yes, Captain, a child, evolving into adulthood -- learning, searching -- instinctively needing.

## The orbiting devices would be controlled from the point, then...?
Precisely.

## Not for us?
No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.

## You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer?
Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.

Well, it had sentimental value.

## You wrote a play on it, what play is that?
You haven't heard of it.

## So young, so unlined, so full of promise. So innocent.
What's it called?

## I beg your pardon?
I quit.

## Why did you quit?
Actually, I'm not sure if I quit. I think that I got fired. I'm such a liar. I never could tell the truth.

## Well. Everybody has reversals. If you were never down how would you know when you were up?
That's good. That's really good. You have a gift for words.

## Why?
It's about life.

## N'about ten minutes. What was your movie about?
No, of course, you don't want to talk about it.

## Ever wonder why the dalmation's the symbol of the firehouse?
First organized fire department was on the border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in the year 642.

## Carla was in the car, right?
I...I think that's right...

## What are you going to do?

Yes, Maude, it is. It is a very good play.

Just him and me.

## If your memory was as long as your dick, you'd be in good shape. How long since you almost went to jail for this shit?
How could she turn on me like that? I thought she liked me.

## You do...?
I just don't know what order they come in...

## I want to tell you something, Wally, he's a pussycat. My you'd do...? What is that?
I think I should talk to my agent, Marty, you and I should, we should, really not discuss...

## Who is her agent...?
Get him on the phone.

I, actually yes.

## You know...Where's your bathroom?
Look.

That's my...

## Will you help me out...?
I...

## How many times in your life do you get a speech like that?
Yeah.

It isn't right. I can't...I...I know I si...I, they, I don't know if they told me it was in the con...

## Forget the contract. Claire. What is it?
I know that...

## Who are these from?
...I can't do it, Wally...

## What?
Nothing. He held her and he wept. Because he...

## And you know what...?
We, we have to give it.

## ...I know, I'm so...because I said, yes, a woman who...the...the community respects...when are we free of them...? When...?
He treated me as if I were a child...

## Bob are you alright...?
I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I can't tell you...

## Bob Barrenger...Bob...Bob Barrenger's in this movie?
That's cor...

## You show Claire these sketches?
Yes.

## Did she throw up?
That isn't very nice.

## Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court. Did she like the costumes?
I can't tell.

## Why not?
She won't stop crying...

## Well.
She Doesn't Want to Bare Her Breasts...what, in the \"Nude Scene...?\" What are we paying her three mil?

## Who got their heads cut?
Uh. Bob Barrenger, fella, Cameraman...

## You said three...?
Did I? I think you're mistaken.

## Where you off to?
I, uh...I'm leaving.

## Aren't you supposed to set an example for people...?
Nope. I'm just supposed to hold people's hands, while they die. What'd you say your problem was...

## ...little woman has gone crazy about our dinner party...City Council...? What's the trouble...?
Main Street.

## What is the...?
Arrest him.

## Conspiracy in Statutory Rape? Okay. Of whom?
This young woman.

## You were in the car with Bob?
Well you guess what. The Mayor sent me. I have your Mr. Barrenger with a history of...

## Oh, you're his attorney, too...?
Later for you, pal.

## What's in the case?
Eight hundred thousand dollars in cash.

You know, the rape, to...even to the accident...

## Who's White...?
The writer.

Sure.

## ...the finest people you could ever hope to work with... You have the new Old Mill pages?
I can't find the writer.

My wife's having a baby...

## You what...? Is that on the callsheet, is that on the callsheet, or is that personal business you?
I...

## Does it have to be an Old Mill? Where have you been?
I was in New Hampshire. I was at the Old Location.

## Halo? Marty? What would they have used instead of an old mill? We need it tonight. Marty? Yeah you were saying...?
I can't write it. I lost my typewriter.

I don't drink.

## Where have you been...?
I can't.

## Why?
I hurt my finger.

## ...she keeps her back to the camera...?
Know? They could draw them from memory. You're fantastic. What a find you are. Get outta here. We need the Dead Horse Scene.

## No, what is it?
I have to tell the truth.

## For what cause?
I don't need a cause, just a lawyer.

## Well, you call him, and call me back, but this is it, pal, you fuck been?
I can write it. I can't type it.

## How do they know that, you told them?
No.

## What did you say to them...?
I didn't say anything to them.

## How do you know you saw it?
I don't know.

## Well, then, you didn't see it, right...?
I don't...

## You were there. At...at 10,35...?
I was walking down the street...I remember, I was writing a...

## What glasses were you wearing? Were you wearing your reading glasses...?
I...

## What is that...?
...the house, the 1835. The original kitchen, of course, burned in 1960, as part of a spate of fires...

## You cool the broad out?
I left that for you.

## That's thoughtful. Ziz good, you try this?
Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat carbohydrates...

## How was your flight?
We're flying over pigs, we're flying over sheep...

They're coming Fedex...

## What's in all the bags?
My undies, cause, you can't get this picture off on time I'm gonna' wet myself.

## How are you getting on with these fine people?
Like dykes and dogs.

## Well, I've enjoyed it, too. Any... any...any time... What does the woman want from life...?
She wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.

## I CAN'T PUT A COMPUTER IN A MOVIE SHOT IN 1895...you wanna tell me how I'm gonna' do that?
Actually, the art department had some ideas on...

## We got the permit.
NO NO NO NO NO, PAY HER OFF. DID YOU HEAR ME?

## Is that one hell of a kid?
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.

## Wally...?
Mmm.

## Is he cool or angry?
Do something.

## Why would they be illegal?
Well, you know, Walt, I just wanted to say that anything I could do...

## ...it is?
I am the City Council. We meet Friday, and I...

## You hear that?
Yes, I hear it.

## You see where Tom Miller's playin' the Old Farmer?
He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.

## Zat true?
Only second chance we git, z'ta make the same mistake twice...

## Where are we?
Givvem a cigarette...

## We need a new name for the movie. Where's the writer?
Wally, I got to takes out that window from the dog. I can't shoot through...

## Why?
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it. You want me to \"push in.\" Or I can lose the shot.

## I don't want much I like chocolate. I want to be a stud.
Ben! What's wrong?

## Excellent point.
So what's up? Who's marrying who this time?

## I didn't say that. Why would I say that?
Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen.

## Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.
I don't want that to happen. Why would I want that to happen?

## Like who?
Well, he's not president anymore, so why be petty.

## What happens when he loves Rachel more than us?
That will never happen.

## Daddy was washing Rachel. In the shower. What did you think that was about?
Sex. Of course.

## Why does Rachel scream?
Scream.

## ...why do you think?
Because it feels really incredibly good.

## So why are you asking me?
I like talking about it. At least, to you.

## What are you gonna talk about?
Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual...

## Then why are you putting on mascara?
I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.

## Like how?
Like seeing the good side of Rachel. So she'll see the good side of us.

## Wow. Who's that for?
Well. It's for you.

## You wouldn't kiss him, huh?
Not with my mouth open.

## This'll work, huh?
Oh, yeh.

## How many devilled eggs can you eat?
Maybe twenty.

## Mom? What's wrong?
Nothing sweetheart.

## And bring my knees up, real hard, yeh?
I don't want to say goodbye.

## Lunch time Sleeping Beauty. Where's Ben? Is he in the bathroom?
I don't know...I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

## See, I...
What if he's kidnapped?

## She still packing for her trip?
I killed my math quiz, A-minus.

## Here's weak?
Honey, she won't d...

## Why don't you say hello?
Annabelle pick up the phone.

## You think this is funny?
No. I think it's ugly.

## Great. Big ears, too?
No. But they stand out, a little. Like this.

## Uh. What is it?
Ice cold water.

## YOU'RE WORSE THAN SHE?
You know, this horse smells really bad.

## I made you some cocoa. See?
Thank you Ben. That was so sweet of you. Goodnight Annabelle. Sweet dreams.

## Are you real mad?
How could I be? We learned some magic...

## IS THAT YOU?
IT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND, BIG GUY, OPEN UP.

## I noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's underpants are in there -- Now where are your lunches?
I knew where I was all the time.

## Does Rachel make a lot of money?
People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.

## What honey?
If you want me to hate her I will.

## Is that like Luigi's?
Not a lot, sweetie. It's a country. Like Canada. Only smaller.

## I'm somewhere, thinking of you. And meatballs. And you know what?
Yes.

## Mom...?
I'm fine, ba...

## Tomorrow? Can I have one butterscotch pudding for dessert?
Thursday's fine...

## I have cancer. Do you know what that is?
Grammy had a different kind. There are lots of kinds. Hers was very bad.

## Is your bad?
So you're okay.

## Where Ben?
Before you.

## Ben where do you have to get to?
Heaven. I have to tell him he's made a mistake. He should take Grammy Martha first. Or Grandpa Norman.

## How do you know?
Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.

## Find the bird cage?
Rache says it's from you.

## So what do you think we're gonna talk about?
You dying.

## So where are you?
Right here. Right here. Inside the magician. Shhhh.

## No, it isn't. Because it isn't everything. And we want every- thing, don't we?
Actually, never. They'll always hate you. There's a gene for it.

## So we'll...radiate some more?
At first. Then, after awhile, some chemo.

## That's necessary, huh?
Let's take our best shot.

## Have you still never told him?
Look, I will send that supply sitters, nannies...

## Are you here?
I'm here.

## You think I didn't get that?
Rachel's not half my age.

## You're WHERE?
Our children.

## We've broken a lot of promises, haven't we Luke?
Called him. We set an ap...

## The great thing about life is that things keep changing.
To make it easier for them or you?

## And we all went through that together?
She's a charmer, you'll see. In fifty years, the kids'll love her ten percent as much as they love you.

## It's good. You're not pulling a mid-life crisis on us, are you?
You want us to take him tonight? Give you some private time with Annab....

## What happens next?
I live or I die.

## Can I please have a cup of coffee?
We don't have any coffee.

## What is this? The Betty Ford Center?
Annabelle, how's your video rep...

## What did you do?
Nothing. Look, I want to talk to you about...well...Luke said to ask you...

## Forgiveness?, exactly?
Luke was in the shower this morning and Annabelle sort of walked in without knocking.

## Of all the cheap excuses. To break a child's heart.
Did you or Luke talk to her about it afterwards?

## Yeh?
Think twice. Before you ever pull that again.

## A court order! Do you HEAR that?
...in.

## Ben likes to be read to. Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
Not personally.

## Do you have a word limit you need to hit every day or can I finish?
Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's.

## What about obsessively picking her split ends?
Anxiety.

## Yes?
When I twisted hair like this it means I'm intimidated by you...

## You feeling all right?
Not great. Plus, I've got things on my mind. You know.

## Let's...hold up for a bit. It may not happen. Our secret, okay?
I don't know wh...

## You WHAT?
You're taking the kids. And moving to San Francisco.

## Really. By what right? Six months of part-time screw-ups?
Life's a trade-off. You get cancer, your hair falls out, but you do get to smoke dope.

## How the hell would you know?
I don't, but...

## How would you know anything?
And cigarettes. I smoke, too.

## Ironic, huh?
Small world.

## Moi?
Toi. They've been 'going out' for two weeks.

## And you said...?
Beats me. Ask your mom.

## Can I look at the pictures?
It's a mess, right now. That's my project when I get back.

## Eat your heart out. Is Annabelle there?
Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...

## How's she doing with Brad?
Can I say one thing? I mean, the last thing I want to do is inter- fere on the Brad thing, b...

## It's covered, okay? I appreciate your concern. Can I talk to her?
Hon, maybe your mom would like t...

## I'm thinking. Do I know you well enough to really chew you out?
No.

## Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.

## You mean, after I'm dead?
Hey, you haven't quit on you, I'm sure as hell not gonna. I just mean, I'm juggling a lot right n...

## And her...?
Took 28 hours. She just wasn't sure about entering this world.

## Is that what he told you?
He won't discuss it. Just calls it history.

## Who in the world is he?
Looks nice enough to m...

## He looks familiar. Did he do a Calvin Klein ad?
Now we're going to have a fight, you and I.

## Now, 'limp dick', I know. What. Is 'snowballing'?
It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...

## You are defending what you did?
Right down to the ground. Let's get to it.

## You think I couldn't figure out some low blows?
You weren't passing 'em out.

## Neutral ground. What's up?
She likes a Stolie, no ice.

## What's this about? Because we fought?
Don't flatter yourself. I always liked that line.

## Come on, a wuss like me? The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?
Maybe I was wrong on that one.

## Uh. You hate my guts?
With good reason. They fucking worship you as it is.

## What do I have that you don't?
Everything. You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...

## So I'll have to order in?
We have the kids this weekend, so...

## For what?
But you're not good at this. Not yet. I'm sorry.

## Why are you taking this out on him?
Rache, get out of th...

## I think so...What do you think?
I think so too...

## Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
Because I can't hurt anyone like this ever again.

## Are you hungry? You could make us something?
They're my kids.

## Great, wallow in guilt, you sure you're not Jewish?
She's not gonna die.

## Imagine my relief. So what's for dinner?
Why in the world would she t...

## Can we go sit somewhere?
Let me put it this way. Hell, no.

## Where you goin'?
I'm gonna get me a drink.

## Does Jackie know this?
No. I'm doing it behind her back.

## In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she?
Something came up. C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...

## What if he is?
He isn't.

## Hey. What's up?
There's something I need to talk about with you.

## What?
There are some rumors...

## Like what?
You know...Stanley...

## He was in a concentration camp?
Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.

## Even though it was only his cousins that were killed?
But that could've happened to him. Or to me, if I'd been alive. Or you.

## Great to be here.
Hey, Scooby! How's it going?

## And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future?
Well, I was thinking...I might work for you.

## Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.

## Do you have any brothers or sisters?
Yes.

## Really? How many?
Four brothers and five sisters.

## Wow. Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two?
It was God's will.

## But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
No.

## When I'm in high school I'm not going to play any football. I'm just going to concentrate on class rank. What did you do in high school?
I did not go to high school.

## Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
We had to work. My family was poor.

## Hmmm. But, Consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything?
No, Mikey.

## But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
I'm always working.

## But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
This is work.

## Consuelo. Are you crying?
No.

## Who is Jesus?
My baby.

## You have a bay?
My grandchild-baby.

## Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?
He's dead.

## Oh. How did it happen?
He was executed. He was on Death Row and then he was executed.

## How did they execute him?
Poison gas.

## Maybe it's for the bestI mean, if he was guilty of doing something wrongPeople who are bad should be killed. Don't you think so?
For rape and murder.

## Consuelo, what is rape exactly?
It is when you love someone, and they don't love you. And then you do something about it.

## So whaddya think?
I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.

## You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?
Yes, I knowBut still, it should be somewhat entertaining.

## I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?
I don't know. Maybe they'll like it.

## Steak's really good tonight. SCOOBY Good.
Mom?

## Got a lot of homework?
Marty...

## Not to be crass, but what do we get out of this?
Don't worry, he doesn't mean money.

## Is everything OK?
My CD case like totally collapsed. I'm gonna have to recatalogue all weekend. Hey. Can you pass the salad over.

## What are you going to do?
I dunno.

## How was the class?
Well...yes. If it hadn't been for Hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave Europe. We would have been...European.

## Hi, Scooby! How was school today?
Fine.

## What's tomorrow?
The SATs, knucklehead. SCOOBY I'm not taking them.

## Huh?
I can read it to you.

## You mean, again?
Well, I changed the ending a little.

## Oh. What happens now?
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.

## So you don't want to hear my new ending?
You'll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me. Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I'd help her with her oral.

## What do you want?
Don't be so upset. It's OK...

## What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
You know he hated my story also.

## And you want Scooby to be the focus of all this?
Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.

## But what kind of pull did you have?
I have a cousin. Very big giver to the alumni fund.

## I dunno.
...But Mr Livingston, aren't you a bit fearful that Scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism?

## What DO you know?
Dad, I'm trying to figure things out right now, OK? It's like, really hard, and I'm just listening to some old Elton John and...

## The same. Same as what?
Just the same.

## Yeah?
We have to talk.

## Whaddya wanna talk about?
OK.

## Dad?Do you think that Brady will ever get better?
One in a million recover.

## You're welcome. Dad?Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.

## Hello, Vi.
Hey, Mikey. You wanna get some ice cream?

## What are you doing here?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all.

## Yeah, um, then...are you alone?
Uh huh.

## Can I join you?
You're not.

## Oh. Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
No.

## It's a really nice place you have. Is the rent high?
Take off your top.

## Any books you like to read for fun?
No.

## None at all? How about those 'underground' comics?
I hate reading.

## Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
I dunno. See if I have any connections.

## Who is this?
Toby Oxman.

## So what's going on?
That's what I was gonna ask you.

## Um, well, yeah. So are you still acting?
Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I kind of came to terms with myself, I realized I had done what I had to do. And it was time to move on.

## Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting?
Well, I went to law school, if you can believe that.

## Anything I might know about?
That's too bad.

## That's good. So then what do you do now?
I'm a documentary filmmaker.

## N-not yet. I'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers. Geez, remember when we were teenagers?
Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to the prom.

## Yeah...So you're um...you're married?
Yeah.

## Huh. Kids?
Yeah.

## How many?
Three.

## Great. How old are they?
Yeah, sure.

## How'd you get it?
It's my Dad's He hides it under some old TV Guides in his closet.

## Is it loaded?
No, I don't think so...

## Yeah?
You know...I like you.

## You want some?
No, thanks.

## Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact.

## What for?
Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.

## Is this to like get into Sundance?
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.

## So where'd you get in?
Prnceton.

## But what did you get on your SATs?
200 verbal/710 math. Kinda weird, I know. But I think they thought it was, like, good-weird.

## Hey, um, Toby? I was wonderingIs the documentary almost finished?
Uh, yeah, we're getting there.

## Can I see what you have so far?
Sureumyeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.

## What is most important to you?
I dunno. I'd like to be good at something. It doesn't have to be TV. I mean, it could be movies...Anything. I'd be willing to direct.

## He did?
Yeah. He went to Harward.

## Henry, what exactly are these crazed gunmen demanding?
Th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash--or Chemco will be destroyed.

## I'll lead.
Twenty-five-million! And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?

## Why? Are we going dancing?
I said I'll lead.

## Just get me a coke and don't argue with me, OK?
I'm not arguing. I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.

## You should listen your old man more often. He's got principles.
Look Cooper I don't care what my father says, if you embarrass me here you're going to regret it, understand?

## What do you mean?
After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me. He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.

## I drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass- ador out of my sight.
What's that supposed to mean?

## What happened?
By the time I got back to the party our ambassador was face-down, in a bed of bloody azaleas.

## Now what?
Because I'll be firing at them.

## Are the labs in operation?
I don't see why they wouldn't be.

## How's the arm?
I don't know. If you gave me a reason to...

## You understand that they're watching our every move right now--you think you're just going to sail away?
I know you're not too happy at this point. It's too bad we weren't able to meet elsewhere, under different circumstances...

## Like where--in your dreams?
I suppose...you think I should thank you.

## Well?
He's in there...

## Who's Ryan Cooper?
I'll let the senator tell you.

## I don't think you--grasp--the situation, Mr. Myers.
And what exactly do they intend to do?

## How much do they have?
He wouldn't take it on the helicopters. He'd transport it through pipelines that connect Chemco to the waterfront...

## How goes the roll call?
We're secured. Takeover team is in position and accounted for.

## What's happening at the waterfront?
We're almost done piping in directly to the Olympia. Should have it all in about an hour or so.

## Our traveler's insurance, you know what I mean?
There's enough in one vial...

## SADE Thank you, Admiral.
SADE Can I have a glass of water?

## SADE The food - you wouldn't put - anything in it, would you?
Don't be ridiculous.

## SADE I have your word, Mister President?
Yes, of course.

## SADE Where are you trying to reach him?
At his office in the Capitol.

## What's the meaning of this?
SADE I am sorry. Sub-miniature photography is my hobby. It's amazing what excellent en- largements you can make from the negative.

## Where is this...thing?
SADE It is buried somewhere in the Grudd Mountains.

## Mister Ambassador, what on earth possessed your country to build this weapon?
That's preposterous! We have no such program!

## Yes?
SADE It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.

## Surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
SADE And surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.

## SADE Don't you dare touch me! What the devil do you think you're doing?
I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.

## Mister President, I can't buy this malarkey; they wouldn't set the damn thing off. Why should they?
SADE You're absolutely right. We wouldn't. No sane nation ever would. That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.

## You mean you'll tell us his name?
SADE It's not a he, General. It was an article in the \"Times\" about a year and a half ago.

## SADE My seven body orifices?
That's right, fella.

## GUANO Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?
I think that just might be it! Although it could be Riki-Tiki-Tavi.

## GUANO What are you talking about, Major?
Well, you can't do that because he's dead.

## We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
Look, Colonel. I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.

## Colonel, don't you know what's going on?
They told me, Major. And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.

## Okay, Colonel. But look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall. Maybe that works, huh? Maybe it'll work? What do you think?
Well, I'm General Ripper's Executive officer. He'll want to talk to me.

## What is your name, young lady?
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz.

## What did you say?
Go back to sleep, baby.

## Colonel, you're not drunk, are you, man?
No, sir.

## Does the threat board show anything?
Well, that's the funny part of it, too, sir. It doesn't show a damned thing.

## May I be stupid enough to inquire WHY IN HELL THE BASE COMMANDER OF THE 843d BOMB WING DID A THING LIKE THAT ?
SCHMUCK To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.

## SCHMUCK Be fair, Mister President. Didn't we initiate the Human Reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons?
SCHMUCK Just a second, sir. He's got films of the War Room in that thing!

## Yes?
Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.

## Under the circumstances, General, what would you think they should do?
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.

## What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
That certainly would be a problem, sir.

## D. RIPPER Why do you think I ask?
I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.

## D. RIPPER Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major?
No, sir.

## D. RIPPER Good. Has the Wing confirmed holding at X-points?
Yes, sir.

## D. RIPPER Yes, Major. This looks like it's going to be it.
Yes, sir. What's up, General Ripper?

## But...what kind of a shooting war? Have they hit any of our cities yet?
D. RIPPER Major, that's all I've been told. Just got it on the red phone. The base is to be sealed tight. And I mean tight.

## D. RIPPER We don't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the President down, do we?
You're right, sir.

## D. RIPPER Are you trying to be insubordinate?
No, sir.

## D. RIPPER Are you hard of hearing, Major?
No, sir. Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.

## D. RIPPER Are you questioning my orders, Major?
No, sir. I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir.

## Sort of like a new hobby, huh, General?
That's right, Major.

## I see you're playing your radio, Major. Isn't that contrary to my instructions for the personnel of this base?
Oh, it's not my radio, sir. I picked it up in the communications center.

## Yes, sir. General, can I ask a question?
Certainly, Major Mandrake. You're a good officer, and you can ask me a question any time you want to.

## Well, General Ripper, sir -- I was thinking -- we're on a condition red, aren't we?
That is correct, Major.

## And a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?
You know the regulations well, Major.

## Suppose that were the case?
But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.

## That about right?
Perfect. Thank you, Major. And now let's drink a toast.

## What shall we drink to, sir?
To peace on earth.

## General Ripper, can I ask another question?
Ask away, Major.

## Well, General -- I was wondering, why are you doing this? I mean why do you want to start the war?
I've given it alot of thought, Major. Don't think I haven't.

## Do you remember what Clemenceau once said about war?
I don't think so, sir.

## Well, I think I remember reading the report on that. Wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?
That's close enough, Major.

## I suppose we might catch them off their guard.
But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?

## Our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy, wouldn't they?
I guess so.

## Where, sir?
Where? Everywhere, Major. Everywhere.

## You're very naive, Major. Don't they say they want disarmament?
Yes, sir. But so do we.

## But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
Right.

## That's right, sir. And don't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb. What if they start something?
Go on, Major. You fascinate me.

## Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
No, Major, I don't. They have no regard for human life. They wouldn't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won.

## Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
But, General, we're on our toes. We haven't agreed to anything for years. Inffact, a a lot of people say we never will.

## But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?
If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.

## And you'd like to see that?
General, what's good enough for the President and all the experts he's got working on the thing, is good enough for me.

## Do you think we'd cheat?
No, sir. I'm sure we wouldn't.

## Do you think they would cheat?
Major, I hate to say this, but I think you've been enemy indoctrinated, and you don't even know it.

## Yes, sir. Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
To peace on earth, Major.

## I presume the planes are armed?
I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.

## Well, what about the Positive Control, the safety catch? Don't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order?
That's right, sir. But the planes were at their Positive Control points, ready to turn around when General Ripper issued the final Go-code.

## What the hell is Plan-R?
Well, sir, Plan-R is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.

## Why can't you cancel it?
And I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know what the three-letter code is.

## How soon until the enemy finds out what's going on?
We estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twenty-five min- utes.

## Then there's no chance for recall?
General Jack D. Ripper, sir.

## Admiral Buldike?
They're coming in now.

## How long will it take to receive them all?
I'm not certain, Mister President. The boys in CONCOM do the pencil work.

## How many planes did we lose?
I'm not certain, Mister President. But I believe it was four.

## General Schmuck, are you positive of your figures?
Naturally I am, sir.

## Yes?
Well, sir, it looks like one aircraft, the \"Leper Colony\", failed to receive the recall.

## Have you tried the recall again?
Yes, sir. We're still sending it. But it's a funny thing we don't seem to be able to make any contact with the aircraft at all.

## Is there any chance a single aircraft can penetrate the entire enemy Air Defense, when its course and target are known?
General, stick to the point, please.

## Thanks, Binky. Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
I don't think so.

## What else could it be?
Maybe it's an exercise.

## What?
War.

## War?
I'm sorry, Major Kong. I guess I was way out of line.

## Speed?
Between Mach 3 and 4.

## Come on, Quentin, isn't that pretty selfish, putting yourself ahead of the mission?
Look, I'm shot - it hurts.

## Look, can't someone help me?
Roger.

## Yeah?
I just got another blast on the CRM-114, and the damned thing decodes, Wing Attack, Plan-R.

## Lieutenant Toejam, are you ready for Bim and Bam?
Ready, Major.

## Lieutenant Toejam's going to help you in a minute. Can you check your ECM?
So am I.

## What does it look like?
Some kind of signaling.

## Our targets are a missile complex and an airfield - not cities, right?
That's what I said.

## Are you saying our order don't make sense?
Hellnno, Major. I was just trying to think the thing through.

## As soon as I've checked over the route. About five minutes. All right?
Primary circuit is live.

## Let's have a rundown on the damage, Lothar?
Everything still checks out okay.

## Binky?
Yes, Major.

## Can't \"Ace\" help you?
He's dead.

## I bit his jugular vein. Now will you shut up and get up here?
Sure! Sure, I'm on my way.

## Where'd they get you?
In the back...feels like an arrowhead.

## How do you know he's dead?
Hell, he looks dead.

## No, I think it means, \"Recall period Mistake,\" and the OPE is probably the CRM-114 code. Terry?
You sure have to hand it to those guys.

## What do you mean?
I mean pulling a stunt like that.

## What do you mean?
Well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.

## Wait a minute, Major. \"OPE,\" that's the recall code. Where would they get that?
You tell me.

## Why should they call us back?
How the hell do I know? Maybe the war's over.

## Lieutenant Zogg, what do our orders say about the authentication of orders during an attack mission?
Look, this is different.

## Then that settles it, doesn't it?
Like hell it does.

## Right. So how could we get any messages?
That's the point.

## Lieutentant Zogg, how would you like your black butt slung into a General Court Martial when we get back?
Take it easy, Major Kong.

## Nobody's loyalty is beyond question. Besides, how do we know one of his staff didn't see it?
Come on, King. That doesn't make sense.

## We crossed the coast over an hour ago. Okay?
You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball.

## I'm okay. What's up?
Well, I hate to say this, but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.

## Are you sure?
Well, I can't get out and look, King. But I don't get a green light.

## Have you tried the emergency system?
I tried everything. Something must have gotten bent or twisted from the pounding we took.

## Lothar, can you arm the bombs for impact?
Let me check.

## Would it matter if they hit at a flat angle? I mean, do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger?
Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.

## What the hell are you doing here, Lothar?
I thought I'd go along for the ride.

## Now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for, Lothar?
I thought maybe you'd like some company.

## King, would you mind if I keep me hands on the wheel when you take her in?
I'd be mighty proud if you did, Lothar.

## Listen, Lothar. You know that crack I made about your...butt?
Forget it.

## At the bottom of mines?
Yes. The radioactivity could not penetrate a mine some thousands of feet deep.

## Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.
Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.

## Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
I don't know.

## We are?
Alright. She told him to meet us here. Fuck.

## \"Burger Manifesto, Part One\" is gonna make people think?
Um-hm.

## Can I have some?
Knock yourself out.

## Did you ever hear that saying, \"This too shall pass\"?
Sure, all the time, in Group.

## In Group?
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.

## How long were you in there?
Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go once a week. See, I'm rehabilitated.

## Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.

## It was pretty bad, huh?
Yeah.

## What did you guys think?
Slides go with it.

## Why is everything about you, Jeff?
Uh-huh.

## Tim, he listens to you. Do you think it's a good idea? Seriously?
Uh, home, you know.

## Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
No I quit.

## Hey, you said you did a video?
Yup.

## What's it about?
It's really not about anything.

## Oh. Well, what's it on?
A cloud.

## A cloud?
Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.

## You can see it. Whenever you want. Don't you, um, work at a hospital or something?
Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.

## Your a nurse?
No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.

## Any gunshot victims?
Sounds like a bummer.

## Right now?
Yeah.

## Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay.

## Where are you-hoo?
No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the tickets.

## Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
Shut up! Aw...

## You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy?
No, uh, nobody. It's, uh, it's my birthday this week and Sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday.

## It's your birthday?
Pony's coming here to the corner?!

## You wanna bet he's with a girl?
No, he's not with a girl.

## Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?
I'd get bored.

## That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
That sounds so depressing.

## So, do you guys want to do something, go someplace or something like that?
So, we're all old friends of Pony's. We go way back to our childhood.

## Hey! Whoa, you look like shit. You been home yet?
No, no.

## Hey. Hey. Are you trying to get a hold of Sooze?
No.

## Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze?
No, no, I wasn't trying.

## Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?
Sure.

## Okay, Buff, listen to me for a second alright?
No, I know what you're going to say. I don't know anything about making a video. But that's a plus.

## Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
Oh, and guess who showed up.

## Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night?
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.

## What?
Look.

## What she doin' in the van, man?
Buff...

## What?
She's dead.

## She's dead?
Look, Tim confessed to me last night.

## Oh, really? You wanna go look?
Yeah, man.

## Ah, you know people there?
I'm just gonna go. I figure the worst I can do is starve to death.

## Really?
You know, I should, um, make a video of this place. You know, bring the camera in.

## Oh, Pony's band \"Dream Girls\"? Been on the road opening for \"Midnight Hore\". Stadiums, man. Wait, so Pony's coming by here?
Hey! On behalf of Burnfield, I present to you the keys to the city.

## So, how was the ride, kids?
Great.

## Really?
They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun.

## Oh, you were in the band?
Yeah.

## Your his publicist?
Sure I am. It's fun.

## What do you mean? His girlfriend?
Well, that's one way of putting it.

## Am I fucking him?
Shit.

## I'm so burnt-out.
Pony, what would you say our relationship is?

## Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
Playing with something really hot. Yeah.

## Oh, my God, you found it. Thank you so much. Did you get your tape?
Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig.

## Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself.
I can come visit?

## Are you talking to me?
No, but I heard it was great.

## So tell us, man. Party time, trashin' hotel rooms, babes around the clock?
Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.

## Oh, So what about her?
Yeah, we're all above that.

## Thanks. See man?
You know? I remember coming here with my parents.

## You make videos?
Oh, yeah, all the time. That's what I do now.

## You okay, man? You okay?
I didn't want to eat this much, man.

## Uh, you know, just admiring the scenery, you know?
You were a shitty lineman and now your a shitty cop. Yeah, blow me, I'm drunk.

## Will you stand up for me?
Okay.

## Yeah, totally. So, uh, what do they interview you about?
Hi.

## So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
No, not really. I come from an \"area\". Bel Air.

## You rich?
No, not really. Middle-class.

## He is?
Yes.

## What'd he get you?
A Porsche.

## Yeah. So, what about you?
What about me? I don't have a car.

## You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?
Military marching bands.

## Oh, yeah?
Mm-mm.

## Really?
Mm.

## You cut off your little finger?
Well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it back on.

## Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?
Deep down. Way down.

## Yeah?
No, no, see, you, you don't understand.

## He says we got to be at the radio station at seven a.m. Can you handle that?
Oh, sure.

## We were?
Oh, yeah, it was a great show. You guys missed it.

## Erica, you coming?
Mm-mm.

## Two-fifty? They go up?
Always two-fifty, my friend.

## Can you tell me what happened?
He's drunk.

## If it's all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead?
Because I'm alienated.

## Who were you talking to?
Nobody. Sooze.

## Oh, no, you wanted to get together with your close friend, Pony, the rockstar. I understand. So you, do you, want us to, leave?
No. We were just gonna go someplace or something to...

## No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying I don't need a limousine to know who I am, alright?
Right on. You know what? He doesn't need the limo, man.

## Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
Oh, shut up, Tim. This isn't funny, man.

## Tim, what are you talking about?
Ask your girlfriend.

## What? Oh, come on. You're not gonna suck my cock?
I'm not suffering, you know. I don't give a shit.

## Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em. You know what I mean?
Yeah, fuck 'em.

## What'd you do?
I hit her.

## You hit her? Oh, wait, wait a minute. Why'd you hit her?
Because I was fucked up, man. I just kept hittin' her till she didn't move anymore.

## Wait a minute, wait a minute. She's unconscious?
Go look, man. Go look. Go see for yourself, if you got the guts.

## They let you out?
You lied to me.

## Wow. You did that for me?
Yes.

## Why? Because I give a shit?
Oh, shit.

## Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?
Oh no, no. You know what? Fuck that. No, you lied to me. You lied to me because you're gutless. You're a gutless, drunken looser.

## Hey, you saw that brown bitch point a gun at me last night, man. Did you think she was gonna use it?
I don't know.

## You don't know?
No.

## Come on. You don't think that after they called the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh?
No.

## Just go home, alright?
This is my home.

## Will you just put the gun down?
No.

## That, that's Indian?
Seven-twenty.

## Oh, it's very complicated, huh?
That's right.

## Look, why do you care, huh?
Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.

## Please?
Look, look, just get off my property.

## This has nothing to do with me! She went up by herself. Yeah I tell them don't go on the roof! They can't go on the roof! How is she?
I don't know. I think she's breathing.

## Was that supposed to be me?
No.

## Man?
Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am.

## No, no. It's an honest question. What are you trying to communicate?
I'm trying to communicate how I feel, Jeff. You know raise consciousness. Make people think for a change.

## About what?
About things that are important to me.

## Like what?
Sexual politics, racism, the environment, the military industrial...

## You know, all you know is what's good for you.
But do you stand for anything?

## Can I talk?
Typical male.

## Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play?
Um, because you didn't want to go.

## It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?
It got that close.

## Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

## How?
Jeff. Jeff.

## What feelings?
Us.

## And?
Come with me.

## So what do you wanna do?
Nothing.

## New ground?
Mm-hm.

## Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
My goal is to make art.

## Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
Mm-mm.

## So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
No, no.

## So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?
Come on.

## What?
No, I mean it. No, look, when, when I got out of the car I walked all the way here.

## Oh, yeah?
I, yeah.

## Wait, wait, wait a minute, Sooze. What are you doing?
I'm leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I have your permission? Maybe you want to think about it.

## Where are you going?
For a ride.

## Wait, away?
Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.

## I've run out of words.
To his hotel?

## Wait. What, what are you saying?
I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.

## Well, what about us?
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.

## Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?
Oh, no, no, no.

## What?
Just go.

## You really suck, you know that?
Just go.

## Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
Good, man.

## Well, shit, man, you've only been gone for a year, man, Is that your limo?
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just...

## Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.

## Wow. A gold record, man, that's great. So you're, you're like living the wild life now, huh?
Nah, nah, nah, nah.

## Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
Yeah.

## Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?
Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets.

## So how's college?
You know, I've thought about that, actually.

## What?
Write. 'Cause I, I have written some things.

## Like songs?
Yeah, they could be songs.

## Really?
Yeah, really.

## Now?
Yeah.

## So, um, Pony, where are you staying? Are you staying at your mother's house?
No, no, they, uh, you know, that can be kind of a hassle, so , uh, you know, I just stay at the Four Seasons. It's easier.

## Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.

## Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?
Of course it does.

## You know what I'm saying?
No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.

## George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?
No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.

## I gotta take a piss. Do you mind if we pull over really quickly?
Oh, yeah.

## Hey, where's Erica?
I don't know.

## Well, you gotta call your wife then, you know, 'cause she kind of handles these heavy matters anyway, right?
No. No, you see, I don't have to call my wife.

## Well, what about this?
What about this, huh? Go ahead, big man.

## Look Pakeesa...
Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?

## Look; okay, come on. Look, what are you doing? Look, that's enough. My wife called the police. They're coming.
Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened?

## Oh, it's stupid, isn't it.
Ready?

## Is that your driver?
Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances.

## So? What's L.A. like?
It's pretty exciting.

## Yeah?
Yeah.

## Like?
Oh, uh... uh, the other night our manager Danny took us to this restaurant and there was Sandra Bernhard.

## New York, huh?
Yeah. To go to school and, you know, paint, performances, paint.

## Yeah, so what do you guys do next? I mean, what's your band do now?
Oh, uh, we're gonna go in the studio and we're, we're doin' a new album.

## Yeah?
Yeah, and I was thinking, Sooze, you could do the cover.

## Would I get paid?
Yeah, we'd have to fly you out for meetings, you know.

## Yeah?
Yeah.

## Hey, man, uh, look, if you don't like my stuff, uh, I won't sing it, okay? I'm sorry, you know?
Yeah. Burnfield, Pizza and Puke capital of the world.

## What's that supposed to mean?
I don't know. I say what I mean.

## Me?
Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.

## Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?
Yeah, I know what you're saying.

## You do?
Yeah. God, you showed up at such a weird time in my life.

## You know, my mom has this saying.
Is that Jeff?

## Tim, why don't you shut the fuck up?
I think I gotta go.

## So, like, your dad's a big deal, right?
Uh, I didn't write any songs. You guys go ahead. I gotta stay here and guard the parking lot.

## Where's Erica? You seen her?
Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel.

## I called Bucky's. I got her a cab. Is there any hot mustard?
Well, I called Erica's beeper. There's just no answer.

## About where she went. I mean, what bar?
She didn't say. Maybe she's at the bar at the hotel.

## The bar at the hotel? She told you that? What did she say exactly?
Well, Dad, she said she wanted to suck my cock.

## It's none of my business?
Yeah.

## What are you going to do? Hm?
If you hit me...

## Your manager?
Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.

## Just one?
Yeah.

## I don't, I don't remember. What do I owe you?
Uh, eleven twenty-five.

## So where are you?
I'm here.

## At least I have a point of view, you know?
Seriously? It's a great idea.

## Why don't you go back to where you came from?
Hey, Tim.

## You have the largest penis. Can we go please?
Hey, your gonna regret this.

## Could you give me a ride?
Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.

## The fuck not?
You know the fuck not.

## Another sex dream?
Hee-hee-haaaa-weee worked it out. Heee hee-haaa....

## My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?
I personally think of how Conan started as a writer, then became a...

## Hello?
Di? I just called to say that Conan talked about us again last night.

## You sure?
C'mon, Luce, people do it in the movies all the time.

## If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?
... I don't know. Probably not.

## WHAT?! That's insane!!! Why would I go to the police?
I've got to get that. Relax. I'll see you tomorrow.

## Spit from your dad?
I see a flower. And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.

## Y'think?
I sure do.

## If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?
Trix...

## Oh... What are you working on?
Jus some girlie things for the squad.

## Hat-trick?
He is the Great One...

## \"No\" you're not sure or \"No\" I'm not fat?
Uh, \"no\"... You're not fat.

## You sure I'm not fat?
Listen, Kansas, I know you dream of springing your mom some day...

## Hee-hee-h-wait a minute. Hold on, now. What do we do before a big game?
Oh no...

## That you?
Yeah, hold on.

## CHARLIE Kim-Lo?
I guess there's an exception to every rule.

## Ammo?
Bullets.

## ... Ja-ck B-ar-t-le-tt... Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?
I-I didn't mean to say \"whore,\" Diane. I just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my head.

## Look, maybe I can watch a PG movie... I'll just say I'm counting dirty words for Sunday School.
You want us to help you pick up?

## Hello?
Shit! Yeah, Grandma. Me and the squad.

## Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?
Oh yeah, you caught us...

## You got that big retarded girl down there?
Uh...Yeah, Grandma. She doesn't mean that. Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.

## Then I'll throw a few more treats on the plate. Where's my smokes?
I'll get them before \"Touched by an Angel,\" don't worry.

## She did, did she? How is the old girl?
Definitely old.

## I don't hate you. I need your help.
That's Itchy, alright. How many y'need?

## My what?
Your help.

## Now how the hell can I help you?
Okay, you can't tell anybody.

## Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk. Whaddya want?
My best friend got pregnant.

## What the hell do you want?
I want to help. I'm part of this squad...

## It must be about that appalling script of hers. What can I say to her? What can I say?
I can tell her you're all tied up in the projection room. I can give her the brush ...

## Hi, Artie.
Listen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough?

## Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?
In a deep freeze.

## You're going to stay, aren't you?
That was the general idea.

## Judas E. Priest, who did you borrow that from? Adolphe Menjou?
Close, but no cigar.

## Where's the bar?
Good party.

## Listen, Artie, can I stick around here for a while?
Sure, this'll go on all night.

## I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.

## Wait a minute. This is the woman I love. What's going on? Who was loaded?
Don't worry. She's just a fan for my literary output.

## I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?
Someone in the formal set, no doubt, with a ten-carat kidney stone.

## What's wrong with it?
It's from hunger.

## Nothing for Ladd?
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.

## Exactly what kind of material do you recommend? James Joyce? Dostoosvsky?
Perhaps the reason I hated Bases Loaded is that I knew your name. I'd always heard you had some talent.

## About that luggage. Where's the phone?
You forgot this.

## What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?
I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.

## Dark Windows. How did you like it?
I didn't.

## How about the Rainbow Room?
Now if I got you correctly, there was a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice.

## Who wants true? Who wants moving?
Drop that attitude. Here's some- thing really worth while.

## As for instance?
Well....

## You won't. I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
We could make some paper boats and have a regatta. Or should we just turn on the shower?

## You'll be waiting for me?
With a wildly beating heart.

## Is that so? What's the wonderful news?
Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.

## What teacher?
Dark Windows. I got him all hopped up about it.

## You did?
He thinks it could be made into something.

## Into what? A lampshade?
Into something for Barbara Stan- wyck. They have a commitment with Barbara Stanwyck.

## O.K. Where's the cash?
Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work.

## Why should you do that?
If you get a hundred thousand for it, you buy me a box of chocolate creams. If you get an Oscar, I get the left foot.

## What about all those ideas you had?
See if they make sense. To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind.

## It will?
Sure. Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.

## Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
Constantly. No, in all serious- ness, it's really good. It's fun writing again. I'm happy here, honest I am.

## Who's who?
I'm sorry. I don't usually read private cigarette cases.

## Second generation, huh?
Nice job.

## That's no shampoo. It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile. How old are you anyway?
Twenty-two.

## Hey, what's the matter... Betty, wake up! Why are you staring at me like that?
Was I? I'm sorry.

## What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
Something came up. I don't want to talk about it.

## Why not?
I just don't.

## From Artie. What's wrong?
He wants me to come on to Arizona. He says it only oosts two dollars to get married there. It would kind of save us a honeymoon.

## Why not? Don't you love Artie?
Of course I love him. I always will. I'm just not in love with him any more.

## What happened?
You did.

## Come on in, Betty,
I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe. Is it something awful?

## This is where you live?
You bet.

## Whose house is it?
Hers.

## Whose?
Just look around. There's a lot of her spread about. If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.

## That was Norma Desmond on the phone?
Want something to drink? There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.

## Why did she call me?
Jealous. Ever see so much junk? She had the ceiling brought from Portugal. Look at this.

## I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?
No.

## Come on where? Back to a one-room apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?
If you love me, Joe.

## That's no excuse. You read the script, didn't you?
Yes, I did.

## What assistant?
Don't play innocent. Somebody named Gordon Cole.

## Gordon Cole?
And if you hadn't been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the phone ten times.

## Did you see them? Did you see how they came?
You know, crazy things happen in this business. I hope you haven't lost your sense of humor ...

## What's the matter, Norma?
Nothing. I just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio. I had no idea how I'd missed it.

## It's a good script, isn't it?
It's got a lot of good things. Of course, it would be an expensive picture...

## Or shall I call my servant?
You're a writer, you said.

## Are you or aren't you?
I think that's what it says on my driver's license.

## And you have written pictures, haven't you?
Sure have. The last one I wrote was about cattle rustlers. Before they were through with it, the whole thing played on a torpedo boat.

## How long is a movie script these days? I mean, how many pages?
Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.

## Who else ?
This is fascinating.

## Who? I'd have to have somebody I can trust. When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
I don't know.

## What month?
The name is Gillis. I'm single.

## Where do you live?
Hollywood. The Alto Nido Apart- ments.

## What's that?
Just a scene I cut out.

## Cut away from me?
Honestly, it's a little old hat. They don't want that any more.

## Now what is it? Where's the fire?
I've lost my car.

## Why begrudge me a little fun? I just want you to look nice, my stray little boy.
What's wrong with It?

## How about some evening clothes?
I don't need a tuxedo.

## Joe, you look absolutely divine. Turn around!
You'll need them for parties. You'll need them for New Year's Eve. Where are your evening clothes?

## Cute. Let's have some drinks.
Come on!

## Shouldn't we wait for the others?
Careful, it's slippery. I had it waxed.

## The other guests?
There are no other guests. We don't want to share this night with other people. This is for you and me.

## Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?
You think this is all very funny.

## What's that?
I'm in love with you. Don't you know that? I've been in love with you all along.

## Cut out that us business.
What are the notes?

## What you're trying to say is that you don't want me to love you. Is that it?
Go away.

## What kind of a silly thing was that to do?
This is the right day.

## Did she read the script?
I hope you realize, Norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.

## When did he say it, Norma?
Have one of mine.

## Where are your...?
Nothing is the matter. I'm having a great time. Show me some more.

## Don't you want to come along, darling?
I don't think so. It's your script. It's your show. Good luck.

## How did it go?
It couldn't have gone better. It's practically set. Of course, he has to finish this picture first, but mine will be his next.

## I just happen to know it. I had a nightmare and I screamed for you. You weren't here. Where were you?
I went for a walk.

## All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house?
I haven't done anything, Norma.

## What are you doing, Joe? What are you doing? You're not leaving me?
Yes, I am, Norma.

## These are nothing. You can have anything you want if you'll only stay. What is it you want -- money?
Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more.

## What about the studio? What about De Mille?
He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.

## Wanted what?
De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you. None of us has had the heart.

## You are not dressed properly.
That isn't true! Max?

## I made your bed this afternoon.
Dressed for what?

## Thanks. How did you know I was going to stay, this afternoon?
Some men are here. They asked for you.

## Whose room was this?
It was the room of the husband. Or of the husbands, I should say. Madame has been married three times.

## How come?
The doctor suggested it.

## What doctor?
Madame's doctor. She has moments of melancholy. There have been some suicide attempts.

## Uh-huh?
We have to be very careful. No sleeping pills, no razor blades. We shut off the gas in her bed- room.

## You send them. Is that it, Max?
I'd better press your evening clothes, sir. You have not for- gotten Madame's New Year's party.

## No, I haven't. I suppose all the waxworks are coming?
I don't know, sir. Madame made the arrangements.

## How is she?
She is upstairs.

## What's the matter, Max?
I just found out why all those tele- phone calls. It is not Miss Desmond they want. It is the car they want to rent.

## What is it, Max? Want to wash the car, or are you doing a little spying in your off hours?
You must be very careful as you cross the patio. Madame may be watching.

## How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?
I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night...

## You made her a star?
And she's turned you into a servant.

## Joseph C. Gillis?
That's right.

## What car?
Relax, fans. The car isn't here.

## Is that So?
I lent it to a friend of mine. He took it up to Palm Springs.

## So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?
More or less. Only for the end I've got a gimmick that's real good.

## Got a title?
Bases Loaded. There's a 4O-page outline.

## No, that was me. I said, Who wants to see a Civil War picture?
Well, seems like Zanuck's got himself a baseball picture.

## Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton. Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
Frankly, no.

## So you need three hundred dollars? Of course, I could give you three hundred dollars. Only I'm not going to.
Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?

## No?
Gillis, get this through your head. I'm not just your agent. It's not the ten per cent. I'm your friend.

## How's that about your being my friend?
Forget Romanoff's. It's the car I'm talking about. If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off.

## CAPTAIN You do not deny having killed this man, Miss Desmond?
HOMICIDE Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.

## HOMICIDE Was theft involved? Did you catch him trying to steal something, or find he had stolen something?
CAPTAIN Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.

## Who?
Paramount studios.

## Cameras? ...What is it, Max?
The cameras have arrived, Madame.

## What is the scene? Where am I?
This is the staircase of the palace.

## But where?
I've discovered a new way into the Phantom Zone.

## But what will happen?
I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall.

## What is it?
The Coffer of Shadow. Look at it.

## What does it mean?
The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .

## Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a baseball game?
Softball.

## But which one?
Sorry, mistress.

## Is he your entertainment for tonight?
He will be. In about five minutes.

## I came as quickly as I could. What is the danger?
It's what we were warned about.

## A Storm Dragon?
No, a super girl.

## Why did she have to show up now?
Eliminate her.

## Am I? Still?
Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can withstand its power.

## Home?
No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.

## Is it her that's bothering you--or your gardener?
Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.

## She didn't take it from you, did she?
I don't want much, Selena. I have simple tastes.

## What do you want?
Western Europe.

## Is this Nigel's doing?
It's a warning, that's for sure.

## What's happening?
I'm taking you to the hospital.

## When can I see, you again ?
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.

## You love me?
We have to have a long talk about all this.

## Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
They don't care, they're tearing it down for a shopping centre.

## Like it?
Yes. It reminds me of home.

## Where Superman's from? Krypton?
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.

## Why not ?
We're from different worlds.

## You don't like me? You hate me?
Of Course I don't hate you. I don't hate anyone.

## What do you feel about me?
There's one sure way to find out how you feel.

## What's that?
Let me kiss you.

## You're not afraid are you?
Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.

## Is this how?
Terrific.

## What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?
I don't love you any more.

## Just like that?
Like turning off a light.

## But why?
Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.

## Hello. Are you still mad at me?
I'm not mad at you.

## And now?
And now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike...

## You think so?
I don't see why not.

## But what if---it wasn't real?
Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever.

## Are you asking me for a \"date\"?
Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.

## Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
She'll forget about us eventually.

## That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo City! That's what I came, to find! Where does she live?
In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.

## What?
Just one kiss. For old times' sake.

## And you can see how you feel about me, right?
Turn it against her.

## Hmmm?
Remember me? We were in a disaster together.

## Finished your estimate?
Well, there's several ways to go .

## What is it?
A passionfruit smoothee.

## Why should I believe you?
It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl.

## Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl?
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.

## They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?
Yeah.

## You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?
Well...I guess I can't.

## Why the empty cage?
That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd hate to lose you, Ethan.

## Why George, are you proposing?
Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...

## Hey, where you going?
I've got things to do.

## What about my proposal?
Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch.

## I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But I don't know what it is.
Do you have any theories about last night?

## Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?
Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to meet you, Jimmy.

## Can I give you a lift?
Oh, no thanks.

## Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.

## Did anybody notice you?
I can't help it if men notice me.

## You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
You bet your ass.

## Why didn't you tell me?
You're supposed to guess.

## What's a tree?
It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.

## Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?
Yes, I know the equations---I just can't see it in my head.

## Can you create life?
I'm sorry... I didn't know.

## No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?
There isn't any.

## This is all your clothes?
I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since...

## Since what? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
I'd rather not talk about it.

## You're not...an orphan are you?
My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.

## How'd you do that?
Must've been a defective puck.

## But what for?
She just hates anybody who isn't afraid of her.

## You sure?
Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away...

## Why is he acting so strangely?
I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.

## Don't you believe in knocking?
Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot.

## What can I do for you?
I'm Linda Lee.

## No plans for the weekend, Linda?
No, MR. Danvers.

## Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?
I'd love to.

## What? Me?
Sure. Mate in five moves.

## Cigarette?
Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head.

## ...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me like that?
I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a good tannisroot ointment. Every night.

## Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.

## Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much. It is beginning to rule your heart.

## Who are you ?
I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.

## For what?
Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.

## What's it like?
It's the most beautiful place in the universe.

## Where is inner space?
It's everywhere. But water is always the door.

## This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
I was on Earth...

## Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
Yes. I went there to find the lost Power Source...

## Others?
Criminals.

## Are you happy, Zaltar?
What kind of a question is that? Of course, I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.

## You look at them? How?
The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere.. If you have the right tools.

## Of course, my dear. What can I do?
Help me to get back to Earth. Where my friends are. They need me.

## Why?
Then teach me how.

## Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.

## Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?
Please. I have to get back to Earth. My friends are in trouble. And unless I bring back the Power Source, Argo City will die.

## You're going to take me back?
Buddy, are we in trouble.

## What are you talkin' about?
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.

## Mr. Roebush?
Brad.

## Brad?
I seem to be.

## You always did. Can I give you a hand with that?
You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman -- ...uh, chairperson...

## And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated. Isn't that terrible?
It sure is.

## You...um...you never got married?
Oh...I came close once.

## You thought that?
I thought \"Clark Kent has a really nice voice.\" You didn't even know I was there.

## Me?
I'm talking about salt. Oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. That's what picnics are for.

## Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --
Call me.

## Uh-huh.
Can I help?

## Well, aren't you excited?
Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day.

## Do you really know Superman?
We get together sometimes.

## Mr. Kent, could I ask you something?
Sure.

## Actually, that's why I stopped by. He's realy sorry, he wanted to make it, but then he...ran into a problem.
Could you get me Superman's autograph?

## So, Mr. White? Can I go ahead and make my travel arrangements?
Exactly what I was about to ask about me.

## It's practically an American ritual, Mr. White! Isn't that so, Jimmy?
I wouldn't know Mr. Kent. Most of the people I went to high school with are still in high school.

## Name?
Gus Gorman.

## Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman?
Yeah.

## A television set?
Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.

## You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
Thirty-six weeks of chronic unemployment, thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes of hard-working citizens. Do you know what you are?

## What about this week's check?
Sonofagun! Look at this here!

## What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach? Everybody loses them fractions?
They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.

## Who gets it, the company?
No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.

## So where is all them half-centses?
They're just ... floating around out there. The computer knows where.

## How many sugars?
One. And a half.

## Quittin' time, Gus. Comin'?
Uh ... no, man. I got some work to finish up here.

## Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
Yeah. A raise . .

## Say what?
The boss wants to see you.

## Say who?
Mr. Gorman, just answer me one question...

## Say, fella, I understand. I can -- what do the kids say these days -- \"dig where you're comin' from.\" You want to be rich, right?
Uh...

## Yeah? What do you do with 'em?
Or socks.

## Cause I know about getting' them half-centses?
I don't think you understand.

## Man, what is this?
Columbia.

## Wipe 'em out?
Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down to the last bean.

## How do you do that?
Like everything else in the 20th century, Gus. You push buttons.

## What?
Hey, boss.

## They ain't got captains?
Yes, but they don't really need them. it's just a throw- back to some sentimental sea- faring baloney.

## Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
You catch on fast, old buddy. Tell him about the pumps. I know how you love the part about the pumps.

## I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
Lookit, you're getting' what you want all the time. it ain't right that I don't get somethin'! I never get somethin'!

## Is this blackmail?
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.

## Is this whitemail?
Fair's fair.

## What do you want?
A waste-basket? GUS Those are plans. Blueprints.

## For what?
A computer.

## You designed it?
I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.

## What will it do?
Everything.

## What will it get me?
Anything.

## Yeah? How's it look?
Yeah, sure. Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...

## You want to mess with Superman?
Don't make me talk, please. I got enough problems just hangin' on.

## I ain't about to argue with you. What's gonna happen to them three? Ross the boss and those ladies?
That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore.

## We gonna crash?
I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.

## We back in Metropolis?
Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...

## What she call you?
You will command the tankers to sail toward a 50-mile area in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.

## And do what?
I know, by computers.

## Who is she?
Her name's Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's Girl Friday.

## Who's the other woman?
That's his sister. Vera Webster.

## Why do I have to do this?
It was hot!

## What terrific story?
Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.

## I'm in no rush. So what do you have in mind?
Lots of things...

## Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
Never. I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.

## No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
It isn't much, really, you see, there's this little boat. Well, not so little, really. And it's not going where it's supposed to go and...

## Diet soda?
Energy! And when they say \"Energy\" what do they mean? Nuclear? too dangerous. Solar? Too underdeveloped.

## So I understand from the graffiti I've seen.
How would you know?

## And he use to be such a sweetie pie! What's wrong with him the last two weeks?
I can't see anything.

## Where do you usually find a light switch?
Come on, will you? We've got to get ready before he gets here.

## Gus?
Superman. The boy you left behind.

## How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
By hand. Like the pioneers did.

## Couldn't we just get a computer to do this?
Mr. White, you be in this shot, handing them their plane tickets.

## Why do I have to do this?
It's modern. It's up-to-date. It's state-of-the art. People, I am in love with this machine. Go ahead, Mr. White.

## Where's the handle?
There is no handle! You just push a button.

## Missing?
Embezzled, Mr. Webster. Stolen from the firm.

## Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you know my Staff Dietician?
Hello.

## Well, chum? What now? Kiss the 85 thou goodbye? Pay some thief's salary while he thinks up new ways to shake the money tree?
He's bound to slip up sooner or later.

## That's what I want to know! By whom? Whom?
Somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the Aerospace Center and reach Vulcan.

## Where did it come from?
The planet Superman came from. Krypton.

## That's it! The last tanker! They're all mine now! All...
So?

## Not quite. What is that in the lower right hand corner?
Come on, let's give it a dry run.

## Yeah. I'll check.
Who needs Gus?

## Anybody been hurt?
So far the hostages are unharmed.

## Hostages?
Tourists, about twenty of 'em.

## Are you okay?
She'll be fine.

## When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
Uh...

## I don't?
Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.

## Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you. Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism?
Actually, yes.

## Be my guest.
Lois, why don't you at least get one of those automatic ones?

## Really?
Of course, that's what friends are for.

## In July?
Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents.

## No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?
Frankly, once you've seen Superman in action, Niagara Falls tends to leave you cold.

## I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.

## Whoever, I Look, maybe you ought to take a walk and clear your head. I'II meet you back at the motel.
Superman? Oh, was he here?

## Because of what I'm betting. My life.
Who ?

## Well, not in your mind, but maybe ...deep in your heart ...
What?

## I'm in love with you. How do you feel?
We'd better talk.

## \"What's happening.\" Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so ... where do you want to ... talk?
I guess it would be all right if - Lois, now that you know me, I think you ought to know it all.

## Do you ... ah ... want to step outside?
Blood ... my ... blood ...

## Sleep well?
Never closed my eyes.

## Take it easy. Take a deep breath.
What else could I do?

## I'm fine... ... What was I talking about? Before?
... Superman?... . .

## Everything on it?
Everything on it.

## Get your head out of the clouds, Kent. Where you been the last twelve hours?
Uh...home...

## What?
Gee. But --

## What else is ballast for?
How would you like to take a little vacation? I mean you've earned it, you know? You deserve it.

## Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
Is this a philosophy seminar? No. This is getaway.

## Why didn't you go before we left?
It's beautiful.

## Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton.
Selfish! But they get a chance at happiness. Can't I have that chance?

## And she -- the one you have chosen -- she feels as much for you?
Yes.

## No possibility for parole?
The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.

## Where?
North.

## That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean -- what's it for?
We have all of this without you. You cannot bargain with what you don't have.

## The son of Jor-El on this Planet?
Oh my Fullness, as I explained to you before, I am about the best there is. Second best there is.

## What do you want?
Australia.

## Why do you say this to me when you know I will kill you for it?
Kill me? Lex Luthor? Extinguish the greatest criminal flame of our age? Eradicate the only man on earth ...

## What more?
Cuba.

## It will. Starting with your own.
Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?

## Who is this imbecile? Where is he?
I wish I knew. -- Oh, God.

## Who is this ... Superman?
In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.

## There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
Um... .we have made this guarantee.

## Yes, but will you honor it?
We have not the choice to refuse, have we, if we believe it is a real hydrogen bomb that they have.

## What shall we do now?
Stay. I will come to you.

## Yes?
He... cares. He actually cares about these ... ...these People. These earth People .

## General --- ?
We must combine our strength.

## Did you really believe we would give up our advantage?
\"Super-sucker . \" For once, Lex Luthor was right.

## What about here?
Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.

## Shouldn't you pay the cabbie?
Oh ... Right... I'll be back in a flash.

## Like me?
You'll find a good man Lacy. You deserve one.

## No Paris?
I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.

## You always overreact, Clark. How terrible can it be?
Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois.

## Politely?
... Please leave your message at the beep.

## Clark, it's Lois. This is the fourth message. I've left... Where are you ?
It's just a bad flu, really. How did you know ...

## And what do we get out of it?
If my plan works, gentlemen, I'll just take a tiny commission ... something ...appropriate... a number with a lot of zeros after it.

## Impossible? Why?
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.

## But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away? What good was my letter?
Well, I don't understand.

## Would you mind waiting for me in the visitor's gallery?
N-no...I mean...you bet.

## Your grandfather had one iron rule that's stood me well. Never fraternize with the help. Keep too your own station. Am I clear?
Darling, it's good riddance. Let her go. And while you're at it, fire that Clark Kent. He hasn't been here in days. He hasn't even called.

## Yes, darling?
Stuff it.

## Is he for real?
One hundred percent. And I like him that way.

## Superman gets mail here?
I think there's an angle.

## An angle?
Daddy loves to whip up campaigns! People eat it up. We'll make this kid a celebrity. The whole world will be waiting for Superman's answer.

## Who?
Clark. He's late again. I can't figure him out.

## What's he going to say?
Something ... wonderful.

## What's that?
Our other dinner guest.

## Where's Clark?
He was getting on ... and then this man with luggage and ... oh, it's a long story.

## A toupee that flies?
... I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.

## Get the box, nephew.
But why the hair?

## Hey, Uncle Lex, how's the Nuclear Guy goin' to find his way here?
Oh Leonard ... When I sent the remains of my last experiment ...

## The one Superman wrecked up?
Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.

## What?
Boy, are you gonna get it.

## Ready, Uncle Lex?
If you need us we'll, be five hundred feet underground waiting for the Nuclear winter to turn to nuclear spring.

## What I need this for?
For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on.

## What? A genius? ... an inspiration?
You are ... nothing. I am father now.

## I am an experiment? I am freako?
I made you, and I can destroy you.

## It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
Why? Because I want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block.

## Still having delusions, Lex Luthor?
I'll deal with you later.

## But ... but isn't the world about to be osterized?
No ... it's the way it always is ... on the brink ... with good fighting evil.

## Ahhhh, my favorite part of the day. Who else could have thought of this aquarium?
Nobody else.

## That the planet blew up on May 23, 1937. That the rocket ship with the revolting little freak in it took three years to reach Earth. Ergo?
Not you. You. Tell me again.

## A hot story, huh?
It was hot, yes.

## Lois isn't here?
She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess.

## What's she doing in California?
It's for that piece she's doing on women and competition. She's off to the Women's Western Golf Classic.

## Clark...Son...that...thing you did with the Sheriff today... those...stunts...you don't do those things at school, do you?
No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.

## Hey, you're getting a better class of people in your office these days, Boss.
Do you know where you're headed?

## Your bookie?
No.

## Are there any more at home like you?
Not really, no.

## Well, how are you enjoying your first day on the job?
I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.

## See? Didn't I tell you this was a tough town?
You described the exact contents of my purse.

## Oh, not really. I guess I'll just watch a little TV and -- -- unless...would you be interested in dinner?
Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.

## Don't you ever give up?
No. I'm just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don't mind my saying so.

## Can I take you to the airport?
Not unless you can fly.

## Come again?
I'm telling you, I was there.

## He grabbed me! He held me! He set me down gently! How could that be done with mirrors?
Look, there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce.

## Jealous? Of what?
Of this...Superman.

## Is that what they're calling him?
They will once I hang it on him in tomorrow's edition.

## You too. I just...I can't get it on for good guys. Y'know?
You! The girl from the volcano! Kryptonite...

## He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.
What are you doing here?

## The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.

## Couldn't we forget the plane? You could lift me in your big strong arms?
Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.

## Me and my real estate? How many other girls, Miss Teschmacher, are lucky enough to have a Park Avenue address like this?
It isn't a Park Avenue address. really.

## This?
Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers? A part of that will always be with me.

## You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?
Even that would be an improvement.

## Again?
He's from another world.

## Tough guy, huh?
I read the article.

## Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
Deductive reasoning, my friends! That's the name of the game. What does it say here?

## I will as soon as I get the sand out of my nose.
I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?

## You're happy, aren't you?
La de da da...

## What do you suggest, my dear?
The least we can do is leave him another door jam.

## Weak sister. I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
You ever try to run in high heels? You probably did.

## Ready?
Ready.

## You?! How about me?
You have two minutes and thirty- two seconds.

## You're not going to hit me?
I knew you'd hit me.

## A night on the town instead of under it?
Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.

## What are you going to do to him?
Nothing, nothing. I just want to invite him to tea.

## What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
He always shows up when somebody's in danger.

## Danger? Somebody? Lex -- where are you going?
Lex is going bye-bye.

## Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?
If you persist, you leave us no choice.

## Will you abide by the Council's opinion?
Neither my wife nor I will attempt to leave Krypton.

## an Ode to Spring. are there one or two \"T's\" in bloodletting?
It's because I'm an intrepid girl reporter, Jimmy. Besides, the chief of detectives has the hots for me.

## Don't just stand there gapin' Jonathan. Can't you see he's cold?
Well - gotta change that tire if were gonna get home.

## Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize, I know.
I was thinkin' what to call him. I was thinkin' I had an uncle who was a fine man, you recall him? The Church Sexton

## If one of you can get that -- I mean, I want the real Superman. Who is he? Where's he from? What's his favorite ball team? What's up?
He is. Usually.

## Not a chance. It's too nice a night.
Easy now, miss, I've got you?

## Superman?
Right on the first guess.

## Wha'...what are you doing here?
I came to talk to you.

## Well...flashlight?
I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me.

## Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?
Not exactly. He's kind of a rewrite man. Actually, he's a bit dull, if you know what I mean.

## Oh. Well, where do we start?
Ask, You're the girl reporter.

## You think they're strange?
I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.

## How old are you?
Thirty-five.

## How much do you weigh?
195 pounds.

## Can you really see through anything?
Uh-huh.

## Is it true you're impervious to pain?
Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone.

## Do bullets really bounce off you?
Only when somebody shoots them at me.

## What color underwear am I wearing?
Pink.

## Can you actually fly faster than the speed of sound?
Sure.

## Do you like pink?
Very much.

## Where do you hail from?
I...uh...

## Now then, Otis. Did you get what I asked for?
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.

## I...uh...check.
Otis, were you up to your old tricks?

## And now he lies to me. He has been stealing ladies' purses again. Haven't you? Haven't you, you miserable petty crook?
I guess I...uh...regressed.

## Is that real enough for you?
It is for me.

## On radio waves?
And garbage doors.

## I'm just fine, Ally. What about you?
I'm fine. Still working with my father.

## And what does he do again?
He used to work with you. Until you found out he was having an affair with your wife.

## How is Mrs. Stephens?
We're...not together.

## I'd heard that. But she's well?
Yes...fine.

## And Zoe? How's Zoe?
I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay.

## Are you still in touch?
Not really. The last time I saw her was at that clinic. That was a long time ago.

## Which clinic?
Other clinics? Oh sure. Clinics, half-way houses, treatment centers, detox units...

## Then...when did she get better?
She didn't.

## What...does it turn to?
It turns to steaming piss.

## What happened?
Nothing. We made it to the hospital. I didn't have to go as far as I was prepared to. But I was prepared to go all the way.

## Case?
I know Risa and Wendell Walker. They wouldn't hire a goddamned lawyer. And the Ottos wouldn't deal

## Why are you telling me this?
I'm telling you this because... we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel.

## Why are you telling me this?
I'm telling you this because we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel...

## Was it good?
I'll be back around nine.

## Are you sure?
Yeah.

## Why?
I don't know.

## What do you mean 'outgrown it'?
I'm not sure.

## How is Nicole? Is she around?
She's resting. In her room.

## So what brings you out tonight?
I don't see how that concerns you, Billy.

## How?
Well, it being so depressing and all. But it's reality. You can't just turn this off because you happen to think it's a bad idea.

## Why not?
Because it's what we have to do.

## Have you been waiting long?
A while.

## Does this mean I can't take a shower?
No. It should be dry by now.

## What time's he coming home?
When the game's over, I guess.

## What are you thinking?
Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus. He won't want to go. He never does. He'll cry and want to hold on to me.

## You believe that?
I have to.

## Why?
Because I have to.

## Is it true that you gave Nicole one of Lydia's dresses? That she was wearing it when the bus crashed?
Yes.

## Why did you do that, Billy?
Dolores. No one calls me 'Mrs. Driscoll'.

## Yes. What do you mean by 'hippies'?
I mean, the way they look. Their hair and clothing...

## Do they have any reputation for drugs?
And they loved Bear.

## For rabbits?
Billy loved to see his kids in the bus. They always sat in the back, so they could wave to each other. It comforted him.

## From what?
Did he have any particular problems that you knew of? Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...

## You talked about it?
No. I saw it on his face.

## And what's that?
With our hands.

## What do you mean?
You mentioned that he had a learning disability.

## Did they give him special care?
I have a question for you, Mr. Stephens.

## What's that, Dolores?
That would complicate things.

## Because I'd be to blame, right?
Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour. Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.

## He knows that? Billy?
Yes. He does.

## You've talked to Billy?
I did.

## You heard what Abbott said?
Yes.

## Anything you didn't understand?
There might have been a word or two that slipped by. Maybe you could clarify it for me, just to be absolutely sure.

## That's what he said, is it?
Yes. Abbot understands these things.

## Why would he be frightened?
I don't know. But it was weird in terms of what happened next. Sean was still watching his mother.

## What do you think?
Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.

## You want a cup of tea or something?
A cup of tea would be nice. Would it be alright if I sit down for a few minutes, Mrs. Otto? I want to talk to you.

## How long has Dolores been driving that bus, Mr. Otto? How many times has she steered clear of danger? What went wrong that morning?
I didn't ask if you wanted milk.

## What happened to summer?
Summer's over. It's fall.

## And winter?
Well, winter's far behind us now.

## So do you like your new room?
It's interesting.

## Is this mine?
Yes. It's a present.

## From you?
No. From Mr. Stephens. That was him on the phone just now. He was calling to see how you were.

## That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us.
Who's Mr. Stephens?

## Did he say what about?
No.

## Was he drinking? Could you tell?
Jenny, it's time for you to go to bed.

## Is he coming over now? Right away?
That's what he said.

## What's a ditty again?
It's like a song.

## Nicole?
Yes.

## Don't you usually like to sit at the back? To wave at your Dad?
I want to sit beside you tomorrow.

## What, Mason?
That's right.

## The people in the town?
Yes.

## So he was mean?
No. Not mean. Just...very angry.

## Should I keep reading?
Okay.

## That you didn't die? Like the other children?
Yes. Like Bear and the Ansel twins and Sean and...

## What do you want me to do for you, Mr. Stephens?
I won't lie.

## So you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this. It's not going to be easy, Nicole. Do you understand that?
It was snowing.

## There was nothing reckless in Mrs. Driscoll's behavior?
I object to that form of question. Note that.

## And what was the weather like at this time?
I have no questions.

## Will you be spending more than a night?
Hard to say. I might have...some business here.

## What about Doreen?
She...she was a friend of mine.

## That's the local bar?
...coming home drunk and I guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that...and...

## What do you mean?
People who will help our cause.

## Indian?
Yes.

## What do they do?
Crafts.

## Crafts?
Wanda does these photographic things. That's one of her pictures on the wall.

## Have they ever been busted?
No.

## Need a hand?
Sure, it you could find a towel in this bag. I know my wife packed one in there...

## How old is she?
Almost three.

## Is this it?
Perfect.

## Why am I calling you? You're my father. I'm not supposed to call you? What's the matter with wanting to talk to you, Daddy?
Nothing's wrong with trying to talk to me, Zoe.

## So what's the problem?
The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now.

## Yes.
Cause you think I'm stoned, Daddy? 'Cause you think I've got a needle stuck in my arm? Is that what you're thinking, Daddy?

## Why can't you talk to me?
I...I just need to know what state you're in so I know...how to talk to you...how to act...

## Daddy?
Yes.

## Don't you want to hear?
Yes. Give me your news, Zoe.

## Do you know what that means, Daddy? Does it register?
Yes.

## What for?
You can't ask me that! Not anymore! You asked me what I wanted. Not what I wanted it for. I want money.

## I love you, Zoe. I'll be there soon, and I'll take care of you. No matter what happens. I'll take care of you.
Do you have the blood test?

## Some more wine?
I'm afraid this meat is overdone.

## What is it?
Poached salmon.

## Is there shrimp on it?
Yes.

## Who are you?
I'm a lawyer.

## You've been retained?
Yes.

## You think someone else caused the accident?
So you're just the thing we need.

## Isn't that what you want us to believe? That we're completely defenseless? That you know what's best?
Listen to me, Mrs Otto. Listen very carefully. I do know what's best.

## Are you expensive?
No.

## Are you a reporter?
No.

## In what way?
Been drinking since high school. Fucked himself up. Used to be smart enough.

## Any criminal record?
Probably half a dozen traffic convictions. Drunk driving. Lost his licence. That's why he don't work no more.

## How does the family survive?
Don't know. Food banks, welfare, church charity. They scrape by.

## Now on that morning, did there come a time, Nicole, when you left your parents' house?
Yes.

## What time in the morning was this?
About eight-thirty in the morning.

## Was anyone waiting for the bus with you?
No. I was alone. My sister Jenny was sick and stayed home that day.

## Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
Like what? I mean, I don't remember a lot.

## And where did you sit that morning?
My usual place. On the right side. The first seat.

## And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning?
Until the accident? No. Yes, there was.

## Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?
Yes.

## You remember that much?
As I'm talking, I'm remembering more about it.

## You are?
Yes.

## Before the actual accident?
Yes.

## This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking?
Yes, I understand.

## Why were you scared?
Dolores was driving too fast.

## Mrs. Driscoll was driving too fast? What made you think that, Nicole?
The speedometer. And it was downhill there.

## You could see the speedometer?
Yes. I looked. I remember clearly now. It seemed we were going too fast down the hill. I was scared.

## How fast would you say Mrs. Driscoll was going? To the best of your recollection?
Seventy-two miles an hour.

## Seventy-two miles an hour? You're sure of this?
Positive.

## You believe that the bus driven by Mrs. Driscoll was going at seventy- two miles an hour at this time?
I told you I was positive. The speedometer was large and easy to see from where I was.

## You saw the speedometer?
Yes.

## Did you say anything to Mrs. Driscoll?
No.

## Why not?
I was scared. And there wasn't time.

## There wasn't time?
No. Because the bus went off the road. And crashed.

## You remember this?
Yes. I do now. Now that I'm telling it.

## What do you remember about the accident?
That was great.

## Really?
You're going to blow everyone away.

## You mean it?
Of course.

## What's so funny?
Just the way Dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals. It's like the biggest thing in her life.

## What took so long?
Nothing.

## What's that?
Mrs. Ansel's clothing.

## Does it fit?
They say I'm lucky because I can't remember the accident.

## Pretty slick, eh?
Very slick.

## Do you like the colour?
It's okay.

## You and Mom have a lawyer?
Well, yes. He's your lawyer too.

## My lawyer? Why do I need a lawyer?
But you didn't lose me.

## What are you up to, Nicole?
Nothing.

## Are you sleeping?
No.

## Well, okay. I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning. That's okay with you?
Great.

## What's going to happen to Dolores?
I don't know.

## Will the police do anything to her?
It's too late for that. She can't drive the bus anymore. The school board saw to that right off.

## Is \"he\" inside?
But of course...

## Alone or surrounded?
A Senator, an Agent and Something - With - Long - Red - Hair.

## Just hopping tonight. Leo Bartha been in?
You don't like it, do you. I think she will accept, but I'm not sure. She may be too dependent on her brother.

## See my mother?
I only had a few hours.

## You told him that?
Not in those exact words - you know what a temper he's got.

## When do these hot-headed boys of yours go on the road?
Coupla weeks. For eight weeks.

## That's a nice tour. All booked? When was Susie around here last?
Four five nights ago. That's how I know the romance is off. Also Steve's in a very bad mood.

## How is dear old J.J. by the way?
I see you're full of human feelings...

## I'll by that, son. Now, you owe ME a favor. Be good to my kid sister...
Right!

## Take it easy, Susie. He wouldn't be much of a man if he didn't understand my concern. Would you, son?
No, I wouldn't...

## Is it news to you?
Frankly, son, you lost me on that last hill. Just give us the punch line...

## Susie, as always, is free to say anything she thinks. Go on, dear, say exactly what's on your mind, dear.
Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?

## Susie, you're very much in my thoughts today.
Those \"dears\" sound like daggers. May I suggest that you stop DARING her to speak?

## Why?
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...

## Why are you trembling, dear...?
History repeats itself. Everything that happened to Alan Leslie...began with a smear like this...

## Then whose fault was it, J.J.? It was someone's fault, wasn't it?
I said Sidney!...

## I thought we were talking about Sidney?
Let me finish, dear. You had your say, now let me have mine...

## Susie, did you know about this accusation...?
No...

## You in a mood, Susie, to run over to Milgrim's later and buy a few new frocks?
No. I'm going home.

## Why does everything you say sound like a threat?
Hello, Harry.

## Bonna sera, commendatore. Come sta?
I just checked \"downtown\". Quiet everywhere tonight.

## Incidentally, what happened to that doll? - You gave me the item last night. Still alive?
Yeah. At Bellevue. Still hanging on. But they still don't know if she was pushed.

## You just had a good example of it. A press agent eats a columnists dirt and is expected to call it manna.
Can I come in for a minute?

## I like Harry, but I can't deny he sweats a little.
What, some cheap, gruesome gags?

## You told me you'd break up that romance - when?
You want something done, J.J., but I doubt if you yourself know what's involved.

## I don't?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...

## Uh huh.
Are you finished?

## When?
Tonight. Before you go to bed. The cat is in the bag and the bag is in the river.

## You mean they've been fired already, on the basis of this crude smear?
I know Steve. No.

## How?
Get Steve back his job...please...

## He means that much to you...?
Yes. With your \"prestige\" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.

## I got that boy coming over here. What's so funny?
Presumably yours... That's according to St. Dallas.

## What's this boy got that Susie likes?
Integrity - acute, like indigestion.

## What does that mean - integrity?
Full of beans, ain't you? But you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now...

## She knows now.
Are you listening?

## Is that a fact? He's a dilly, ain't he? By the by, what did he have against this boy?
He goes out with girls.

## That's a question I usually like to ask YOU. Your secretary phoned.
Well, I'll be darned. And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?

## What about?
Something about a Frank D'Angelo trying to reach you...

## Could this be that boy?
Dallas? Could be. He doesn't look like a reefer smoker...

## And why should I bribe the woman who holds most of my heart?
No. It's one of J.J.'s occasional beau gestes. Evidently the fellow's funny, so he gave him a plug.

## What's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates?
Let's wait till Christmas - it's more legitimate then.

## Is Frank D'Angelo around?
At the bar - Sidney...

## Don't tell me you started a polka with Leo Bartha?
No. That's what I mean - I'm being fired for what I didn't do.

## And where was his wife?
I don't know - it's a big apartment. But I wasn't interviewed. In fact, I was totally unprepared for what happened.

## Do you think you could do something, Sidney?
That's what I'm thinking, Rita. Maybe...

## Can you be there by two-thirty?
Rita, say hello to Otis Elwell.

## Back?
One of those business meetings, honey - always coming up in the middle of the night.

## Don't you know who that man is?
Yeah. Otis Elwell. The columnist.

## That's the third time he's called today.
What sort of thing?

## He wants me to break a leg?
No, an arm, he said. I told him you were sure the item would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column in tomorrow's...

## But what?
That makes five days in a row that Mr. Hunsecker's cut you out of his column.

## Who else phoned?
The renting agent and the tailor.

## It won't leave much of a balance in the bank... Mr. Robard? Could you locate him?
I wish I could help in some way, Sidney.

## You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world?
Sidney, please, dear, if you feel nervous...

## So what'll you do if I feel nervous? You'll open your meaty, sympathetic arms...?
Sid...you got me so...I don't know what...

## What's the matter?
Nothing...

## Did you send my folks in Philly the check...?
Yes.

## Only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or Hunsecker or both.
Begging your pardon, I haven't been down the bowery in years!

## Did you now? On which bounce?
and I just had to drop by and tell you how great I thought you were.

## Cheers. What time is it, Al?
No, I don't mind. I'm busy too.

## You're touchy, Sidney - don't be so touchy...
And it would cost a pretty penny, huh?

## Feels like a Monday night, don't it...?
We stick in each others craw.

## Yes, but why?
Well, for one thing, he thinks J.J. is some kind of monster.

## Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?
And I'm sorry for you, too, Sidney. You're going down with the ship.

## I'm not a man, Sidney, I'm -
I made you write a beautiful song...

## Why did you call me?
Would you buy me a cup of coffee? In there...

## What chip?
They have it in a vault at Cyberdyne... It's gotta be from the other one like you.

## In the bathroom. Danny, can you get them for us?
My God.

## Look, whatever you want me to do, I'll do. I just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?
No one must follow your work.

## Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?
I'm a cybernetic organism. Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.

## This in intense. Get a grip, John. Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself. So what's the deal?
My mission is to protect you.

## Yeah? Who sent you?
You did. Thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time.

## So this other guy? He's a terminator too, right, like you?
Not like me. A T-1000. Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.

## What does that mean?
Liquid metal.

## Where we going?
We have to leave the city, immediately. And avoid the authorities.

## Can I stop by my house?
Negative. The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.

## You sure?
I would.

## I'm right here. I'm fine. What's the dog's name?
Max.

## I need a minute here, okay? You're telling me it can imitate anything it touches?
Anything it samples by physical contact.

## Like it could disguise itself as anything... a pack of cigarettes?
No. Only an object of equal size.

## Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me?
Negative. The T-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.

## Oh, great. And what happens to her?
You just can't, okay? Trust me on this.

## Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right?
Right.

## Cool.
What?

## Does it hurt?
I sense injuries. The data could be called pain.

## How long do you live? I mean, last?
A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.

## \"Hasta la vista, baby\"?
Yeah, or \"later, dickwad.\" Or if someone gets upset you say \"chill out.\" Like that. Or you can do combinations.

## Smile?
Yeah. Smile. You know. People smile, right? Watch.

## Not even of dying?
No.

## You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
No. I have to stay functional until my mission is complete. Then it doesn't matter.

## Why do you cry?
You mean people? I don't know. We just cry. You know. When it hurts.

## Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway. You get it?
No.

## I don't care!! There's gotta be another way. Haven't you learned anything?! Haven't you figured out why you can't kill people?
I'll deal with the police.

## Is it dead?
Terminated.

## I don't trust it! These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know. We may never have this opportunity again.
No shit?

## I couldn't... oh, God. You... came here... to stop me?
Uh huh.

## Ready to rock?
Ready.

## I see. Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines. Now you think they don't exist?
But you've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press.

## So what do you think, Doctor? I've shown a lot of improvement, haven't I?
Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds.

## Can it be destroyed?
Unknown.

## I'll bet. Makes you a more efficient killer, right?
Correct.

## Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
No.

## Why him?
In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.

## Uh huh, great. Then those fat fucks in Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show, right?
And Skynet fights back.

## Why attack Russia?
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.

## Jesus. How much do you know about Dyson?
I have detailed files.

## Is it safe for them here?
Take your kids. Go to a hotel. Right now. Don't pack. Let's go.

## Are you afraid?
On Furtwngler.

## What does he mean, too correct?
I don't know.

## When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?
I don't know. But you and I already know that he has saved lives.

## I'm Steve. What's your name?
David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.

## Sounds a lot of run. So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?
I guess so, sir.

## Where you from, David?
I guess you admire musicians.

## You think a whole orchestra, what, a hundred and forty or so guys, could be orchestrated?
I guess it's possible.

## So, what does the Russki want?
Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.

## David, need to ask you something. You heard this rumour the British found something called the Hinkel Archive?
Yes.

## Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.

## Why not show Dr. Furtwngler the evidence. It may refresh his memory?
Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...

## and totally irrelevant.
David, what are you Counsel for the Defence now? Did you hear the question?

## What?
Your manner.

## Can I ask you a favour, Major?
Yeah.

## With more what? More what?
Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.

## David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.

## What is it with you, David? Where are your feelings? Where's your hatred, your disgust? Where's your fucking outrage, David?
Hello, Major, my name is Dymshitz. I'm glad to see you.

## So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtwngler?
Not yet.

## There are good Party members who help, and there are dirty non-Party members who inform on you. Of course, they gave him privileges.
But what... before that turns rotten... What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel?

## What museum?
No can do.

## You live here, in Berlin?
Yes.

## You do shorthand and typing?
Yes.

## Okay, let's see. How long were you in the camp for?
Three months.

## Says here because of your father. What's that mean?
My father was one of the officers in the plot against Hitler. They arrested the plotters and their families.

## Think you can get me any of that?
Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.

## I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?
No. Ours was damaged.

## What's in those files?
I'm sorry.

## Do you know where the Adagio begins?
Of course.

## What is this, Emmi?
I can't do this. It's not right.

## What's not right?
I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him.

## Could you tell us about being made a Prussian Privy Councillor. How did that happen to a non-Party member?
I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.

## Then why did you conduct at one of their Nuremberg rallies?
I did not conduct at at the rally, I conducted on the evening before the rally.

## It's the truth.
How come?

## I keep hearing you helped a lot of Jews to escape. How did you do that?
I don't remember in detail, there were so many.

## Did you call someone you knew?
I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.

## May I ask a question?
Sure.

## When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?
It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.

## Why were they going to arrest you?
I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.

## So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you?
You sure knew a lot of people in high places.

## I've had enough of this, I'm leaving.
See, David? He can't answer the question. I'll ask it again, Wilhelm, and don't give me any more airy-fairy, intellectual bullshit!

## I've got to hand it to the British, David. You know what those guys are? Decent. Tell me, Herr Dr. Furtwngler, do you know Hans Hinkel?
Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts.

## Who?
I wasn't told. I just knew it.

## How?
I was warned.

## Who warned you?
Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels.

## What did Goering say?
He told me to be careful as one of Goebbels' men was watching me. He read a report on me - everything I said was quoted word by word.

## And what was that?
Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.

## Then you are wrong.
And when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram? Was that the surrender signal, the waving of the white flag?

## Von der Null?
Yes, von der Null.

## Von der Null?
Yes, I know who he is.

## That's an outrageous lie!
Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.

## And what happened to Von der Nul?
I have no idea.

## What?
I said I have illegitimate children. I don't know how many.

## No, that's your problem, Wilhelm. You understand nothing. We'll call you. Go!
Those attitudes do not exist in me.

## Do you know what that is?
Of course I know what that is.

## Okay, so what is it?
Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.

## Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist?
It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.

## Is it true you're going to interview Dr. Furtwngler today?
I'll ask the questions, Helmuth.

## Excuse me. Did you know that he refused to give the Nazi salute when Hitler was present in the audience?
Oh, we didn't play for his birthday, we played the evening before - it was the 19th of April not the 20th.

## Do I know Hans Hinkel?
That's what I asked.

## I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records.
Do I know Hans Hinkel?

## How could I know what's in the archive?
Major.

## Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What are you holding in your hand?
It's Dr. Furtwngler's baton, which I stole.

## How could I forget?
Show me.

## Show you?
Not here, Major, there are people, if anybody should see... please, please, Major...

## I've remembered something else...
Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?

## Yeah?
Furtwngler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday.

## He did?
One of your people told me.

## One of my people?
Yes. A corporal. US Army. A Jew. He said he'd seen the telegram in the Chancellery.

## But I need documentary proof. You know of anything like that?
There's a rumour... I don't know if it's true or not... but ask him about von der Null.

## Never heard of him, who is he?
Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtwngler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan.

## Who's he?
The Miracle Kid.

## His private life?
But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday.

## Was looking at Furtwngler like that?
I don't know what you mean, Major.

## Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?
Sure.

## They said I was dogged?
Like this bandleader.

## Rudolf Otto Werner. Wind section since 1936. What instrument did you play?
First oboe.

## He also conducted for Hitler, didn't he?
Brave? To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.

## Yes, Chuck?
Come to the office, please.

## Not really. Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
I don't know. I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.

## Thanks, Chuck. I need the money. Can I still work the hours around my classes?
It's not brain surgery, Chuck.

## Anything else?
A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...

## Any one of them's ideal for home defense. Which'll it be?
All.

## What do you think?
Great.

## Not lately. Did you check messages?
I'm going to a movie, kiddo. See ya'. You and Matt have a good time.

## What's it to ya?
You must have a girlfriend.

## Do you understand?
Yes. Don't hurt me.

## So, it's from the future, is that right?
One possible future. Four your point of view. I don't know the tech stuff.

## And you're from the future too?
Right.

## The what?
Hunter Killers. Patrol machines. Build in automated factories. Most of us were rounded up, put in camps...for orderly disposal.

## You cold?
Freezing.

## Reese...you got a first name?
Kyle.

## Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
White light. Pain. Like being ripped inside out... slowly. Like being born, maybe.

## Caught one? You mean you got shot?
We gotta get you to a doctor.

## What's he like?
You trust him. He's got that strength. You'd die in a second for John.

## Stop! I don't want to know. Hold still. So...it was John that ordered you here?
I volunteered.

## You volunteered?
I'm sure.

## And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare?
You'll learn.

## About what?
About where you're from.

## Bag some Z's?
Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.

## What's that?
That's where we're going.

## What about it?
Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...

## Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government. Right?
I'm wrong here. I wasn't meant to see this...

## Is this enough?
Yes. And I don't want to know where you got it.

## What's that?
Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable. I learned howto make it when I was a kid.

## Hot dogs?
My whole life has been combat.

## He'll find us, won't he?
Probably. Sarah, if I get zeroed...

## Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?
Good fighters.

## Someone?
A girl. You know.

## What are you doing?
You'll beg for mercy in a second.

## What are you doing?
Cover...our footsteps...

## And who was the enemy?
SKYNET. A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics. A modified Series 4800.

## Then how are you supposed to get back?
Can't. Nobody goes home. Nobody else comes through. It's just him and me.

## Why?
I didn't build the fucking thing.

## You've heard enough. Decide. Are you going to release me?
I'm afraid that's not up to me.

## Who is in authority here?
...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...

## I won't. Now just relax. Where are you? Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
Yes, but I don't want to leave. I think this guy's following me.

## I guess so. You're a doctor?
Why don't you just stretch out here and get some sleep. It'll take your mom a good hour to get here from Redlands.

## Did you reach the next girl yet?
No. Keep getting an answer- ing machine.

## I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases. Where you going?
To make a statement. I'm gonna give them the name. Maybe the jackals can help us out for once.

## If they can get this on the tube by eleven, she may just call us. How do I look?
Like shit, boss.

## Will you really hold me to it over pennies?
My stock's falling. Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions.

## It probably will. In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time. Why should I settle for that?
Because it's fair. Give me next quarter. If you still feel this way, vote your shares...

## Your father was a friend. Goddamn it... I watched you grow up. How do you end up treating me like this?
Now, look...

## Are you finished?
No. This is my lawyer, Samuel Sutherland. I thought you two should meet.

## Did you play recently?
Hm? No, about a year ago. I was working out of Los Angeles.

## Pardon me... Miss... ?
Oh, no... you.

## I want to know what's going on. Are you part of this?
What's going on? I'm going on my second job this month, and now I'm going on unemployment.

## What's with him?
I don't know... he fell.

## Do you know what to do?
I don't think he's breathing.

## What is your problem?
Ten minutes ago, I'm looking forward to a quiet dinner. I get a note...

## What... is... happening... ?
I was trying to tell you... it's a game.

## A game?
It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks. Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself.

## What are you talking about?
The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...

## You mean, the guy who turned blue and wet himself... ?
I'm sorry, about this...

## Where are you going?
Home.

## Where'd you all go? Motherfucking frat boys. You better hide. Is your life so pathetic that this is something you're willing to pay for?
It was a gift... from my brother.

## \"... wait for help.\" Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
Why not?

## Are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us?
I'll give you a boost.

## This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there?
You pull me up.

## What's C.R.S.?
Consumer Recreation Services. It's their building. They...

## Your shoes cost a thousand dollars?
That one did.

## Nicholas Van Orton? What are you, a czar?
That's classic.

## Why... ?
We hang down here and drop. The garbage'll break our fall.

## Where are we going?
That tall, bright building. Near there.

## What exactly do you do?
Investment banking. Moving money from place to place.

## Can we talk?
It's okay, dad.

## I think I would remember. What makes you think it's me?
Well... the red bra.

## Do you mind if I sit?
Sure. You alright? Is this still that contest you're in...

## Yeah. First Communion. Aren't I a little angel?
Take the picture out.

## What's wrong?
Take the picture out of the frame and show it to me.

## Wha... ?
Not here! They can see.

## What are you doing... ?
Get out.

## Then, what good are you?
I know things... like who you can trust. Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.

## How? How could they have gotten anything?
They did the same to him as they did to you.

## Why else would they be willing to put you under... ?
Overseas operator? Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.

## What did you say?
I didn't say anything.

## Who the fuck cares?
It's just money. You should be glad you're alive.

## Scams, con games. How many?
I don't know. A lot.

## Who is it?
What do you mean? I checked them myself. I made the calls...

## What... what do you mean?
It's out of your hands.

## What are you doing here?
That gun. That... that's not automatic. The guard had an automatic...

## Where'd you get that gun?
It's mine...

## What are you doing?
Nicholas, this is fake. It's all part of the game...

## I have to get to the airport...
No, now wait... think about it. What did you see... ?

## Where are you going in such a hurry?
There's another gig starting in Saudi Arabia. I'm just a walk-on this time though. Bit-part.

## What about dinner sometime, when you get back? Would that be... ?
Is this something you're interested in? I'm not really that person I was.

## Like... where are you from?
Originally, Connecticut.

## Big family... small?
One brother, one sister.

## Studied acting, I assume?
Julliard, yeah.

## Single?
Yes.

## Boyfriend?
No.

## Underwear?
Always.

## That's why it's a classic. Come on, man... how 'bout a hug... ?
They gave me a free jacket at the door.

## Which grad-school?
You look good.

## How long's it been? Since mom died... four years? How are you?
Never better.

## Elizabeth?
Divorced. Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.

## Connie... what brings you here? Is everything alright?
Yeah.

## You need anything?
No.

## Really?
For you.

## \"Consumer Recrreation Services.\" What, do they make golf clubs?
Trust me. Call that number.

## Why?
They make your life fun. Their only guarantee is you will not be bored.

## Fun?
You've heard of it. You've seen other people having it. They're an entertainment service, but more than that.

## This isn't an escort service?
It's a profound life experience.

## Like a stroke?
Call them. Trust me.

## Will you?
I said I would...

## Why would you say that?
I thought you'd like this. Best thing I ever did. If you don't want to do it, DON'T...

## I'll call them, okay?
Shhhhhhh. Wait... wait...

## What are you doing?
They're methodical. They're nothing if they're not that.

## Who?
C.R.S. Who do you think? Jesus H., thank your lucky charms. To think what I almost got you into.

## How do you mean, exactly?
They fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you. And then, just when you think it's done, that's when the real fucking begins.

## What have they been doing to you?
Everything. I'm a goddamn human-pinata...

## Calm down. Why would they keep playing after you paid?
You think I know? I paid them more to make it stop.

## How do you know?
We're going to figure this out. Get a grip on yourself.

## Do you know how to change a tire?
No. Do you? Can't be too hard, can it? I don't think we should be here out in the open like this.

## How did those... ?
Stop this. It's not true...

## You know... how'd you manage the gun? I mean...
I'm sorry, Christ, I'm sorry! How many more times do I have to say I'm sorry before you forgive me... ?

## What?
This... ? Oh, this is just... this is the bill.

## Really?
Yeah.

## Split it?
Oh, God yes please. Thanks, man. I'll take you up on that.

## No money, no identification or passport. You are in a fix. What did happen to you?
Well, where to begin. It's complicated...

## Robbed?
Yes.

## Have you gone to the police?
I don't speak Spanish. All I need is to get back... just enough for that.

## We'll help with the police, if you want to bother. As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion? You say you were mugged?
Yes.

## And, they didn't take that watch?
How much is it? A few thousand, at least. A Rolex like that... lucky for you they missed it.

## Of course you can have it if you need it. Can I get you something to eat?
There's nothing to forgive.

## What is?
No, thank you.

## What's all this for?
We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...

## No, I mean, what is it FOR? What are you selling?
Oh... it's a game.

## A game?
Tailored specifically to each participant. Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.

## What kind of vacation?
It's different every time.

## How long will these take?
An hour for those... maybe another for the physical.

## Physical?
Cursory examination. Turn-your-head- and-cough sort of thing. You'll be out of here in no time.

## You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?
How do I find them? Their offices are empty.

## Where?
I told you, they hired me over the phone. I never met anyone.

## Where'd you pick up your checks?
It was a different floor then...

## Have we met?
Show Mr. Van Orton to his room.

## Didn't I give you two?
No, you didn't...

## You did? How is he?
Okay. I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.

## Is everything alright?
Fine.

## I've finished for the evening. Will you be needing anything else?
No, thank you. Goodnight.

## I don't know what you're talking about. What's happened?
There's been a break in. Lock this door and stay here. Don't move a muscle.

## What makes you ask?
I'm not sure.

## Did you worry about him?
Nobody worried about your father.

## What's the trouble?
You're here for Conrad Van Orton? I'm the hotel manager...

## What's this about?
It's a private matter, for you... I think you'll be more comfortable...

## Where's my brother?
There were complaints by other guests, and damage to his room. We did the best we could to accommodate his behavior.

## His behavior... ?
He couldn't, or refused to pay. We extended credit...

## I'll send your regrets. Honestly, why must I even bother?
Because, if you don't know about society, you don't have the satisfaction of avoiding it.

## What?
A gentleman left a message requesting a lunch, but I assured him...

## What gentleman, Maria?
I don't know what you're talking about. I'm just driving...

## Is Alan Baer \"the Game?\" Is that what this is?
Nothing. Nothing at all.

## How concerned should I be?
It was a misunderstanding.

## Someone's playing hardball. It's complicated. Can I ask a favor?
You know you can.

## Sounds like they make tennis rackets. What do we know?
Just what I told you.

## Christ... I can't believe it... invisible ink?
You're joking.

## What about the house?
Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...

## What?
Every year is a good year.

## And what kind of sleeper?
Well, I... uh...

## Who's Watts?
The children. The children Hugh Crain built the house for. The children he never had.

## Couldn't get the last ones. You?
I did okay.

## Welcome Home Eleanor. Welcome Home? I've never been here. Who did this?
It's somebody's idea of a joke.

## Is this true? I've been hypnotized?
And this is my assistant, Mary Lambretta.

## So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?
That could have been worse.

## Luke, can I talk to you?
Sure.

## Why?
I've read your tests.

## Do we still get paid for the week?
You get your money.

## Is that the question of compassion or science?
It's a question.

## So could you! Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
No.

## Mister very talky, would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you?
We're fucked. We're in a haunted house and we can't get out until the morning.

## You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?
That depends on your definition of ghosts. I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.

## All night?
Yeah.

## You want company?
Was sure she'd be in here.

## Are you working with her?
Mary, I'll meet you outside.

## Does she know that's why you're using her?
No.

## Eleanor, how was the drive?
You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.

## How do you feel about Luke's suggestion that it was just the old plumbing? Water hammer, something like that?
Sorry.

## Nell! What's wrong?
That smell... oh, God.

## What did it smell like?
It was very specific.

## What happened after you smelled it?
I looked at Theo. She had a look on her face.

## Like she smelled it too?
Yes.

## And then what happened?
I got more scared.

## Let's say it wasn't you. Who did it?
I don't know.

## You'll never see it again. Mr. Dudley's taking care of it. I'm sorry, Nell. Can I show you something you'd like to see?
Sure.

## Why?
I don't know.

## What is that tune?
Nell... please, Nell... take a deep breath...

## Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
It's not real? Crain? He's not real?

## Then who called me?
Nothing, if you leave right now. There's a war going on all around us. Don't get in the way, please.

## You're going to publish, he's going to perish... And why did you hire me for this?
You hear the vibrations in the wire. There's a magnetic pulse in the wires, you feel it. I could test it.

## How'd I know it was for you?
Because it's my phone. Yes... Mrs. Dudley, just leave the boxes inside, thank you. See you soon. Thank you.

## What's this? What's this... this picture?
That? That's Hill House.

## What happened?
There were no children. Rene died, and then Hugh Crain built all of this, and then he died. His heart was broken.

## Have either of you seen David Watts?
No, but Nell's been here longer than I have.

## When do we take the tests?
Every day. Basically we'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening.

## Is she asleep?
I'm a scientist. I just conducted an experiment. Now I have to write it up.

## What do you want?
Oh! You scared me.

## Is there something about the house?
Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.

## Who?
Rene Crain. Up there. Rope. Ship's hawser. Hard to tie. Don't know how she got it.

## Why'd she kill herself?
Yes.

## Why?
Can't say. Haven't been here that long. Well, it's Labor Day, gotta get to work.

## They're so beautiful. Aren't they?
I've seen 'em. Lot to dust.

## What did it cost?
Fifteen dollars.

## Wait. You're not wearing that ironically? This is really you?
I don't know what you mean.

## I'm between jobs right now. My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over. So... And you?
That depends.

## A blank canvas! I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not. So, you? Husbands? Boyfriends? Girlfriends? Where do you live?
Jeez.

## You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you?
Yes. I've missed it.

## Yes. I feel realy rested, too. Theo?
I guess. Oh, your hair! It looks good.

## How could he have left without his keys?
Two sets. I don't know. Maybe they're not even his.

## Is it over?
No, it's getting worse.

## Theo... Did you?
Maybe you did it yourself.

## Why?
I don't know. You've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention. Maybe he did it...

## Just think about one thing right now, What color?
I've never had a pedicure before.

## Red. What else?
I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo.

## I'll take that as a compliment. In the city, what kind of place do you live in?
I have a loft.

## You want to move to New York, you want to move in with me?
I don't know, you know...

## Are you sure?
Because I don't want to ruin things. Because home is where the heart is.

## What'd you come back for, babe?
Just had to be sure.

## Is there anything in the world that you want or need?
I want that scary guy in your house.

## Is that a problem?
Not for you, clearly.

## Am I a thing?
Well, you're certainly not a person.

## It's an observation. Like, I'm hungry. When are we eating?
As soon as you get dressed.

## What kind of food?
Anything but Japanese.

## Why?
I'm not into finger foods. Too fussy.

## Italian?
I'm sorry.

## Who?
Not who, food. Should we get Italian.

## What's the matter?
Nothing. I guess it's hard to pass on this road.

## We think?
We can't find ... ... two of our guys.

## Come over here.
Why not?

## How they goin', kid?
Not bad.

## How'd you like to kill someone for me?
Okay.

## Where do we go?
When you find the guy, you'll know.

## Our black friends?
No, Terry. They don't work like that. Jenny Wilson's father paid a little visit, left a message.

## You think I'm staying?
There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.

## Oh really? Where you from?
England. Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing.

## You came to the right place, sir. My wife's second cousin is English. Well, Scotch-Irish. Can I interest you in a holster?
Just luck, this, really. Never been to one of these before.

## Yeah?
No problem. If you don't have a problem with me reporting this gun stolen.

## What'd you call that -- the Protector?
Yes, sir. Won't find a better CQC on the market.

## CQ what?
Close Quarters Combat. Keep one in my own home.

## Edward Rama?
Eduardo. Rama.

## I mean, what has it been -- six months?
Round about, yeah.

## Huh?
Snuffed her.

## Valentine. What's he got to say for himself?
What more is there.

## This ain't your lot?
You kiddin', man? I don't need a wife and screamin' kids. I still got my youth.

## What, tryin' to catch him with another bird?
That's what I thought, man. But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else.

## What you gonna do, man? You gonna go to the cops?
Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.

## Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever?
Not me, man. I'm no drug dealer, what you think.

## What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.

## Are you a resident of California? You gonna fill out forms, man? Do the background check? Go through a three-day waiting period?
Sod that. Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to.

## No. Not at all. Do we?
Not me, man.

## I mean, it's already a steal, n'it -- what you said -- four hundred for this one?
You hadda show up on a weekend. This weekend. Wouldn't've even been a gun show ... for another month.

## It's only insurance. Can't be too careful. This Terry Valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella. They were together how long?
Five years, I think. Long time.

## How'd the two of you hook up, then?
Oh, Jenny was in my acting class.

## Who'd you butcher at the house?
Butcher's hook. Look. I don't much reckon those minders of his.

## Huh?
He's brought in the heavy mob.

## What?
Extra muscle. Bodyguards.

## Has he?
They look a right load of wallies. Patrolling back and forth outside the gate, all ponced up like the fuckin' Household Cavalry. Watch it.

## That was one of them?
See what I mean? Wearing bloomin' uniforms n' all.

## What's so fucking funny?
Those aren't guards. They're valets.

## Valets. What d'ya mean valets. What is he, then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster?
Valets. They park cars. He's having a party.

## What are we standing on?
Faith.

## You goin' back inside?
One thing I need.

## Too easy?
He's gotta know why.

## You think a fuckin' guy like that ever will? What more do you want, man?
I've been wondering something.

## Do you have any friends, man?
Yeah, I suppose. Call 'em that, yeah. Down the boozer Saturday night. Meet some of the lads.

## Not much -- you?
Same.

## Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?
Probably.

## You just cooking then?
Hell, no. I started writing.

## Hey, Elaine. You even know what he's saying half the time?
No, but I know what he means.

## No, why did you come here?
Sort a few things out.

## How d'you mean?
It's been a while.

## In any case, I don't suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel.
What was that, then?

## Here, are you always this sarky?
Sarcastic, moi? Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in. It's expected any day now. I'm all packed and ready to go.

## If it played in England somebody owes me money. Who told you that -- Eddie?
Said it went on for donkey's years.

## Now who's being sarcastic?
When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean.

## When did you get in?
Yesterday. Afternoon.

## The address Jenny gave me, that wasn't a prison, was it?
Nah, accommodation address.

## Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?
-- Mr. Lindgren.

## Who's Mr. Lindgren?
My employer.

## In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren?
This and that. Y'know. Ways and means.

## And how did you get it?
Early 70's. I was away. Maidstone. Possibly Brixton.

## These more highlights from the Zagat prison guide?
You don't seem bothered.

## Hey?
From pursuing your chosen profession.

## Did you. What was that in aid of?
Who remembers.

## You have been away. Or is all this just new to you?
It's true. Has to be said. I got off to a slow start.

## You ever been to London?
Only in the movies.

## What about your grandmother?
Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod.

## He alive to see this?
Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill. Watching Doris Day.

## What'd your father do?
Black market during the war.

## Won't he be looking for you about now?
Good luck to him. He couldn't find his prick if he didn't wear Y-fronts.

## Do us a favor. Can't even go have a slash without 'em saying, what're you going in there for?
I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole.

## Where's Big Sur?
Up the coast.

## How far?
I don't know -- few hours, I guess.

## Fancy it?
I could use a vacation. Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this is a vacation.

## What's in Big Sur?
That's where Valentine's scarpered.

## How do you know?
Bloke told me.

## So what's your beef, pal?
It was you. Downtown.

## Eh?
No, I can reassure you on that point. Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.

## All of what?
Of the deal, man.

## What am I doing?
Valentine had himself a party, I hear.

## Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown? There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead. Any of this ring a bell?
My client is an entrepreneur. I am his lawyer, not his business manager.

## Where is he now?
He had urgent business in the north.

## Ian?
I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London.

## You sure?
Unless I'm not who I think I am.

## Yeah?
Turned that place completely around. 180 degrees.

## What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying?
Right. Chain of respect. That's good, that.

## Where else?
Out on a oil rig. In the North Sea. Nine years.

## Nine years? Is that legal?
But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.

## Makin' trouble for someone?
Yeah.

## Which kind?
The forever kind.

## Two blacks and a Mexican in a car. Who's driving?
I don't know.

## What d'you mean, any happier?
Any happier than any other asshole in life.

## There is?
Something's on.

## What?
I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation.

## You do?
You bet.

## What's in it?
Drugs? Cash? Both if we're lucky.

## How we gonna get that lucky?
While they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in.

## He's expecting you?
I doubt it.

## Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt. Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions?
Hello there.

## What are you doing here?
Exercising my visitation rights.

## Since when?
I miss my kids.

## What kind of trouble are you in?
No trouble.

## Is he here?
Go now.

## Ann. Will you come in?
...I'm so sorry about your loss.

## Yes, Ann?
And you should tell Doris...

## Yes?
We went camping last summer. In Eugene, Oregon. of Eugene, Ed.

## ...Yes?
Sometimes knowledge is a curse, Ed. After this happened, things changed. Big Dave... he never touched me again.

## ...You don't like the music out there?
It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really. I'm not big on music, ordinarily.

## Who?
Beethoven. He created it, and yet he never actually heard it. I suppose he heard it all in his head, somehow.

## ...I stank, didn't I?
He didn't say that.

## I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?
No. Uh... family friend.

## I speak to you on ze phone, non? You have a special interest in music?
Uh-huh.

## Well? How'd she do?
Ze girl?... She seems like a very nice girl. She, monsieur, like a very nice girl. Ztinks. Very nice girl. However, ztinks.

## Did she make mistakes?
Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the right note, always. Very proper.

## Huh.
A goose, friend. I was chasing a wild goose. Ed, have you ever heard of venture capital?

## ...Ed Crane. Remember? Today?
Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.

## I can get it, yeah.
...I didn't recognize you without the smock. Did I--damn--did I leave something at the shop?

## Sure.
Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?

## What's involved, aside from putting up the money? What're you looking for the partner to do?
I'll have it in a week.

## ...Was that a pass?
Maybe.

## ...You bring a check?
Sure.

## Look, uh... Creighton...
Yeah, screw 'em, huh? Pay 'em to tangle it up and then you pay 'em to untangle it, what's the point?

## OK.
...You're not gonna screw me on this?

## ...Were you in the service, Ed?
No, Dave, I wasn't.

## How's business, Dave?
All right, I guess.

## ...Say, where do you get those things anyway?
Specialty store down in Sacramento.

## What is it, Dave?
Uh-huh.

## How much to they want, Dave?
$10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.

## ...You know... who is?
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.

## ...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?
Mm.

## Your place?
I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.

## ...Dave?
Come on in.

## Just coffee.
So you paid the guy?

## You sure you don't want something stiffer?
...Doesn't become a matter of public record unless there's foul play. However. I don't believe I'm were the man, I'd want to be told.

## Told what?
I, uh... thanks.

## Honey?
Mm.

## Where you going?
Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.

## Who?
Dave.

## How's that?
Ahh...

## Mm.
So?

## ...What's so damn strange about that?
I didn't say a word.

## What happened to you?
...I don't know what happened to Big Dave. I know some of it. Irregularities in my books, they said. Can I explain it.

## Should I... should I tell you why?
You don't have to tell me anything.

## Good! Any questions give me a ring-- Turandot suite; if I'm out leave a message. You sure you don't want anything? No?
I knew about it. Big Dave told me about it, and the spot he was putting himself in by getting the money.

## OK, we forget the blackmail. killed him. How come?
He and Doris... were having an affair.

## OK, how did you know?
I... just knew. A husband knows.

## Will anyone else say they knew?
I don't know. I don't think so.

## How did you get into the store?
I took Doris's keys.

## Will anyone say they saw you there? On your way there? In there? On your was back?
...I don't think so.

## Will anyone corroborate and goddamn part of your story at all?
...I don't get it.

## Oh, hell. Drink?
No thanks.

## Sure you don't need one?
I'm fine.

## He a good man?
I'm fine. Thanks.

## Ed, how're you holding up?
I'm OK, Walter, thanks.

## Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?
I don't work here. My wife does.

## Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?
Yeah.

## ...Did you make that up?
Oh, no. That was written by Mr Ludwig van Beethoven.

## Huh?
Russians exploded an A-bomb.

## Sportsmanship! That's my point. June fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? Well, what fish do you seek?
Yeah.

## ...You sure, Eddie?
Yeah, yeah--go home.

## Huh?
This hair.

## Whuddya mean?
I don't know... How it keeps on coming. It just keeps growing.

## Yeah--lucky for us, huh, pal?
No, I mean it's growing, it's part of us. And we cut it off. And throw it away.

## ...How you today, Ed?
OK.

## You don't got a headache?
...Nah.

## ...We goin'?
Huh? No.

## Huh?
They sent us to tell ya. We pulled the detail.

## My?
Birdy...

## Mr...?
Crane. Ed Crane.

## My name is Diedrickson. County medical examiner.
You also have an interest in the securing property?

## Doesn't bother me.
Yeah?

## OK, boys, which of you gets the privilege?
We're just closing, friend.

## Sure. Can Ed come too?
He's a barber.

## Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious?
His eyes are open.

## As soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you. Does he understand that? We're supposed to tell him. Are you conscious?
You'll go to the prison hospital.

## He said OK. Is that what he said?
Uh, Vince. Sorry. This won't wait.

## I'm sorry, sir. You okay?
Someone broke into this room.

## Anything missin'?
Doesn't look like it. We're damned lucky. This statue is priceless.

## Why not?
No one broke into this room, sir. Someone broke out. That lock was torn off from the inside.

## Do they have to wear uniforms?
Yes.

## Where's the walk-in safe?
Behind you.

## What's the combination?
I'll do it. Just let me find my portable phone.

## The cops are non-negotiable, Ippolito. Why don't you just tell me how this space station works.
Fifteen... what's next?

## Where the hell are you?
I made it outside. I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here. Help is on the way. Just sit tight.

## Who are you? The undertaker?
Special Agent Pendergast. FBI.

## Vince D'Agosta. Am I out?
Not at all. I think we may be working on the same case. If so, I could use your help.

## The body?
What's left of it.

## Mind if I have a look?
We need light in here, stat.

## Where's the head?
Careful. That mess on the ground is brains.

## Whose footprints?
Night watchman who found the body. Sweet old man. Been tossing his cookies for over an hour. Not a likely suspect.

## I drink. After hours of course. On duty, I smoke. Do you mind?
Not at all. I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.

## So the method of death is the only connection?
No. There's more. There were crates from this museum in the hold of the boat.

## How do you explain the part about Beauregard?
They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story. Nice touch.

## You think what we've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells... like hamburger?
No. I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.

## What happened to them?
If you don't mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test.

## Saliva test? You mean, you think someone ate part of the brain?
Correct.

## How big is the sub-basement?
Apparently it's huge.

## The sub-basement?
I've been down there. It links up to the old sewer system. I can guide you out.

## Shouldn't a drug that powerful be destroyed?
Lieutenant! It's me.

## I know.
What is it?

## How much ammo do we have to make a stand?
You're asking me? I don't even know how to load this thing.

## What does it say?
Dr. John Whittlesley.

## What's that doing here?
I don't know. I thought Dr. Whittlesley died in South America.

## Dear God. Where are we, Lieutenant?
I'd say we're in its home.

## What are we talking about here?
Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.

## Right. The entire brain appears to have been extracted. May I see it, please?
Curious. There's something missing.

## The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
Yes. Two organs the size of a walnut have been removed with what looks like surgical precision.

## What is it?
Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui. John used it as packing material.

## What are they?
They're eggs.

## Some kind of power failure. Maybe it's the storm. Do you have a flashlight?
I think so.

## Dr. Frock. Did you hear that?
Don't stop now.

## Dr. Frock?
Look who's here, Margo.

## Do you mean Dr. Whittlesley?
Yes. John made quite a study of the whole museum. He had a copy of my original plans.

## Are there any hidden rooms or staircases? Places where someone could hide?
Not really. Just the sub-basement.

## Where is that?
I don't know. It was walled over. No one's been down there in years.

## You said you had plans of the museum. Could we see them, please?
We think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate.

## Dr. Frock, I was wondering. What happened to the rest of Whittlesley's plants?
They were sent to the Center For Disease Control in Atlanta.

## You work here?
Yes, I do.

## Nothing. I'm in third grade. What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
He's right. Follow me.

## It's alright. I can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone. What is this place?
Not on the map. Looks like it connects with the city sewer.

## Jesus, what is this?
Another storage room.

## What?
Frock's been fired.

## For once I'm glad you're rumor central. What in the world is going on?
Someone's been murdered. Not shot, strangled or stabbed, either. Torn limb from limb. There's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal.

## What do you make of it, Margo?
It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian.

## What kind of egg is it?
Is Dr. Frock safe!

## How about lunch?
Not today. Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.

## How does it work?
No. I came to talk about Dr. John Whittlesley.

## Somehow, when all this happened... I knew it would come back to John. Is he really dead?
Maybe not.

## And John?
Disappeared. His body wasn't among the victims.

## How did you know that?
That was two years ago. John was still in love with me. He wouldn't leave me alone.

## Tell me about the last expedition. What was he looking for?
A legendary monster called Mbwun.

## What happened?
No one knows. The Kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals.

## What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there? Was he desperate enough to create one?
I don't understand.

## I don't think so. I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun. Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?
I don't know. He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation. But I've never seen it. It's in the exhibit.

## Where would we find it?
I'm not sure. We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.

## What happened?
I don't know.

## Where did you see it?
Behind me. Over there.

## I didn't imagine it. I know what I saw. Are you sure there are enough men in there?
They're all heavily armed.

## What was it?
I don't know. Mr. Pendergast. Do me a favor. Get me a DNA readout on that claw.

## Genetic damage?
We need someone to take us to the secure storage area.

## Pendergast? Are you all right?
No. I think I'm hallucinating.

## You're not. Where is it?
Gone.

## Wounded?
It's scared of me.

## What happened?
Its eyesight is worse than I thought. It couldn't see us. And it couldn't smell us through the glass.

## It didn't want the fibers. What does that mean?
I think... it means it's full.

## Then it won't go after the others?
No. It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.

## For what?
I'm in town on a case. Dropped by to see Vince and we thought we'd see the new display.

## I'm sorry to keep you. How can I help?
I want to book a flight to Fiji.

## Where in Fiji? What island?
I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.

## Viti Levu. For how many?
One.

## When do you want to leave, remembering, of course, you do lose a day on the way there?
Today.

## Why wouldn't I?
I thought you were in a hurry.

## You want to book the flight?
It doesn't matter. I'll make other arrangements.

## Close up?
No, hold back...

## Why is he in the basement?
He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left.

## What happened down there?
He was tidying up his garbage. I was going to call you. But half-way through, he gave up and fell asleep.

## All prop cars accounted for?
He has to be on foot. He has the world's most recognizable face. He can't disappear.

## What have we missed?
It's just a matter of time.

## What music?
Storm music...Wagner...

## How do you intend to explain his twenty- two year absence?
Amnesia.

## A window onto the human condition?
I prefer to think of it as a mirror.

## We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort. Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?
Let's go to some of those viewers' calls.

## Are we talking Emmies?
Certainly a nomination.

## You've never actually met Truman, yourself. Never thought about doing a cameo--playing a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that?
I'm the creator.

## The creator of what?
A show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.

## A show. Then who am I?
You're the star.

## What's he doing?
They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.

## But why didn't he just follow her to Fiji?
Because his mother got sick - very sick. He couldn't leave her. He's a kind boy, maybe too kind.

## How can they have a child?
It's not gonna be his, you idiot.

## You think she'd go through with it?
Sure she would.

## Lauren, right?
That's right. Lauren.

## No? Really? Good, I mean, I thought possibly a pizza. How about Friday?
No.

## Saturday?
Actually, I'm free Sunday.

## Well, what do you want to do?
I think I've studied enough.

## It's beautiful! What are you waiting for?
I...I can't.

## Outta my job, outta Seahaven, off this island...out!
Yeah? Outta what?

## Nursery?
Truman, you know, I did think about moving away one time.

## You think so?
Trust me.

## Sure. It's halogen. Shame it didn't hit you - you could've sued. You coming for a drink?
I've got to talk to you.

## Mixed up? Mixed up in what?
No. Truman, if this is another one of your fantasies...

## Who?
It's hard to tell. They look just like regular people.

## How about them?
I told you I can't.

## What're we doing here, Truman?
This is where it started.

## What exactly?
No.

## When you were hauling chickens for Kaiser Poultry, what was the furthest you ever went off the island?
I went all over but I never found a place like this. Look at that sunset, Truman. It's perfect.

## I don't know what to think, Marlon. Maybe I'm going out of my mind, but I get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow.
Really?

## What's that?
The thing that started all of this.

## What's that?
It's a surprise.

## Well, what do you think?
They're... perfect. Thank you.

## How did it go today?
A man tripped and fell on a chainsaw. We got three of his fingers back on.

## Maybe I feel like a teenager.
Did something happen today?

## We're mortgaged to the eyeballs, Truman. There's the car payments. Are we just going to walk away from our financial obligations?
It'd be an adventure.

## I thought we were going to try for a baby. Isn't that enough of an adventure?
That can wait. I want to get away. See some of the world. Explore.

## What're you doing down here?
Fixing the mower. I saw my father today.

## How do you know?
Your mother called. You shouldn't upset her like that.

## What did you want?
I made macaroni.

## Come on, Truman. Haven't you studied enough?
I still want to look over a couple of things.

## I'll take you home, Angela. Why don't you leave those with us for a while?
Good night, Mother.

## What's the hurry?
Arrah!

## You're upset because you want to go to Fiji. Is that it?
You hate gambling.

## Because I never have. That's why you go places, isn't it?
Truman, I think I'm going to throw up.

## I think I'd like a little company.
Blocked at every turn. Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?

## It's hard to go places, isn't it?
There's been an accident, Truman.

## Truman, what about that sign?
I'm sure they're just exaggerating.

## So what do we do for money when we get to New Orleans?
Well, I made it through another night.

## How's your hip?
Oh, just so.

## I feel certain my condition runs in the family. Can't this wait, dear?
We ought to be getting you back, Mother.

## Sure. Okay. Fine. Can you pass on a message?
I'll try.

## When you get to Fiji?
You got it.

## Now what?
Leak at the plant. They had to shut her down.

## Is there any way around?
The whole area's being evacuated.

## Who?
--It doesn't matter. Everybody knows about it. They know everything you do. The point is, you got scared.

## How's it going, Truman?
Not bad. I just won the State Lottery.

## Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?
I'd ask for identification.

## Do you live around here?
Yeah.

## You're not supposed to talk about it? Who told you that?
I think you better tell us.

## Poopy day?
Yup.

## What do you do?
I think that about does it, Spooky.

## Sorry. Don't have one.
Does what?

## What am I doing here?
You were shot in the head. The bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.

## I need your clothes, Byers.
When was that?

## You've been back to Dallas?
Agent Mulder.

## What is it you find incredible?
No, they don't.

## MAN Brought on by what?
MAN This man's still alive.

## MAN How can this be?
The developing organism is using his life energy, digesting bone and tissue. We've just slowed the process.

## Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?
MAN No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.

## And if it's unsuccessful?
MAN Incinerate it. Like the others.

## Of what?
Yes.

## Who called this meeting?
MAN Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane in Tunis.

## Into what?
My lateness may have well been absence. A course has already been taken.

## Do they know?
MAN Mulder was in Dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence. He's gone back there again. Someone has tipped him.

## Who?
MAN Kurtzweil, we think.

## You got some kind of business with him?
I'm looking for him.

## What's that?
Selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer.

## You looking for him for some other reason?
Yeah, I had an appointment for a pelvic examination.

## You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?
No. Don't bother.

## Have you examined them?
No. Just fossils, far as I know.

## How's that?
Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.

## Do I know you?
No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that.

## You follow me out here for a reason?
Yeah, I did.

## I know the name. Why?
Old friend of your father's.

## How'd you find me?
Heard you come here now and again. Figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight.

## You a reporter?
I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN.

## Who sent you?
I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas.

## And what's that?
S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.

## What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building?
The Federal Building was too well guarded.

## Before the bomb went off?
That's what I'm saying.

## You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?
And one little boy.

## Do you?
See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.

## They want to discredit you -- for what?
For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth.

## I don't either, but it sure sells books.
You know my work?

## How?
I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.

## You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.

## What killed those men?
What killed them I won't even write about. I tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. They have the future to protect.

## Negotiating with whom?
And they tell me I'm paranoid.

## How can I reach you?
You can't.

## You found something?
Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.

## What do you think?
A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus.

## Your guess?
I'm on the roof.

## Did you find something?
No. I haven't.

## What's wrong, Scully?
Jesus, Mulder...

## How's that?
You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol.

## It's locked?
Had you.

## Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
I just did. You're buying.

## Alright... what'll it be, Coke, Pepsi? A saline IV?
Something sweet.

## Where are you, Mulder?
I'm in the vending room.

## Scully?
Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it.

## What? What are you talking about?
I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...

## Why?
I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.

## You're... quitting?
There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore. Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.

## I wake you?
No.

## Are you drunk, Mulder?
I was until about an hour ago.

## What are you implying, Scully?
I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.

## Is that what you'd like me to do?
Go home, Mulder. It's late.

## Mulder -- what are you doing?
Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.

## This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas?
According to this tag.

## And you're looking for?
It's like jelly.

## You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?
I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.

## Why are you whispering?
I can't really talk right now.

## What did you find?
Evidence of a massive infection.

## How was it contracted?
He didn't mention a park.

## You're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman's body in the morgue?
The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.

## This looks like new grass to you?
It looks pretty green for this climate.

## Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?
I don't know, Mulder.

## And where are they going with it?
That's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them.

## What are my choices?
About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.

## Where would they be going?
We've got two choices. One of them is wrong.

## You think they went left?
I don't know why I think they went right.

## Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?
This is great. This is fitting.

## What?
We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --

## What do you mean by haul? What are you not telling me here?
This virus -- it...

## What do you think it is?
I have no idea.

## Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there.

## You hear that?
I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.

## Yeah...?
Run.

## Where'd they go?
I don't know.

## What? What's wrong?
Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.

## What? What happened?
I think... something stung me.

## Where are we?
You got me. But I think I know what they did with Jimmy Hoffa.

## On whose orders?
GUARD General McAddie's.

## About what?
-- They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building.

## Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
And they want to blame us?

## How deep does this go?
I don't know.

## Are we being watched?
I'm not taking any chances.

## What are you doing?
I've got to find Scully.

## What happened to Kurtzweil?
He's come and gone.

## Where's Scully?
I have answers for you.

## Is she alive?
Yes.

## About the conspiracy?
I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.

## What is it?
A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours.

## This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
No! For God sake you've got it all backwards.

## What do you mean, walked?
Until Dallas, we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism. That mass infection would make us a slave race.

## Why are you telling me this?
I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.

## What happened to Kurtzweil?
As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.

## Where is he?
Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk.

## What alien environment?
Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future.

## What about you?
My life is over. Go.

## More concerns than that?
We've been forced to reassess our role in Colonization by new facts of biology which have presented themselves.

## We've allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us?
No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank.

## And Mulder?
You can't kill Mulder. He's got too much light on him.

## Did we go sailing?
Almost. Mocky-Lock showed up.

## Lucien Baines?
She adores you.

## Why not? Just once. A trial run. What harm could it do?
I don't want to find out.

## You're sure? Any more nightmares?
No.

## Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about. Want to come?
I've got to feed my cat. Besides, I want to get to bed early.

## A pocketful of fucking rye. What's wrong?
Nothing.

## The first... What? Six or seven times I went in. Remember what happened?
Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.

## What happened?
...a pocketful of rye.

## What's wrong?
Agent Novak. I didn't get a chance to clear him.

## What if he wasn't like this? What if he was \"normal?\" Conscious. How far would you go?
As far as I needed.

## How hard could it be...?
This man is deeply disturbed, he...

## No. Not at all. From what I understand, he knows I\"m here, isn't that right?
It doesn't have much to do with science.

## What then?
The soul. The spirit. Whatever you want to call it.

## Do you feel there's a side of yourself you don't show people?
Absolutely. I suppose everyone does.

## That's what therapists are for, right?
With Stargher I saw things...

## Why'd you bring him here?
You're the shrink, you tell me.

## You think you can do this, don't you?
He might tell me about Julia. The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse. Who wants to be redeemed.

## Whoa. Hold on. Aren't they the same guy?
Evil.

## What difference does it make...?
Tell me.

## You're sure of that?
Yes. I am.

## Where the hell are we?
Carl, do you know? Like on a map...

## You sure about this?
Absolutely. Abigail...

## He's mine?
All yours. My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had.

## You liked him?
He's beautiful...

## What now?
s broken.

## Who says?
Mocky-Lock.

## She the one from Santa Cruz?
Just graduated law school. Single mom. Had a two-year-old daughter.

## Yep. And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
You're kidding me.

## Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?
They took care of that, thank you, Henry.

## What's wrong?
It would take hours to re-route the system, and even if I did, I shouldn't.

## When did he lapse into the coma?
Sometime yesterday morning.

## What about the legalities of this...?
Catherine!

## Nervous?
Absolutely.

## I have to ask you some things... Are you taking any prescription drugs?
Prevacid. For my stomach.

## Any psychiatric medication?
No.

## What about narcotics?
No.

## Is she alright?
Yes. But you're going to sit down right now. I have to...

## What about the cat?
Completely unaware.

## Someone looking after her little girl?
Grandparents. Live over in Davis.

## So?
Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.

## Now?
Now.

## How is she?
Pregnant. Thanks for asking.

## After three years she remembers what the guy drove?
She remembers because it was her \"dream truck.\" Wanted one just like it.

## No. Can you get a man close?
I don't have to.

## Next time, tell me, okay?
But you looked so cute. All sleepy...

## You're bettin' the farm on something you saw after they pumped you full of god knows-what kind of shit?
I saw her. Julia. Alive. I saw everything.

## Do you understand German?
No, no...oh...excuse me.

## No, he never told me about his friends. Would you like some tea?
Well, I saw you at the funeral.

## You were in love with him, weren't you?
I don't know. How can you know a thing like that afterwards. I don't know anything any more.

## I was talking to another friend of Harry's. A Baron Kurtz - do you know him?
No.

## Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
The doctor Harry used to go to. He was passing just after it happened.

## His own doctor?
Yes.

## Were you at the inquest?
Yes. They said it wasn't the driver's fault. Harry often said what a careful driver he was.

## He was Harry's driver?
Mmmm.

## What's she talking about?
The police. They're searching my room. Sie mussen doch wissen.

## Anything really wrong with your papers?
They're forged.

## Why?
The Russians would claim me. I come from Czechoslovakia.

## Oh, what was the name of that doctor? Harry's doctor?
Dr. Winkel.

## Drink?
Whiskey.

## Who are you looking for now?
Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.

## Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?
Just another part I've got to learn.

## I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?
Comedy. I don't play tragedy.

## What's that?
\"Ein hurigan\" - I guess.

## When...what did you do?
Oh, we didn't make much sense. Drank too much. Once he tried...

## Where is she?
Oh, that was many years ago.

## What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
I thought you wanted...

## That's Harry's place, isn't it?
Yes.

## What's the matter?
Let's not get into any more trouble.

## What are you going to do?
I wish I knew.

## Wer ist da?
Me.

## I thought you were going to go away. Aren't the police after you?
I don't know.

## What happened to your hand?
A parrot...Let it go.

## Have you?
...you know.

## He told you, didn't he?
He's better dead. I know he was mixed up - but not like that.

## Are you going, too?
Oh...

## How did you know I would be here?
...Headquarters.

## Have you been seeing Major Calloway again?
Harry.

## Hide? Can't a fellow have a drink?
Here, it will be cold on that train.

## What is going to happen? Where is Harry?
He's safe in the Russian zone.

## How do you know?
I saw him today.

## Did he say anything about me - tell me?
Oh, the usual things...

## There's something wrong. Did you tell Calloway about meeting Harry?
Of course I didn't tell Calloway.

## ...anyway?
From Kurtz. They have just been arrested. But Harry won't come, he's not a fool.

## Good evening, Miss Schmidt. You remember me?
Of course.

## Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?
Thank you.

## Do you know this man?
I have never seen him.

## Now then, Miss Schmidt, I'm not interested in your forged papers - that's purely a Russian case. When did you last see Lime?
Two weeks ago.

## It's true then?
Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin.

## Where's Harry?
That's what we want to find out.

## Must you take those?
They'll be returned, miss.

## Where?
Just around the corner.

## How will I know you?
I'll carry a copy of one of your books. Harry gave it to me.

## What is it?
This is forgery. It is very clever.

## We are interested in this case. Have you arrested the girl?
No, not yet.

## Please keep this passport to yourself, until I make some inquiries, will you, Major?
Yes, of course.

## Can I have that woman's passport?
Can you tell me whose...

## You a friend of Lime's?
Yes.

## Been here long?
No.

## When did you see him last?
September '39.

## See much of him before that?
Once in a while.

## I'm afraid I've never heard of you. What's your name again?
Holly Martins.

## What?
Him dying like that.

## What are you trying to say?
He was...

## Ever seen one?
Pin it on a...

## Why don't you catch a few murderers for a change?
Well, you could say that murder was part...

## What the devil?
Getting around, Martins.

## Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?
Calloway.

## You're not locking her up?
Get the next plane.

## What do you want to see a doctor for, huh?
A bruised lip.

## Well?
In Vienna...

## Are you too busy chasing a few tubes of penicillin to investigate a murder?
That is the racket Harry Lime organized.

## Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
Fifty yards right down there.

## Which side of the road?
I was on that side, the shadow was on that side, and no turnings on either side.

## How about the doorway?
I tell you I heard him running ahead of me.

## Didn't I?
You all did.

## Win what?
I'll be your dumb decoy duck.

## What time is it?
Two thirty.

## Calloway, can't you do something about Anna?
I'll do what I can, if she'll let me.

## Please be careful, sir. Up we come. Written anything lately?
Take him to Sacher's.

## Shall I go over there, sir?
No, no. Leave them for a while.

## Do you know his number?
No, I don't know...

## You do!
Well, look, is there a car here I can use?

## Welcome?
They wouldn't know me.

## How long can one stay here on this stage money?
Listen, Mr. Martins, if you'd agree to be our guest, we'd be delighted to have you.

## Heard of Harry Lime?
Certainly.

## What about?
On the modern novel - you remember what we arranged and we want you to talk on the Crisis of Faith.

## What's that?
Oh, I thought you would know, you're a writer. Of course you do. Good night, old man.

## What is it, Sergeant?
Mr. Holly Martins, sir.

## Who?
The author. Thought you might be interested.

## Very popular. Are you staying long?
...leaving tomorrow, sir.

## What can I do, old man, I'm dead, aren't I?
You can help her.

## ...exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?
I told the police.

## You don't care anything at all about Anna, do you?
Well, I've got quite a lot on my mind.

## What do you want me to do?
You can get somebody else...

## Why not?
It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...

## As long as they can use you?
I wish I could get rid of this thing.

## You told them, didn't you?
Don't try to be a policeman, old man.

## Do you know, I don't ever feel comfortable on these sort of things...Victims?
...this way.

## Mr. Martins. Delighted to meet you. Come let's sit down here. Ober! Zwei. What would you like. Tea? Coffee?
Coffee.

## At the end of every chapter --
You really liked it?

## Here?
...were of you.

## What did he say?
...you know and all that.

## Well, there was only you, and this friend of his. Who is he?
A Roumanian.

## What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
Will you give me...

## ...your address?
I live in the Russian sector, but you'll find me at the Casanova Club every night. One has to work...

## What's the name of this girl?
Not yet.

## The Roumanian?
Yes. The man who helped carry him.

## Are you mad?
All right - I'm mad. I've seen a ghost...

## Dr. Winkel?
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.

## Find out?
Hear the details.

## Could he have been at all conscious?
I understand...

## In great pain?
Not necessarily.

## English?
Already gone.

## Coffin?
Mr. Lime's. Accident...

## Did you know Mr. Lime well?
Mr. Lime - yes.

## What does he say?
Sehen sie da gleich da unter. Da unten ist est passiert. Passiert - English.

## What's he saying?
Happened...Yes happened right down there.

## Oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?
Er, alive? He couldn't have been alive, not with his head in the way it was.

## Who else?
Kurtz.

## The Roumanian?
Yes.

## And?
There was a third man - he didn't give evidence.

## You don't mean that doctor?
No, no. He came late after they carried him to the Joseph Statue.

## Two double whiskeys. Was wunschen sie?
I thought there was something funny about the whole thing.

## Funny?
Something wrong.

## Wasn't he at the police inquiry?
He didn't want to get involved.

## What else did he tell you?
That Harry was dead before you got him to that statue.

## A novel, Mr. Martins?
Mr. Martins...

## Should I make it all fact?
Why no, Mr. Martins.

## ...Mr. Martins?
Never.

## What's the purpose of your visit here?
A friend of mine offered me a job here.

## Where are you staying?
With him. Fifteen Stiffgasse.

## His name?
Lime. Harry Lime.

## Yes?
I'm Daffy.

## Help you out?
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.

## Thanks.
Look I don't care about the money right now, I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet -

## What are you doing in Thailand? Tourist?
Traveler.

## Yes, of course I can swim. How far do you think it is?
One or two kilometers.

## We're going to swim \"one or two kilometers\" across open sea, from one uninhabited island to another. Something goes wrong. What then?
Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.

## So?
We think in miles, not kilometers.

## So how many miles do you think it is?
I have no idea but it looks like a long way.

## Everyone ok?
I don't know, just a fin. Over there. About a hundred meters.

## Big?
She just went under the water. She was pulled under. Oh God, I don't see her.

## What about Moliere?
Fuck off.

## Two.
You can swim?

## Richard?
Bonsoir.

## Did you sleep well?
Not too bad.

## So from there to there?
We swim.

## Have you told someone?
No.

## Too far?
If it's too far, then we'll drown. But if we dont try then we'll never know.

## Exactly. Always happened to someone else.
Where did you lose it?

## So?
So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach.

## But, Danny, if HaShem is everything, and we are nothing how are we to judge His actions?
We have free will and intelligence -- which God allegedly gave us....

## You think?! Based on what?
What are you doing here, I thought you were a Nazi.

## What's a fascist?
I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi. He always was.

## Are you shitting me? Right in the store?
She's been giving me the eye. She's hot. So I wait till the owner goes up front....

## What?
That was an ark, man. That was a Torah. They fucked around with it, and the Torah melted their faces.

## Who the fuck are you?
Who am I? Who are you, you schmucks, you can't even make a decent swastika.... Give me the paint. Give it to me.

## What, do you like it here?
Read Mein Kampf? Hitler had all his best ideas in prison.

## Do we have to listen to this shit?
Yes.

## Why'd we have to leave so fast?
Oh, please...

## What do you care?
I don't, but...

## Yeah, but not on the letters.
How come you know all this shit?

## Why the fuck not?
Just don't.

## Have you read Toynbee? Spengler?
Nobody reads that stuff anymore.

## Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?
The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.

## Disease? What disease?
Abstraction. They're obsessed with abstraction.

## Which is what?
At first, no one will know why the victims are being killed.

## You're not in school? What do you do?
I work at the Big Boy warehouse. In Queens. I drive a fork-lift.

## Where'd you read all that stuff?
I just read it....

## Why no silencer?
They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met.

## Are they still together?
He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on.

## Is he a Nazi?
I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.

## What's he care about?
Killing himself.

## That's stupid. Why would they?
You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends.

## Oh, really?
Bigger and better.

## When can I see you?
You can't.

## Your father?
He's at a home out here.

## Where'd you get this?
I stole it. From a synagogue.

## How come there's no punctuation?
Do you know it like that? By heart.

## What do you care?
Cause I want to know.... What is this word? This one here...

## What's it mean?
I want to learn to read it.

## Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?
Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.

## Why not?
They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....

## Who gets contaminated, the Jews or the gentiles?
Good question. Both. Aleph...

## Where are they?
The sex is better.

## Even though his dick is so big?
With you there's a tragic dimension.

## What's it about?
About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick....

## And belief follows?
Fuck that.

## Why should I submit?
You shouldn't.

## You think I should just because there's no reason?
No, I think you shouldn't.

## What...? You think I'm Jewish?
It's all you talk about. Jewish, Jewish, Jewish. Nobody talks about it that much except the Jews.

## Do they?
The real Nazis. Hitler, Goebbels, they talked about Jews incessantly.... You ever read their diaries?...

## Believe me, Adolf Hitler couldn't possibly have hated the Jews as much as I do. Not in a billion years. You know why?
Cause he wasn't a rabbi.

## You want a punch in the mouth?
Okay... Why don't we light candles on Friday? Let's light candles.... And say the kaddish.

## Come on, we can be like Eichmann. He studied Torah. He hated Jews.
You can't. Do you know how many people I've brought into...the movement...?

## Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing?
I don't know. I just want to try it.

## No. What are you looking for?
Nothing. Why are you doing this? I thought God didn't exist.

## Yeah, okay. But what if...what if... submitting...being crushed, being nothing, not mattering, what if that's the best feeling we can have?
I didn't realize you cared.

## Did you know that there was a New York Times reporter there that night?
Really, which one? I bet it was the guy with the Prada shoes.

## I doubt it. How did you find out?
He called me up. He wanted to talk to me about my ideas.

## Who's Eichmann?!!?
Shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod.

## What'd you say?
Nothing. Let's go....

## Why are you taking that?
I'm stealing it.

## Did you see how they reacted to him?
It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been.

## He's Jewish? Manzetti?
We need intellectuals, we have enough thugs already.

## People hate Jews. Do you agree?
They used to. Today it's not an issue.

## You wouldn't announce it?
I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.

## ...Insulting people who were in the camps. ...What's the point?
They're liars and cowards.

## I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out?
It's the truth....

## What about Mrs. Moebius and...?
A week or so. There's something I want to do here first.

## No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?
I'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next....I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting.

## What about Curtis Zampf?
Curtis is a politician -- and a bit of a hustler. He's not a thinker.

## What should I be, a white inferior- ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian? Let me ask, where are your people from?
My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally.

## A poison...?
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.

## I don't know. Is that right?
And Jewish men like to get it.

## Why?
Because the Jew is essentially female.

## Does that mean the Jew is the better lover?
You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.

## Danny, what makes you think you know all this?
Let's just say I've done due diligence.

## Who? How would I know him?
He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.

## You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
So you're saying it's not true.

## That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here?
Listen to me....

## Why would Nadelman lie?
Give me a reason not to.

## Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?
No.

## How do you reconcile the two?
I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand.

## It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would. Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
Get the fuck away from me.

## Why did you come tonight? To see me?
To hear them read Torah.

## How did you...?
I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.

## You're telling me you killed him? You? Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of gun did you use?
A forty-five.

## The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.

## You shut up. Who do you think you are?
There's a bomb here. It's going to go off at seven-thirty.

## How did you get the fucking number?
Daniel Balint.

## Balint?
It's German.

## What part of Germany are you people from?
From the Rhineland originally.

## Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?
I was going to ask you the same thing.

## So what Jew would you kill first?
Ilio Manzetti...former ambassador to France. Managing partner at Damon, Schwarzchild.

## You mean Ilio Manzetti?
Forget Manzetti.... Take on something simple. Something you can actually accomplish. Maybe he'd be more valuable in the city.

## How have things been going?
Fine.

## Hello...?
Lina... It's happening. Tonight.

## What is happening?
Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.

## What about chicken?
That's meat.

## But you already talked about it, you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid?
Steve...

## What are you doing here?
I just came to get some stuff. I'll be out in five minutes. He doesn't want me around.

## Why deprive him of his greatest pleasure?
Ah, Jesus Christ, Danny, how can you wear that thing?... You know what it means? To your people...

## Is this because of those kids who used to beat you up?
What kids?...

## The Polacks? From Sacred Heart?
Nobody ever beat me up. Look, Linda, there're fifty reasons. Even if you knew them all, there'd be another fifty you didn't know.

## Hello...?
Daniel Balint? My name's Guy Danielsen. I'm a reporter with the New York Times.

## Who knows what that is?
A Jewish prayer.

## Which was his room?
Number ten.

## Where's Mrs. Moebius?
Her place is down the road. But she just comes out for weekends sometimes.

## Which one were you aiming at?
The mother.

## What is it?
Green dot -- shotgun powder. For pipe bombs. A guy in a lumberyard gave it to me. A donation to the cause.

## What...?
Open it up.

## That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
I'm sorry, Danny. It won't happen again. I'm going to use a brand-new power cell. Plus we'll have a back-up timer.

## What about Drake, did he ever show up?
No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows where he went.

## Didn't you get anything?
I'm not hungry.... Come on, let's drive around.... We don't want to be spotted here.

## Oh, what is this shit?
Keep driving. Don't slow down.

## Who even knew?
Mrs. Moebius.

## Why? Why would she?
The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.

## So what do we do with the device?
Take a right on 59th... We'll put it someplace else.

## Where?
I have an idea....

## When do you want it to go off?
Seven-thirty tomorrow evening.

## Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...

## JTS...?
What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.

## Are you an artist?
No, no... Not that kind of... underground. More a private... business. Private.

## Why me?
You want to kill a Jew. I already did.

## Who'd you kill?
Four. But no one this important.

## How did you know they were Jews?
I can tell....

## How?
You can't say that....

## Exactly.
Do I give a shit?

## Who's this?
Dennis Leary.

## Leary?
No.

## Funny?
Not like Mr. Dorfmann.

## Just a little... What's the difference?
We want you to help run it. Give speeches, lead seminars... Handle the fund-raising.

## Fund-raising?
We think you'd be good at it.

## Look, if you want to kill Jews on your free time, fine. We need you to raise money. Will you do that for us?
Beth Shalom? It's Reform.

## So what?
They're not that Jewish.

## I don't care what they are. I know those people, and I don't like them. The rest are just a bunch of kikes, aren't they?
We tested the new bomb.

## What?
We redesigned the timing mechanism. It can't possibly malfunction.

## None whatsoever. But I have to admit, I'm not terribly surprised.
Danny, please. Just give your speech.... And nothing about Jews, okay?

## In the Third Reich, weren't a number of high-ranking Nazis of Jewish origin?
Yes.

## Does he know?
No.

## And you...? Do you love Enzo?
Very much, I think. But, there's going to be a problem.

## You're leaving?
Yes... Could you please give this to Enzo.

## Did you tell him?
Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.

## Sorry. Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little. What did you say?
I said that the file is incomplete.

## Did the driver really freeze?
The documents are forged.

## I thought it was Spanish that you spoke?
Italian is practically the same thing.

## The Italian, I presume?
Yes.

## Where did you two meet?
In a lake.

## A new world record! That's great! It gives me something to beat tomorrow! You ever been to Tahiti?
He looks strange, doesn't he? Like a baby that just learned to walk.

## Have you known him long?
Forever. We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.

## What was he like, when he was little?
No.

## Tonight we're having a little party among ourselves. 8 o'clock in my suite?
Okay.

## ... It's easy. You go down. You come up. ... Right, Johana?
Congratulations, Enzo.

## Don't you agree, Jacques?
And the lights! Running lights, stealing stretchers...! You'll have us in jail.

## Enzo, stop bitching, will you?
Well, good night, then...

## You going to sleep here, all by yourself?
Yes...

## Okay, now we have a good five minutes to have a nice peaceful talk.
Is it a poem?

## What are you doing here?
Checking out the competition.

## What else is there?
You know what I'm talking about.

## A little... You think it's the same for Jacques?
No. Jacques is a creature of the sea. He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.

## You told Bonita, but you didn't tell him, right?
... Not yet.

## Why?
Ten thousand.

## Lira?
Dollars.

## You're going to hold me up at a time like this?
In my village, we have a saying, when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction.

## Roberto? How long?
Six seconds.

## Enzo, what are you going to do with the money?
Have the car painted.

## Yes?
Find the Frenchman. Find me Mayol.

## The medics are looking all over for you.
What about the shoes?

## Where did you get that?
\"That\"! This is not a \"that\"...

## Is he here?
He's training.

## Plenty of women everywhere right?
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.

## ... What's your name again?
Noireuter.

## What's with the voice?
It's nothing. It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.

## Try speaking to me?
Is that alcohol? Are you out of your mind? Alcohol is strictly forbidden.

## You don't mind if I go instead, do you?
No...

## Jacques, my friend, how are you?
Enzo...

## That's good. You never would have recognized me, huh? Check out the suit! Looking good, no? You know I'm the world champion?
Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.

## ... So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask. Am I right?
Yes, of course. Lots of questions.

## Well, what are they?
I'm sorry... I don't know how to ask the questions.

## How do you make a living? Your experiments, does it pay well?
It's okay.

## ... You married?
No.

## Damn right! That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
So, not married. Well, good for you. You play the field, like me. A girl in every port, huh?

## People say that?
... For the mermaids.

## No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?
... Everything.

## Everything about what?
Well... about everything.

## Why?
Because pasta should be eaten \"Al Dente\". So the trinket will just have to wait a bit.

## Hey! Will you slow down! When did you learn how to drive?
Driving isn't the problem, it's remembering the right road.

## What?
The dolphins aren't the only ones who don't feel very good sometimes.

## You still collect them?
Yes.

## You don't have that one, do you?
No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep.

## You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
... Yes.

## Enzo, don't be angry. I was lucky... that's all.
It's never the sea! It's Roberto, Mamma, that stupid actress... Oh shit! Jacques, what do you know?

## Long enough to die. Listen, if you really want to die, that's your problem, but don't do it under my nose, okay?
I'm concentrating.

## ... I was right about what?
... It is much better down there. It's a better place.

## A drink to warm up?
Yes, thank you. Intravenous if possible.

## We saw each other a little while ago.
Tea... or whiskey?

## In the lake?
No... in the hut.

## But what brought you to Sicily?
I'm being a pain in the ass. It's beautiful here.

## I don't know... why?
Just because... I would have liked to visit the town... See the coast... I don't know anybody... Expect for you.

## I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?
I thought you'd be at the dinner.

## You jumped in?
Only to help the medics, I assure you.

## No. I want to show you. Is it ruined?
Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...

## How can you tell it's a female?
... The way she moves.

## How do you know that?
I don't know, I just feel it.

## Jacques, you set a world record.
Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?

## I did?
Aren't you happy? Don't you feel proud...? I feel proud and all I did was watch.

## Why?
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.

## Hello?
It's me... Johana.

## How are you?
I got fired.

## So have I. ... Hello?
I'm still here.

## Do you know how it is? Do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid?
No... tell me.

## Hello?
It's me again.

## I'm being a pain, huh?
... Not at all.

## You sure?
Absolutely positive.

## Uncle Louis. He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
I'm very pleased to meet you, Uncle Louis.

## And you?
I didn't dive.

## You'll try again tomorrow?
I don't know... it didn't feel right. I'm going to bed. I'm tired.

## What?
... Nothing.

## What are you doing?
I'm putting you on the coin... Your essence... That way you'll always be with me when I dive.

## Jacques...?
You go back, I'll walk.

## What's wrong?
It's nothing. Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.

## ... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like?
... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.

## Why?
Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one.

## You've got to tell me what happened?
I saw how it has to be.

## ... Are you sure?
Positive, Sir.

## This is the hotel San Domenico?
Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.

## Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.

## Hey! Have you ever seen a mermaid?
No.

## Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.
Why don't you ask me?

## Did you buy the cassettes? The Wagner, the Berlioz?
I brought Johana to meet you.

## Where are you from, Henrietta?
Johana... New York.

## What kind of name is that? To be named after a city?
Well... here.

## In my apartment?
You're back! Hello. We were burgled.

## Again?
They got the new T.V.

## You called the police?
They're going to send detectives.

## How was your trip?
Nice... Very interesting... Great! ... I guess.

## Okay... Who'd you meet?
It's his heartbeat.

## Haven't you been listening?
... Since eight o'clock last night...! You're in love.

## Does that have a hidden meaning?
No. I'm just depressed.

## What are they for?
They're paramedics. They wait at 180 feet.

## If there was a problem, they could do something right?
Of course, that's what they're for.

## But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
Yes... It's magic.

## Who... Who is that?
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.

## That's the experiment? Dumping a guy into a frozen lake?
... The truck fell into a very deep crevasse. We weren't able to save the equipment.

## But... how is he going to breathe?
He isn't going to breathe.

## How long can he stay down? Without breathing?
It depends. He should come up soon. Unless he's decided to stay for the night.

## Why is he doing this?
For one thing, it's his job... as for the rest of it, I wish I knew.

## Shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something?
Coffee might be nice.

## Will he understand Spanish?
His mother's an American. He spent half of his life in the states. I'd try English if I were you.

## Okay, okay. You'll have it by the end of the week, how's that?
You've made me a happy insurance person.

## ... Yes?
I'll go see how he's doing.

## What's your first move?
I'm gonna pay a visit to the K.L.F. See if they've got the 411 on Santa's location. I'll check in with you when I know more.

## You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen?
That'll work. Get them out to the Jewish community stat. We got an epidemic on our hands.

## What's up?
About an hour ago, we received this transmission from the North Pole.

## So why the long face?
It's Esther. Santa's got her.

## Please. Will you help me?
There won't be any need for that sir.

## So. Do you have a name?
It's Esther.

## You like my Mordechai, yes?
He's...he's very nice. But Mrs. Carver, the fate of Hanukkah rests solely in his hands. Please, you have to help me.

## What do you want me to do?
Well, I couldn't be happier for the both of you.

## Mr. Jefferson Carver?
Please, call me Mordechai.

## Client notes. Sorry. What can I do for you?
My name is Esther. Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal from the Jewish Defense League desperately needs to speak with you.

## How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?
Actually, his days of marital infidelity have long since past. Now he just shtoops my mother exclusively.

## Any sign of Santa?
What are we going to do? We're at least an hour from the front.

## So, now what?
Now we wait for Santa to make his next move.

## Want to get a drink?
Sure. Why not.

## You mean like disco dancing or doing the funky chicke...Oh. I get it.
What was that!?

## Mordechai?
Yes Esther.

## When did you guys have this conversation? When I was in the bathroom? What else did she have to say?
Oh my god. She's become my pimp. And she's whoring her bitch-son out to the highest bidder.

## What are you doing here?
We go to the same temple.

## Mordechai. Do you love your mother?
Mom, stop with this already. Of course I love you. You're my mother.

## Mom, why don't you put that cat out of its misery?
...and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the Jewish community.

## Okay, what's the information?
She said to remind you that you're having Shabat dinner by her tomorrow and also to remind you to bring the Manischewitz.

## Anything else?
Yeah, I'm going to be out of the office from 1,30 to 3,00 on Sunday. I have a terrible yeast infection and I need to see my gynecologist.

## I'm back on the job for the JDL. You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa?
Oh, most definitely. Got the brothers here in full alert mode.

## Actually, I...I don't. What does that mean?
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.

## Not if I can help it. You got any information for me?
Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is.

## What's wrong with him?
He's still working out some identity issues.

## Cool. What's it do?
Man, that's far out! Hey, the Jets won!

## Porno? You're tellin' me that you can get porno on that thing?
Oh yeah. Take a look.

## What are you doing?
Just praying to god that we don't kill ourselves going over this wall.

## A stereo type alarm system?
Take a look.

## How do we bypass it?
Listen cat, I'll have you know that I hate the taste of watermelon and am a terrible basketball player.

## What are you doing?
Offscreen gunfire. That Jewish Atomic Clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget.

## Hammer, you alright?
Everything's kosher. Watch him for me.

## Excuse me? Do I know you, friend? Take a look around you. Do you even know who I am?
Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah.

## Hey everybody. How's it hangin'?
In fact, he's just informed me that he personally plans on cancelling Christmas this year.

## I don't have to tell you anything Hammer! You're gonna have to kill me before I tell you!
Hah! Jewish guilt. Well, it won't work on me Hammer. I'm too strong for it.

## What should I charge?
Oh, that's the beauty of it. These are free samples.

## So what's in the boxes? Heroin? Cocaine?
Worse.

## So, how was I?
It was good. Very chilling, but you still got all the points across that we talked about.

## I wasn't too over the top?
No, it was the perfect level.

## No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?
I don't know. Why don't you ask them sir.

## What's going on? Why'd he stop?
Maybe he ran out of ammo.

## What day is it?
It's Friday.

## That depends. How much money has he?
When you marry champagne, Clo-Clo, you can't trade it in for beer. You're stuck with it.

## I can't understand that fancy talk. You mean I'm a gold-digger? Sure, I'm a gold-digger -- why not?
Nobody. A boy who works in a grocery.

## Good looking?
Mmmyes.

## What about me?
You get your money from your husband.

## Well, Charlie, just why do you think your cat didn't kill the Contreras girl?
You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.

## Oh, I'm only exploring your theory. Let's take a step further. You drink, don't you, Charlie?
I drink.

## Then what do you do?
I sleep it off.

## But between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours, what happens, Charlie?
I don't know.

## You really think so, Charlie?
They all say the cat killed this second girl.

## I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
Sure.

## Where's that man?
Up at the museum.

## What do you want to see him for?
I want him to lock me up.

## What did they say before the bad card came up?
The elderly man I told you about.

## When you are going to see Pedro, does your heart beat until you tremble?
Love is different for different people.

## Well, now that you've had your history lesson, I think I'll get on to the museum.
You think be's pretty nice, don't you?

## Show business?
Well, I'd best be off.

## You're worrying about its killing someone else?
Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody.

## You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?
No. I'm quite sure.

## Why?
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.

## You know Charlie How-Come?
We're old friends.

## Come to look around?
More or less.

## About Charlie's leopard?
Yes.

## You, Charlie -- you know leopards. You might have had an old claw around somewhere, and perhaps a bit of hair from the cage - eh?
Come on, Charlie. Let's go find another and better suspect.

## Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?
Some other time.

## You know a lot. You've taken a lot of fancy courses in colleges and that kind of stuff - - what kind of a man would kill like that?
But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.

## I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
He'd act normally when he was with other people. It would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.

## I didn't do anything. She screamed. Something frightened her.
You've thought of all this before. You know it isn't the leopard  Don't you?

## Why did you give up teaching?
Nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time.

## Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
No. He was kidding Charlie.

## State hunters?
Professional hunters, who rid the state of cougars.

## Chief, don't you understand what this means?
You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.

## That's a fact, isn't it?
Yes. And I am taking it to headquarters for examination.

## You won't go to Galbraith with me?
Get it out of here!

## Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?
No - not yet.

## Almost three years, isn't it? And have I ever done anything to hurt you?
No  not yet.

## Clo-Clo?
I thought you might strut this kitten in right in the middle of her act.

## Are you all right?
I don't know  a witness. He seemed to know something about animals -- you know -- expert testimony.

## Yeah.
What did he have to do - look at the body?

## Forget it. I'm buying a drink for a fellow who was on the posse with me, a nice guy. Come along he'll get a great kick out of meeting you.
And did you find the leopard?

## Who is he?
You remember the fellow this morning -- Galbraith. You've got time before the supper show.

## And not a sign of the leopard?
I can use them.

## Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?
That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.

## And she waited here for him?
Robles says it looks that way. Belmonte had already been there and left. They only missed each other by a few minutes.

## What else do you care about, Kicks?
You. Us.

## You're positive of that, aren't you?
I got into a little crap game.

## How do you know?
It's all right. I'm not hurt.

## All those soldiers out there... getting bored, thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps?
Aint nobody out there, Mister.

## Nobody? Huh!... How come?
Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...

## You a tourist?
Thats right.

## Will you please come with me?
That might depend on where youre going.

## Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
Im afraid they are out at the moment, sir.

## When will they be back?
Mr De Moraes is due back from Brazil late this evening. Mrs De Moraes is out and not expected before eight. Do you wish...

## By the way, Laurence, were you here last time your mistresss brother came over? You know, just before he disappeared?
I work here, sir. Im here most of the time.

## You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir. Would you like a drink while you wait?
No. Thank you. Ill be fine...

## What about you, Mrs De Moraes?
I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.

## Was it cash, Mr De Moraes? The 1,000. You gave it to him in cash?
Im afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brothers in trouble.

## Can it be that you want your brother found?
Anything is possible.

## You... You found that at Leons?
Theres more. Your brother also purchased a young boy for 15,000.

## I need the money to smooth my way, you understand? Now, have you got that sort of cash here or do we need to meet in the morning?
I will of course do my best to hang onto it.

## Where is it? He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
I cant tell you that yet. But hes being well looked after.

## How dare you... You dont know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard?
The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.

## Excuse me?
Get out of my house. Youre fired, Mr Lombard.

## Couldnt Nazi hunters do the job?
You drive a hard bargain.

## Thank you for coming. Come in and close the door, will you?
Last night you upset my sleep. Tonight my social life. We have two minutes. My dinner guests are waiting.

## You lost my money?
You could say that. And Friedman left this morning for Los Angeles.

## Who is Friedman?
The man who sold the boy to your brother.

## W-why are you telling me all this, Mr Lombard?
You drive a hard bargain, Mr Lombard.

## Have you got a pen?
Just a moment... Go ahead.

## Paul Lamont...?
Yeah. Goodnight, Mrs De Moraes.

## Why dont you ask when I left the Mondrian?
Im really sorry you were not called...

## Arent you curious to know about Friedman?
Black suits you.

## Or is it the other way round? The children are needed because you cant satisfy him?
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...

## You what, Mrs De Moraes? YOU WHAT?
Youre mad...

## I guess the news youd sent me after Friedman didnt go down too well, eh?
Whatever the reason, Im sorry I did. Goodbye, Mr Lombard. I believe you know your way out.

## You knew he had nothing to do with your brothers disappearance, didnt you?
Huh! Dont you recall convincing me he had? You should learn to live with your mistakes, Mr Lombard. There is some merit in it.

## What do you mean, No, Mrs De Moraes?
My brother hung himself.

## If-if my car is there, I could be the one who... Why dont you accuse me of killing my brother?
Leon could still have hung himself.

## One just doesnt... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
Think what you like. But dont presume to understand.

## Why do I feel I neednt answer that?
Rich. Young. Beautiful. You must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids.

## Five years of it. Surely, youd have divorced him if he disgusted you?
You splendid bastard...

## Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
...Were turning in circles.

## What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child suppliers being tailed?
Something like that.

## Something like that?
Something like that.

## What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice?
Here we go again.

## Where is that?
Simplify and damn.

## Should I?
You seem to know what youre talking about.

## To get me killed...?
No. Not us...

## What do you suggest?
I dont know. Everyones dead...

## Why the hell couldnt you divorce the man?
You wouldnt understand.

## OPERATOR Directory enquiries. Can I help you?
Yes. Im trying to reach a friend but I cant get through. The number is 01766 770 471.

## A call box? Thats odd. Where exactly?
OPERATOR Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.

## Good morning, sir. How can I help you?
A coffee and a couple of croissants.

## Crow what?
Croissants.

## Im sorry, sir. Could you try that again?
Croissants. Like that...

## May I ask where youre from, Mr Lamont?
Europe... France. Im French but I live in London... ... England.

## You wouldnt have a cigarette, would you?
I dont smoke. If you could get to the point...

## Youre sure you wont sit down, Miss Stewart?
Im fine standing, thank you.

## Is this some kind of sick stunt? Let me guess. You want money, right?
A small loan would be welcome. More urgently, I need access to a telephone and an address where things can be sent to me.

## Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why cant you go back there?
The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.

## By your Austrian?
Yeah.

## You dont know why hes come to Los Angeles? The man you say he killed? Who was he? A colleague of his?
No. A poor little rich boy who thought hed save a few kids from their retailer. He disappeared on his second shopping expedition.

## You know where to look for your Austrian, right?
I know where to look.

## No answer. You have no passport and your Embassys out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?
Im sure Ill find a way.

## Thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what were doing here?
Did you call me up here to enjoy yourself, Emily, or to let me use your phone? Because we seem to have a slight problem...

## Did you not enter this country illegally?
Huh... I have no... ... hard evidence...

## What...?
Friedmans dead... They killed him...

## So who... Whos the man? Where is he?
Some Italian I picked up back there. Hes in the boot of the Mustang.

## Italian? The Mafia...?
Who knows. Who cares... You wanted slime. You got slime.

## Do you know a friendly cop?
That-that wont do. Thats not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, thats the way...

## Its up to you whether they walk or not.
Damn it! You cant fucking walk away from this!

## What about your friendly cop?
Theyd never let me go. And youd end up in more trouble than you know for helping me.

## I can... The question is, can you lie to your ex- husband?
Nothing sticks to slime, Emily. This should cover what you lent me.

## And losing you, wed lose him. And that would be a shame, dont you agree?
Hi...

## Emily...
Thats right. Wheres the fucking Italian, eh, Mr French hero?

## Im calling about the puppies.
Shit! Fuck! Whats fucking wrong with people! Im going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to!

## Have we done business before?
I saw the ad at Georges. Im passing through town and Im in a hurry.

## Why?
This is a bad line.

## Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months. Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand?
Yeah.

## We also provide 24-hour after-sale service. Were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die, we would unburden you, you understand?
Yes... Good, good...

## So, what are you looking for?
What about an untrained pup, white...

## I see. How much?
I dont know. Hes gone! Hes gone. I dont fucking know where, I swear... Hes gone. On holiday...

## ...On holiday?
Yeah... This morning. He left this fucking bloody morning... Jesus, man, my knees...

## Whos the money man?
Who? Martin... Hes Martin...

## Ever seen him before?
No... No... I swear...

## Whats this place? A hotel of some kind?
Yeah... The Diplomat.

## Where are we?
Finsbury Park. Were in Finsbury Park.

## And who does Friedman work for?
The company. We all work for the company.

## What company?
I dont know. I dont know, man. I dont even know Friedman that well... I... Man, youve got to get me out of here...

## How many of you scumbags are here?
Just me... Martins gone back to the Ambassador. Look...

## Whats the Ambassador?
Another hotel. Down the road. Martin lives there. He took your money. Hes got a safe... I need a doctor...

## What about the staff? Theyre in on whats going on, arent they? How many of them?
F-five. The Wilsons and their three kids. They run the place. Look, man, Ive got to get to...

## What colour is your car? What colour is your car?
B-Black...

## Where is it?
Downstairs... At the front... Jesus...

## Im sorry but Mr Gluck is not answering, sir. Would you like to leave a message?
Ill call again.

## The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I help you?
Can I have the reception desk, please.

## Does Mr Gluck call for his messages?
Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning, sir.

## You sure you passed on my message?
I certainly did, sir...

## Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?
No.

## I dont know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many.

## Its Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend?
Oh... We split up.

## Jane, there was an envelope in my desk. The one Id given you and then got back, remember? I cant find it. Do you know where it is?
Its not.

## Id appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you cant, dont worry about it. Ill call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but Im in a hurry.
Just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past. Say youre my secretary, all right?

## What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean, not this but... Money, passports, a gun in a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who are you?
Hello, Jane. Its me.

## Carlos De Moraes?
Yes. How did...

## Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it?
I hope its not too significant.

## What if it is?
Whatever, you come recommended. We...

## Didnt you say I came recommended? Thats what I thought. May I know by whom?
You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.

## Do what, Mr Lombard?
Check with your sons bank. Banks dont usually give out information about their customers.

## Did you look for his passport, driving licence?
Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.

## I take it your son is not married, Mrs Spitz?
No. And before you ask, no, hes not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious...

## Im sure... As far as you know, when and where was your son last seen?
When... Im told he came here...

## Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
Ha... No, Mr Lombard. His monthly allowance is all he is to expect from us. He knows it and we feel the amount is more than adequate.

## 10,000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy?
Plus a trust fund to provide for the boys education.

## What happens now?
We conclude our transaction.

## Is my money in there?
Uh-huh. You couldve waited for me inside.

## Am I supposed to know him?
Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours.

## No. In Hampstead... Why?
Maybe the thought of people like you going on holiday bothers me. Come on, lets go...

## Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.

## Who are you? Who are you working for, huh?
Youre making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guys not one of Friedmans...

## What is?
Dying without ever reaching the top...

## Trying to say something, Martin?
Hyatt... Friedmans... at the Hyatt...

## The Hyatt...? Whats that?
Ho-hotel... Los Angeles... He...

## Its about the puppy. You got the money?
Yeah.

## At what time will you be available?
Three oclock.

## What are you talking about?
We need a double-room and as I understand youre here alone wed be much obliged if youd agree to move to a single room...

## Have you?
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.

## An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?
Will you be alone? The merchandise. Is it just you or...

## No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?
Leon? No. Im afraid he left.

## Wheres your wallet? Have you got a wallet?
Is this some kind of mugging? Because...

## Shut up! Wheres your wallet?
As you know from speaking to Phil, your friend Leon has disappeared, Rhian. His family have hired me to find him.

## Did Leon tell you why he didnt want the police involved, Rhian?
He just said he had good reasons.

## Good reasons?
His mother would be pleased to hear that.

## Who else knows about the boy?
My sister... She lives in the next valley.

## I cant think of a good reason for it - for now anyway. My number if anything happens. Whats your sisters number?
Oh, I... She just moved. Ive got her new... Its in my book in the kitchen. Wait... Thank you.

## Ive been away. Did Leon speak to you about his sister?
Er... Yes...

## The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash?
Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...

## Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?
... No.

## You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
He showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street...

## Hows the boy doing?
Fine...

## I... How long have I been here?
Three days and thats three days too many.Come on. Get your ass up.

## Los Angeles?
Los Angeles is 100 miles away.

## Excuse me?
Uh-huh.

## Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge. You dont know Leon, do you?
I know his work better than I know him.

## What about which girlfriend?
Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.

## Yeah. Why? Youre going to look for her... Shit! You really think his pictures are that good?
Fucked-up fucking weird.

## Quest-ce que tu veux?
Un Autrichien. Negociant en pr- pubescents.

## O est pass ton salon?
Mon bureau cotait trop cher.

## Then why dont you reach him?
I dont have your credentials, Nathalie.

## Okay, shitbag. Im only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?
Who? I dont know who the fuck youre talking about, sunshine.

## Huh! You turned him into a liability, didnt you know?
If he had, youd be dead.

## What do you think, huh?
I think youd rather not know what I think.

## Thats the beauty. An anonymous call. Makes you wonder how many people know what youre up to, eh, French-fuck?
Try again, and this time be polite.

## What sums?
Two stiffs and a missing kid followed your visit to one of the London hotels. He didnt need your confession...

## Youre sure he said his caller was a man?
Thats what he said...

## What you gonna do? Kill me?
Dont tempt me. The last scumbag who thought I might kill him died soon afterwards.

## Huh. Im a businessman. What are you, eh?
Moreau? Cest moi. Alors...

## Mossad?
Its a good guess...

## DAIS Very funny. Can I go on now?
ITALIAN ACCENT Sure. But speak English, will ya, ha ha...

## What do you mean?
My lord, I'm not sure that...

## Why, are you not ready to die for your king?
Of course I am, it's just that...

## Very generous of you all. How much?
10,000 gold crowns.

## What do you fear most now... my sword? ... or his hands?
Tremoille... don't. Please...

## Do you think I could have some water?
I would like some fresh straw.

## Now?
Yes. I didn't confess today.

## Now?
Better today than tomorrow.

## Yes, I am. I'm an archer who can read and write. Who do you want to write to?
Uh... they said... they will think about it.

## The king said you're his finest archer...?
Well...

## Jeanne, calm down, do you hear me? Are you alright?
Yes...

## Yes. Yes, I'm fine... We need more brushwood! Why are you staring at me like that?
Because there's an arrow in your leg.

## So... what am I supposed to do now?
They've abandoned me... like everyone.

## What... what do you mean?
It's been weeks since they spoke to me. Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...

## Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?
It's not time yet. My mission is not over yet. There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.

## But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
I don't know it. I feel it.

## That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?
You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart.

## What did the king say?
He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...

## Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?
To marry you.

## But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
But it is what I want.

## Will you at least let me stay with you?
It would not be the same without you.

## Did God forbid you to tell the truth?
No. But my revelations were for the King of France, not for you.

## Is it true that you launched an attack on Paris?
I tried to.

## It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?
I don't remember. Maybe.

## Do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day?
I don't know...

## And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?
No... I said \"Surrender in the name of the King of France\"...

## Do you have a sword?
Quite a few.

## Didn't you also carry a banner?
Yes...

## Which did you prefer, your banner or your sword?
I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.

## And why was that? Did it have some particular value or power?
No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.

## And?
And so I... I prefer my banner.

## Why?
To avoid killing anyone.

## Are you saying that if you had not been carrying your banner you'd have killed more people?
No, of course not... I never killed anyone...

## Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?
We have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner...

## So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
Yes, but...

## Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?
No, I... I held it up to...

## You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
Yes, maybe... I don't remember...

## It is the sacred place that matters, Charles -- not the size. Am I correct, Bishop?
I don't understand... the holy oil of Clovis... it was quite full the last time I saw it...

## And when was that?
Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...

## Who's running this trial, you or her? I can't believe it! This wretched girl -- how dare she speak to us like that?
She's loyal to her king... it's only to be expected that she...

## Whose side are you on, Cauchon?
I'm on the side of our Mother Holy Church. Besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.

## Am I... am I dead?
Dead you're worthless, darling.

## Where... where am I?
Guess.

## Are you alright? Did they hurt you?
Quick -- hide in here...

## But where are you going to be?
I'll be right here... I promise.

## Who are you?
Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais. As you were captured in my diocese, the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me.

## Trial? What trial?
Your trial, Jeanne. On a charge of heresy.

## But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?
It seems that the English care more about you than the French.

## The English?
Yes. They paid your ransom... tomorrow you will be transferred to their great castle at Rouen.

## So... begin by telling us your name -- assuming you're allowed to tell us that much?
My name is Jeanne. My little cross I had round my neck was taken away from me. I would like to have it back.

## Show us a little more cooperation first. Where were you born?
In a village called Domremy.

## How old are you?
Nineteen... or thereabouts...

## Were you baptized?
Yes. In the church at Domremy.

## I assure you they do. So... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?
Not long ago...

## When exactly? A day, a week -- when?
Last night.

## What were you doing when the voice came?
Praying.

## The voice was in your cell?
Yes.

## What did it tell you?
Many things...

## Tell us, Jeanne... do you often hear this voice?
Yes...

## So it is the Church Militant that refuses to confess me, and so prevents me from being a good Christian?
It is for us to determine whether you are a good Christian, not you.

## I am sent by God, and I submit all my words and deeds to His judgment. Or do you think that you are better judges than He is?
No... I want to be confessed.

## I don't understand, Jeanne... why did you do it? Why?
And you? Why did you lie? You promised I could be confessed...

## Good day, sir. I trust my honorable Duke of Burgundy is feeling well?
He's feeling wonderful.

## I understand. How much?
20,000?! But... I heard King Charles was... financially embarrassed.

## You will?
For the sake of France, Charles. And for the sake of my grandson.

## ... and what... what did he say?
I don't need lodgings if we're to be marching on Orleans...

## Now hold on -- you're not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber!
Gave you? Well now, I wouldn't quite put it like that...

## So how would you put it?
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!

## I can see her if I want to. I mean, with half of France in the hands of the English, what have I got to lose?
Your majesty, I really think you...

## Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
Go and ask him yourself.

## You told us about the appearance of this... voice. What exactly did you see? Part of it... or all of it?
His face.

## Does he have hair?
Yes.

## Is it long and hanging down?
I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.

## May I, without offending you, inquire how generous?
20,000 gold crowns.

## Were you sent by Lord Dunois?
Yes... they were.

## Everywhere. Where is the food?
It's coming -- I rode on ahead. I have to speak with the Captain of the English army... his name's Talbot...

## Good. Can you bring me to him?
He's on the other side of the river.

## Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
For what?

## So... what is the message?
We offer the English a last chance to return home in peace. If they refuse, we recross the river and attack them here -- at the Tourelles.

## Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
Knowing what I know? Enormous gratitude.

## Well...? Shall we go?
Not yet.

## But... don't you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?
As long as she brings food and supplies, she'll be welcome.

## And... what does Jeanne think?
I don't think. I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.

## Clear?
Perfectly.

## You look disappointed... Isn't this what you wanted?
I care! And I care because God cares! All life is precious to God -- even his -- even yours and mine...

## Bravo! What about all the other hundreds of prisoners? Do we let them go too?
Maybe... I don't know... but first we have to confess...

## But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?
He never sent them... Don't you understand? He doesn't want this war anymore... he has his crown now, that's all he ever wanted...

## MAISTRE Who told you to wear men's clothes?
The clothes are not important...

## MAISTRE So you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?
I... submit to Our Lord.

## Tell us, Jeanne... why did you jump from the tower at Beaurevoir?
I had been sold to the English. I'd rather die than fall into their hands.

## Did your voice tell you to jump?
No...

## How can you deny it when you just said \"I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English\"...?
That's now what I meant...

## You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
Yes, but...

## Stop it! What are you doing?
Nothing... just taking his teeth.

## Sorry Jeanne... Did you both meet already?
Jeanne, let me introduce the king's half brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.

## Were the men confessed? Where are the priests?
I swear I'll never swear again in my life if you save her life! But I'm warning you, if you let her die, then you're the biggest...

## When you were taken prisoner at Compiegne, did you have a horse?
Yes... a half-steed... white.

## Who gave you that horse?
My king.

## How many did he give you?
Five steeds and a few hackneys...

## As much as for a Lord? What an honor! Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?
No.

## What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?
Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...

## Jeanne... what are you doing?
Playing...

## What have you done to me?
I -- I -- I...

## Who... who are you...?
I am that I am. You don't like my face? Maybe you prefer this one...

## Who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil? Are you God?
No... no... I'm just a messenger... He needs me... a higher calling...

## YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...

## I... don't know... what do you want from me?
Nothing. I'm here to set you free...

## What are you doing out here?
I might ask you the same question.

## I don't understand. What do you want from me?
I told you already... I'm here to set you free...

## Who?
My... visions...

## They won't come anyway.
They're going to come and visit you in here?

## Why would they?
Because! Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...

## Really?
\"Let all who love me follow me\"... Where does God get mentioned? Come on Jeanne, be honest. You fought for yourself, in your name.

## No, no, you did fine. I'd even say well done. Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
No, I do not think so. I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.

## Really?
I -- I cleaned up my room, look... and I said my prayers... all of them... and...

## What are you doing on the wall?
I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...

## What for?
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.

## Do you think this cross will protect you?
No, I...

## My voices... my voices... do you think they will ever come back?
I don't think so.

## Are you going to leave me too?
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.

## Are you sent by God?
There's nothing for me to do here anymore... I don't belong here I want to be with Him now...

## Do you think you are ready?
Yes I am.

## Are you willing to follow all His commandments?
Yes...

## ... to love your enemy as much as you love yourself?
No...

## You think you are ready now?
Yes, my lord.

## So... alright. What terrible sin have you committed since then that can't wait till tomorrow to be forgiven?
I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.

## Whose were they?
My father's.

## Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home?
Oh yes... very.

## And your mother -- everything's fine with her?
Oh yes, she's... wonderful.

## Good, good. And your sister... Catherine -- she's still your best friend?
Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.

## And what about your other friends... you don't like playing with them?
Oh yes, I play with them... lots...

## So... everything sounds... wonderful?
Yes, it is.

## Then... why are you here so often?
I feel safe here. And it's where I can talk to him.

## Him?
Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.

## Who is this \"he\"?
He never says his name.

## What... does he... look like?
Beautiful.

## He says... he says I must be good... and help everyone... and take care of myself. Do you think he's coming from the sky?
Perhaps... but wherever he comes from, I think you should listen to him, because it sounds like he's giving you very good advice.

## Why did she have to die?
Only God knows the answer to that.

## Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?
It's like this... I...we...all of them.

## Someone you know?
Yes.

## A beauty. Who is she?
A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.

## Who are you?
My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's sister. oh! You're bleeding.

## Really?
Yes! It was...it was unforgettable.

## How are you doing?
Fine, no, not really, they arrested my cousin, but Jurek says they'll let him out. This is disgraceful.

## How long have you been married?
Just over a year.

## And how's Yurek?
Dead.

## When's your baby due?
Christmas. This is not a good time to have children. But then...

## Will I still be able to play?
Let's find out.

## Doesn't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves? Where will we get them?
To tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.

## Calm down, what, what is it?
They're hunting people on the streets. They've picked up Henryk.

## What?
Funny time to say this.

## What?
wish I knew you better.

## Can you help us?
It costs.

## Who told you?
People I know. They said you're an important man.

## Who's recruiting?
Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see!

## What d'you mean, take the table away?
The Germans go into Jewish homes and they just take what they want, furniture, valuables, anything.

## What's this about?
Sit down, have tea, I'll start lunch when the girls get back.

## What's the matter with you all? Have you lost your sense of humour?
Boys, boys...

## We use what?
Of course they'll notice it. But look-- This is a good place for something.

## You sell anything?
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.

## Did you beg, did you grovel to that piece of shit, that cockroach?
I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.

## They were taking you away.
What did you pay him?

## It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?
You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.

## What's the matter? Are you sick?
Hungry.

## What's that mean, no employment certificate?
You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise...

## Otherwise what?
You'll be deported.

## Yes, so did the Germans.
What are you reading?

## Yes, but what good did it do?
Ah, here. Today's news from the other side.

## So, what's the news?
The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov.

## I thought you'd be off on tour, playing London, Paris, New York?
Not this week.

## You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek.

## Why didn't you come to me?
I didn't know you were in the certificate business.

## Please, don't insult us. Can you do something for him?
Jurek? Wladek Szpilman.

## Maybe, maybe not, but, Jurek, don't be offended, I didn't call to discuss my future career.
Wladek! How are you?

## Puppydog, what d'you mean, you forgot?
Since last night. I was pleased to see you.

## You made contact?
Be ready to leave in two days' time. Same place as last night.

## And what do you think you'll do while you're setting up a new line of defence? Wander round lugging your suitcases?
Pack, Wladek, there's no time.

## No, I don't think so?
Warsaw Radio. I was a technician. I saw you almost every day.

## CAPTAIN What the hell are you doing?
I was... I was trying to open this tin.

## CAPTAIN What's your work?
I am... I was a pianist.

## CAPTAIN Where are you hiding?
In the attic.

## What's all that gunfire?
CAPTAIN The Russians. On the other side of the river. All you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks.

## What's happening?
CAPTAIN We're getting out.

## Are the Russians here?
CAPTAIN Not yet.

## CAPTAIN I've got another one. Warmer. What will you do when it's all over?
I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.

## ... without a shred of manners.
To be deaf?

## Like it were a piano?
It's strange isn't it? I mean it's not a piano, it doesn't make any sound.

## No sound at all?
No, it was a table.

## Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra.
Baines is packing up?

## Which mountains are those dear?
The Alps.

## Don't answer, he low born. Jun look at him, mongrel. Your wife where she?
She lives her own life in New Jersey, America.

## What's he say?
Someone died here. It's tapu.

## They want more money. They are trying to make two days out of it?
No, no they know another track - to the side of this.

## Good, flatish land with reliable water, why? I don't have money. What are you about?
I'd like to make a swap.

## What for?
The piano.

## The piano on the beach? Ada's piano?
You'd have to organise it up here.

## Ada says you're doing well with the piano?
I'll have to come and hear you play. what do you play.

## No, words. You have never heard words?
No, not words.

## Spoken words?
No, but her words are in my head. I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words.

## What are they?
She says, throw the piano overboard.

## I have the key here, look, I'll have it mended...
What?

## What's in here then, lead?
It's my mother's piano.

## A piano?
Oh no, it can't come now.

## What on?
On your piano, that is the swap.

## What does she say?
She says it's her piano, and she won't have him touch it. He's an oaf, he can't read, he's ignorant.

## And when is the next lesson?
Tomorrow.

## What will I play?
Play a gig.

## You the owner here?
That's right.

## All right if I look around your lobby?
No, but you're welcome to a free beer before you go.

## Who told ya this guy was in here?
Nobody. I just know what kinda women he likes. I'm gonna check all the joyhouses till I find him.

## I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms?
Right through there. But I wouldn't go in there if I were you.

## What are ya gonna do, call the cops?
I don't have to. You'll be bustin' in on the Chief of Police just up the hall.

## What's the line on Visitation?
7 to 2. That ain't bad.

## Billie. You ready?
Yeh, go ahead.

## You wanted by the law or somethin'?
Naw, it's okay.

## You got a bag or somethin?
No.

## How 'bout a handkerchief?
Here.

## Jesus, what a bundle. Did you know he was that loaded?
Hell no, I just cut into him. I woulda settled for pawning one of them shoes.

## Twist! When did you get back in town?
Coupla days ago. I'm workin' a big one with Gondorff on the North Side.

## Twist, you know this guy?
No. Never saw him before. He's a dick, though.

## You're late. Where you been?
I had some appointments.

## How much did ya lose?
All of it.

## You think my play is bad?
I think it's the best...

## What?
I'm gettin' too slow for this racket. I done the best I'm gonna do. You hang on too long, you start embarrassin' yourself.

## What the hell you gonna do with yourself?
Aw, I got a brother down in K.C., runs a freight outlet. I can go halfsies with 'em! It ain't too exciting, but it's mostly legal.

## You'll take a cut of what I make, won't ya?
I'm out, Johnny.

## Then why ain't he dead?
They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all. They'll get him next time.

## You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
Hell yes. He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.

## Well, hell, you got the whole Chicago south side. How do ya expect the eight lousy spots I've got to compete with that?
They did 14 grand in Evanston, 16.5 is Gary, and 20 in Cicero. Looks like you're bringing up the rear, Granger.

## You the Duff that didn't come up with his end when Little Jeff was sent up?
Wasn't no problem a mine.

## He was a con man, wasn't he?
He was a tear-off rat. He got what he deserved. No sense helpin' pay his bills.

## Which way did he do, Eirie?
Straight north. He was gonna take it all and run.

## I don't look any good in clothes and I don't know how to drive. What else ya got to sell, Eirie?
Forget it.

## Doyle, can I see you a minute?
I'm busy, Floyd.

## Which one?
Mottola.

## You sure he didn't just pocket it?
No, we checked his story with a tipster. He was cleaned by two grifters on 47th.

## They workin' for anybody?
I don't know. Could be. We're runnin' that down now.

## What about the other one?
They're still looking for him.

## Who's got the contract?
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.

## They staked out the other guy's place last night, but he never showed. They figure maybe he skipped town. You wanna follow 'em up?
Yes sir.

## What do ya want the others to get?
Nothin'. They gotta be outa there early. I'm gonna bust that bastard in one play.

## What am I supposed to do? Call him for cheating better than me?
Looks all right. It's big enough and off the street.

## Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
All he's gotta do is read.

## I can talk, can't I?
Glad to meet ya, kid. You're a real horse's ass.

## He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?
You mean you blew it.

## You gonna stay for breakfast, or do you already know how to eat?
I picked something up on the way.

## Lonnegan after you, too?
I don't know. Haven't seen anybody.

## Gondorff, you gonna teach me the Big Con or not?
You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.

## You know anything about him?
Yeh, he croaked Luther. What else do I gotta know.

## Why?
Cause I don't know enough about killin' to kill him.

## Then you'll do it?
He's not as tough as he'd like to think.

## How'd ya do?
Well we got some workin' money anyway.

## Everything go all right?
Yeh, it was easy.

## What do ya mean?
You know, somebody tailin' ya. A torpedo or somethin'.

## How 'bout Lonnegan?
I gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to.

## And?
He threatened to kill me.

## Did he say he wouldn't?
No.

## Why didn't you tell me about Snyder before?
I thought I'd lost him.

## Well you found him again and we're gonna have to do somethin' about it. What else haven't ya been tellin' me?
Nothin'. I told ya everything there is.

## Then why'd ya move outa your room?
It was too noisy.

## You know how easy it'd be for one of Lonnegan's guys to nail you?
All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em.

## How many guys you conned in your life, Henry?
I better do some packin'. I'm gonna be a hot number again after tomorrow.

## Then why you doin' it?
Seems worthwhile, doesn't it? Maybe it's just for the cave-in on Lonnegan's face when we put in the sting.

## You wanta wait for your share?
Naw, I'd just blow it.

## Fancies himself a gambler, huh?
We'll use the wire. Never known a gambler who wouldn't like to beat the ponies.

## He's gonna hit ya with 20 grand, Eddie. How much cash we got?
Not enough to cover a bet that big.

## What's the problem?
He wants to put a half million on Syphon.

## Everybody'll sit still for somethin'. What did ya find out about the train, Eddie?
I'm not sure I know it.

## Yeh, I think so. I gave the kay- ducer a C-note. You find out the deck?
He usually plays with a Royal or a Cadenza. I got you one of each. He likes to cold deck low, 8's or 9's.

## How ya doin'?
Nothin' yet. I got a good one on the lead at Hialeah, but he's fadin'.

## What are the odds on Syphon?
A half mill on an eight to one shot. You're dumber than I thought, Lonnegan.

## Who are you?
Gondorff asked me to look after ya.

## Hi there, Snyder. Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight, eh? Somebody lose the dominoes?
You scored blood money today, Hooker. You need a friend.

## We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station. Have you made any purchases here today?
Yes, a ticket to Chicago.

## Then I'm afraid we'll have to impound your money until we're sure that it's all good. Can I see your wallet and your ticket, please?
But I got a train to make.

## But what about all these other people?
I'm sorry, really I am, but my train leaves in ten minutes.

## You done?
Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat loaf.

## Where's June today?
She don't work here no more. I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.

## Where you goin'?
I don't know. Depends what train I get on.

## What time you get off work here?
2,00 A.M.

## You doin' anything tonight?
Yeh, sleepin'.

## Look, I don't have time to fuck around. There's somebody out there I don't need to see. You got a fire escape or anything?
No.

## What the hell for?
Just do what I tell ya and everything'll be jake.

## What does this guy want?
He'd like to kill me.

## You sure it'll be one of these two?
No. They're just the only ones we know of.

## All right, when?
Tomorrow, after 4,00. Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya. And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.

## Your boss is quite a card player, Carver. How does he do it?
He cheats.

## What do you mean?
He hired a dame to take it from ya.

## Then why the rat?
Cause I'm tired of bein' his nigger. I want you to help me break him.

## What's the matter? You gotta get back to Shaw?
Naw, he picked up some jane in the bar. Can't see him till morning anyway.

## That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
Maybe a couple million.

## And you were gonna pay me back?
I am after this race.

## Well, what did I tell ya?
You're a lucky man, all right.

## You stayin' in or not?
I'm in.

## You got the 400 grand yet?
Not yet, but... Hey, there's only a grand here.

## What is this? That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?
If your system's as foolproof as you say, you'll get even more.

## What happened to your face?
Had a little fight with a raggle down on 13th. She got me with her ring.

## What happened?
I didn't get the bet down in time.

## How am I gonna do that?
I don't know, figure something out.

## You want a drink or something?
No.

## You've already done time twice, and judges don't like three time losers. You wanna sit in the can for forty years, startin' tonight?
I'll make parole.

## Will you wait until the chump is played?
Hell yes. We don't care about the mark. He deserves what he gets.

## All right, Riley. What the hell happened?
We missed him.

## Yeh, and what does Cole say about that?
I don't know. He took it hard.

## We'll take it. You manage the building at the end of the alley?
For fifteen years.

## I'll need a room over there that faces this way. How much a week?
Only rents by the month. Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.

## Do ya know him or don't ya?
Yeh, but I don't know where he is.

## Well we do. He's chummin' around with a Big C named Henry Gondorff. Ring any bells?
Sure. Every bunco man in the country knows Gondorff.

## Why don't you pick him up yourself?
Wouldn't that be too bad. You'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got.

## What the hell good is Hooker to ya?
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.

## Have the police got any idea where Wynant is?
No.

## What about this Rosebreen?
Sorry. Don't know a thing.

## What's your next step, Nick?
Right back to California. We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.

## He was?
Yes. He admitted it.

## Why not?
You know how they are... sex...

## Is that what it means?
Of course.

## What's the matter, darling ... not sweet enough?
It's all right.

## What could happen to him, darling? You mustn't worry.... What is it?
Just a minute...

## Any luck?
He's just around the corner.

## Why did that man want to kill him?
Said he stole his invention.

## What?
Nothing.

## How are you?
Another young man.

## Mind if I look around?
Help yourself. Oh, Tom, show this gentleman...

## What are you talking about?
You're high enough.

## How are you?.... Oh, I'm Mrs. Jorgensen now.... No, she isn't here. Is it about her father? Well, can I take the message?
Give it to me.

## What is it? Has he found him?
Do you know where he's living? Oh.... Well, at least I'm glad he's all right. Thank you for calling. Goodbye.

## What is it?
Nothing.

## He's all right. Isn't that enough?
No.

## That's gone long ago. I've got to see him. Where is he?
I won't have you hounding him any more for money.

## I didn't.
Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?

## Then what are you hiding?
It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.

## Is your father still in there?
He's waiting for you.

## Did he tell you where he was going?
He wouldn't say.

## Aren't you Nick Charles?
Yes.

## Not that scrawny little....?
Yes.

## was fascinated with you.... a real live detective.... You used to tell me the most wonderful stories. Were they true?
Probably not.

## Your father?
No. The lawyer -- I'm going to see him.

## We're at the Normandie for a couple of weeks. Why don't you drop around?
Yes.

## Where did you hit her?
Why... in the heart.

## Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?
She fell down.

## Did she make any sound? Didn't scream?
I don't know.

## Which way did she fall?
She... she fell over backwards.

## Where did you get this gun?
He's been dead for three months.

## Forgive me. How are you?
Take a good look at him, Dad. Now please try to remember him... 'cause he's going to be your son- in-law.

## What would your mother say to that?
This is my wedding.

## He can stay home. Please, Dad, won't you?
If you think it'll be all right.

## Where are you going?
It's a secret. I can't even tell you, my dear. I've got an important idea to work on.

## A new invention?
Yes. And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.

## It's a promise?
That's one thing I won't forget. Where's Macaulay? I ought to be starting.

## How's your brother?
He's all right.

## I'd like to see him. Why don't you bring him down?
You know how it is, Dad. He's sort of under Mother's thumb.

## He's a brave man.
Like all the rest of us. Has this fellow... ...has he seen the whole family?

## Poor Dad, does that still bother you?
Only in bad weather.

## Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
Yes.

## Do you mind if I come down and see it?
Not at all.

## What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?
He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.

## Did they find any clues... a gun or fingerprints or anything?
Not a thing.

## I hope you won't talk that way to the police when they come here.
Was there much blood?

## Well, I've got my alibi. I was at the Public Library. Where were you?
Yes. I might not have been shot.

## What's he want of you?
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.

## What's that to you?
Nothing.

## What'd he think it was to you?
Ask him. I don't know.

## Have you got a pistol permit?
No.

## This gun yours?
No.

## Who's is it?
I'll have to try to remember.

## You mean about that gun?
That ain't a gun any more. The firing pin's busted - the - Don't waste time talking about that.

## Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?
Man to man, I'm not.

## What about the suicide?
Oh, that's a phoney. The men didn't even have to go down.

## No proof?
Nothing yet to cinch it.

## What do you mean?
For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.

## I haven't got that far yet. But I don't think that everything points to Wynant. What about the alibis?
They're all O.K. Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.

## What about Jorgensen?
I'll check on that. I'm afraid this is kinder dull for you.

## What about this Nunheim?
Oh, he's all right. We know all about him. He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.

## Did you know he was hanging around Julia?
I think we're on the right track.

## Who're you calling?
I'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.

## Get anything?
She's ready to talk. It won't do any harm, though - to find out where he is.

## \"D.W.R.\" That case you worked on... the guy who threatened to kill Wynant... what what was his name?
Rosebreen.

## Could this be him?
I never saw him. I don't think anyone saw him.

## What're you doing here?
I'll take care of him.

## Are you kidding?
No.

## Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.

## You mean that body-----?
--was Wynant's.

## When was the last time you gave her money for Wynant?
Yesterday. I gave her a thousand dollars.

## Seen any signs of it, Bill?
I said he hadn't written me.

## Oh, then you did hear from him?
Well....

## Well, what?
He telephoned me today.

## When was that?
About three.

## Did you go?
Yes. But he didn't show up.

## Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
I didn't know they had a fight.

## You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
Why yes.

## Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?
No.

## Are you sure you didn't leave the room... that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
I don't think so. Of course I was terribly upset... I hardly knew what I was doing.

## What kind of clothes was he wearing?
A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.

## Do you think that Wynant did it?
Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop.

## What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
She drives me nuts. She's been ragging me all day.

## Want to take a poke at him?
I didn't mean you, Mister.

## Sit down! We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole. Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?
I can't remember offhand, Lieutenant. Maybe I was over at Charlie's shooting pool. Maybe I was here. She'd remember.

## What are you going to do?
Just what I said I'd do.

## Who's that man?
He's not anybody. Just a fellow I used to know.

## Don't worry. You won't see him again. What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
No. I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.

## What bonds?
The government bonds. The ones you took from the office safe.

## No one else had the combination of that safe. You took them. What did you do with them?
What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....

## Hello .... give me .... Well .... ?
I never had it.

## Yes?
Oh, hello. Come on in.

## Did you get my money?
I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.

## Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket?
No.

## Is Julia going with you?
No.

## But what if you need more money?
I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you. Goodbye.

## How are you?
Hello, Macaulay. Come in.

## Mimi? ... Oh, Dorothy's mother. Does she have to be up to something?
She usually is. Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er - er - --sleuthing for her.

## What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.

## No word at all?
He sends word through Julia Wolf when he wants money... I give it to her and she gives it to him.

## How are you?
I hate to bother you when you're laid up.

## What are the chances of getting you to do what he wants?
Slim.

## Hello.... oh, just a minute. Police department?
But it must have been Wynant. I should have known if it weren't his voice.

## Clyde Wynant's crazy... absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this. No wonder the police think he has something to do with it.
What about it, Tanner. Isn't that the truth?

## Well, don't you?
You're always teasing.

## Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York. Hire one of them.

## Dorothy! Is she here?
Yes...

## Where's Gilbert?
I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.

## You did... where?
Last night. He came to see me at my apartment.

## Oh, did he? What did he say?
Do you mind putting that gun away? My wife doesn't care, but I'm in a delicate condition.

## Why tell me?
That's all swell. Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.

## What's that?
This is your party.

## If you like 'em like that.
Morelli - You knew Julia. Was she gypping Wynant?

## You got types?
Only you, darling... lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.

## By the way, how is your father's side?
Much better, thanks.

## How many drinks have you had?
Six Martinis. You're not going to have anything on me.

## What hit me?
That last Martini.

## Who's that?
Santa Claus.

## I'd better order some food. That sounds like an interesting case. Wouldn't you like to take it?
I haven't the time. I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.

## What are you drinking?
Rye.

## Where did you get that?
She brought it in. Trying to make me believe she did it.

## What are you going to do with it?
She didn't tell me a thing.

## Nick! Nick! Are you asleep?
Yes.

## Can't you get to sleep?
No.

## She thinks you can. It wouldn't hurt you to find out if you could, would it?
Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.

## All right... shoot! I mean... what's on your mind?
It's all right. It just grazed me.

## Well, quick -- get into bed. Are you all right?
Sure -- I don't even feel it.

## Want a drink?
Yeah.

## Well, didn't you?
I never saw that before.

## Who gave it to you?
You did.

## Finished with these?
Yes. I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.

## Who's that?
Macaulay.

## Aren't you hot in that?
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty. The Kirbys.

## Is that another Christmas present?
Yes.

## Did I give it to you?
Yes.

## Philadelphia. Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
I don't know.

## What's the matter with you?
The mystery's all gone. And I wanted you to find out who did it.

## But Wynant --- ?
I don't believe he did it.

## Why don't you?
I'm going to take Asta for a walk.

## What are you going to do?
I've got hunch. I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.

## You mean, he might be hiding there?
I don't know... This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.

## Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
He was down in the shop.

## Yup. Don't you want something to eat?
But they all said it was Rosebreen's.

## What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
Several things. Hello, Fred. We're hungry again. Yeah, and lots of onions. Oh, and coffee.

## Well, don't they?
Sure.

## How long has he been dead?
Couple of months anyway.

## Wynant dead? Does Dorothy know?
No. Nobody but you.

## Why not?
I want to lie low till I get the whole dope. I don't want to go off half-cocked.

## I've got a lulu -- why?
I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.

## Who do you think did it?
Mimi...

## I can't wait any longer. Tell me, do you think one of them did it?
Yes.

## Is that true?
I don't know.

## Why are you saying it?
It's the only way it makes sense.

## Come on out, now. He won't hurt you. Back to your old tricks, eh, Tanner?
No, Mr. Charles.

## How did you get in here?
I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.

## You worked here?
Yes, sir. Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.

## Well, that's a hot one. You a bookkeeper! When were you ever a bookkeeper?
That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing. I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.

## Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?
Honest, Mr, Charles. I never touched that safe. Them bonds that were missing... Julia took them.

## I'm sorry. Tanner, don't you want some wine?
No... no.

## You his wife?
I wouldn't know. That time he caught me was a accident. I led with my right.

## Bonds, sir?
I'm fired.

## Who fired you?
You did.

## You speak English? DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!?
Y-yes.

## Where were you going?
Baghdad.

## What's in the other direction?
This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.

## Think we're going to do it? Think we're going to war?
Not up to us. Up to the Iraqis. All they have to do is get out of Kuwait.

## What's it say?
Help, I'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory.

## You're out of your minds, you know that? Both of you. You don't even know if there's anything out there. What the hell are you thinking?
Yeah! Welcome to beautiful Iraq. Land of enchantment and riches.

## What?
I'd settle for being alive. Really. Alive would be fine.

## What are we going to do!?
We're going to keep driving.

## What kind of mine?
I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.

## We've got rope?
For climbing.

## Ready?
Yeah.

## What do you figure it to be?
Got to be some kind of landmark; something distinctive.

## What am I supposed to do?
Got to have someone here in case we need help making it back up. Doesn't hurt to have a look out either.

## It'll be too dark to make our way back now. Let's bed down for the night and head out at first light.
You ready?

## What about it?
I told you. He tried to steal our gold. He tried to kill us.

## What if I do?
No navicom. A lot of good you are now, Epps.

## Suppose I don't go for that?
Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you. I suppose.

## What about Jaeger?
Thanks for taking care of this for me.

## You don't know John Epps very well, do you?
Just keep quiet.

## So you can give us away?
Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps? Like I said; I expected more from you.

## It's like I said; you don't really know lieutenant John Epps very well, do you?
At-at-at-at-at. At-at-at-at-at.

## Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
What are you doing?

## Ready for what? What are you supposed to be doing?
I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.

## Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
I did it! I got the box open.

## You think?
They finally start the ground war, and where are we? Same place we've been since we got here. Securing freedom for the dirt.

## Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer?
Christ! Wes, tell him. You know this stuff.

## Cool it, Jaeger. Hey, Wes? Wes?
But that's the great thing about Gold. A little goes a long way.

## You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold?
Third. What you're going to do with your third.

## What are you going to do with your third?
Yeah. Yeah, she's fine.

## What?
I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing. I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.

## And you missed this? How are you going to miss something like this?
I didn't miss it. I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back.

## What do we do with the Humvee?
We leave it.

## What!?
Mine.

## Just be cool.
What?

## It's a mine, isn't it?
Just relax.

## How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
We're going to get off, all right. We'll get you off of there. Just...be cool.

## Where you going?
Me and Wes are just going to talk.

## Why you got to move away to talk!?
We're going to be right over here.

## How's this going to work?
Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.

## You're not losing trust, are you?
Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang on to it.

## I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing. We're in this together, understand?
Yeah, I understand. Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find. That's a sweet deal.

## What are they doing here?
Well, it's Iraq. I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.

## What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?
They're doing more than slapping.

## Where is it? Where'd it go?
Stay low.

## Where the hell is it!?
Just stay down.

## What are we going to do? What the hell are we going to do?
We're not going to do anything.

## Think there might be more Iraqis?
Right now I wouldn't be surprised if Eartha Kitt showed up singing Send In The Clowns.

## What does it look like I'm doing?
It looks like you're not doing anything.

## Is it dead?
Yeah, Bwana, you got it.

## We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
He's not going to leave us.

## Why do I have to stay down here?
Jesus, Jaeger.

## What are we going to do? How are we going to find our way back!?
We'll find our way.

## How!?
No.

## First Wes, now you?
I'm not like Wes. Wes was crazy.

## Is it all right if I stand up?
I'm glad I didn't have to kill you. I'm glad it didn't come to that.

## You still got a map on you?
What? Yeah.

## Epps?
Yeah.

## Wonder how the war's going?
It's got to be going better than this..

## You sure you want me too?
I pick that way.

## What do you figure it is?
Place all alone like that? Must be a boarder check point.

## Which boarder? Saudi? Kuwait? Syria?
Couldn't be Syria. We couldn't have gone that far north. It's got to be Saudi. Come on.

## Well?
Well, we should identify ourselves.

## They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them. They couldn't tell in the dark.
What did you say?

## What are we going to do?
Slip out your M-16.

## And then what?
I don't know. He didn't have a uniform on. He...he had on white robes, like the guys who killed Wes.

## To where?
Sun rises in the East. We go the opposite direction. May not find anything, but at least we'll know we're heading towards Saudi Arabia.

## What do we do?
We keep going, that's what we do. We ignore them, maybe they ignore us.

## What do you make of them?
Shi'ites, I think.

## Is that good, or bad?
I don't know. They killed Wes.

## ...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
Why haven't they killed us!?

## With what? Against how many?
We can't just sit here waiting to die.

## Me? I say you don't have enough brains to be stupid.
...Wes...?

## Can you ride a horse?
No, but I figure now's a real good time to start.

## Which way do we go!?
We go this way.

## When did you make the switch?
But...

## Well?
A car's got to come along sooner or later. When it does, we jack it.

## How do we do that?
You lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt. When the car stops I run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.

## Why do I have to lie in the road?
Somebody has to.

## Yeah, but why me? What if the car doesn't stop?
Then I'm a rich man.

## What?
I'm thinking about taking a trip.

## Still am. There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now... Where should I go?
I don't know.

## How the hell should I know?
Australia.

## Really?
That's what I hear. Don't matter. Girls go crazy everywhere for a man with gold.

## Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
Just...want to be ready when we do.

## Ready for what? Sight-seeing?
The photos.

## Saddam's got a boil on his ass?
Could you stop, please. You're giving me a headache.

## A headache?
Yeah, a headache. My head hurts. You're making me uncomfortable.

## When do you ever point the soles of your feet at people?
I'm saying don't do it accidently.

## Spanish wasn't hard enough?
I thought it would be good to know.

## What does that mean?
Don't shoot me, I'm friendly. You can use that when you surrender.

## What is this?
Now you need me.

## For real? A treasure?
And you're the guy who's going to open it.

## You get it yet?
Naw, nothing.

## You really think there's a treasure inside?
I don't care if there's a lump of coal in here. I just want to be able to rub Epps' face in it when I crack this thing.

## What?
You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.

## Yeah. So?
That's in two days.

## What's your point, Wes? You have a point?
We're going to war, aren't we. If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.

## You ever think about dying?
Come on, man. I almost had this thing open.

## You ever think about it? You ever worry?
At-at-at-at-at.

## Those soldiers have got loafers on. What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?
We...we could go home with something else.

## What?
With...with millions. Millions of dollars.

## Hey, Wes, what kind of treasure you figure these people buried?
If! If there's a treasure.

## Yeah. If. Whatever. What kind you figure it is?
I don't know. It would be small, easy to transport and hide. Gold or jewels. Probably gold.

## You know what I'm doing with my half?
This is too much. You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.

## So, you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel? Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere?
...I figured...I figured you'd turn back.

## Is there anything you do know?
I know you're a pussy. I know that.

## So?
We have to do something.

## Think we can make it?
We make it, or we go back empty handed.

## What do you think?
Lines up with the map and the photos.

## You down?
Yeah, we're down.

## What the hell are you doing!?
I think we found something.

## He lived through that?
Maybe we should give him some water.

## You want to say some words?
You're going to burn up in those.

## Think the Iraqi's killed them all?
Probably shot a few. Scattered the rest. Murderers.

## Cortex bonding....possible temporary. Before you report a possible equipment malfunction, you check the subjects....?
Stress category.

## Correct. Origin?
Birth born....UMMM...Sexact.

## Violation?
Drug evasion with....

## A sinex drop reading of less then 2000 degrees with an accompanying loss of greater then 350 degrees since admission may indicate....?
Permant cortex bond.

## What happened?
See if you can get a reading on tactal retention. Try to estimate it without a meter reading.

## 4732...?
Too low.

## No, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.
4000 degrees is usually the point of....?

## What's this? Why did you change it?
You've seen enough.

## What did you get?
I have to see SEN. I've just been given a shift change.

## When?
Now.

## Now?
He wants me to come to his quarters.

## Then why did you bring it up?
I didn't. You asked me about the card. You're going to get us into trouble.

## Promise...please don't THX leaves the room.
What time is it?

## What are you doing here? Is anything wrong?
No....I though I'm afraid.

## What?
On the cervix transfer, you almost lost the T297.

## What are you doing?
I don't know.

## Are you all right?
AH UGH.

## I thought you were through with it!
What?

## What's going on....what are you doing?
We're leaving.

## What?
We're leaving.

## Who? Who's leaving?
THX and me.

## How far did you go? Was it cold?
You have nothing to fear. You're safe again.

## Well?
I'm sure it's warmer in her than outside, though. I haven't been out yet, but it usually is...the control is fouled...

## What's going on?
I want you for my roommate.

## Where's LUH?
It will be good for both of us. I've got it all arranged.

## What?
I'm leaving.

## When?.....How?
Right now.

## What are you doing here?
I was lost.

## ...and you're not lost now?
No, I...

## Which way?
That way.

## How do you know?
Who? Me?...I don't know.

## What kind of answer is that?
I don't know.

## What have you done, Cut your hand?
Would you like part of this? ....It's not much.

## All right...
No?

## Where's LUH?
Look more closely.

## What do you want?
I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.

## And you are...?
Officer Reilly, vice.

## How's the print coming?
Damn.

## Coffee, Mike?
No thanks, Bev.

## Aren't you on suspension?
Just do it.

## Where did you get this?
Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...

## What do you mean?
Sorry about that. That's an inch of the stuff, imagine what the whole thing'd do.

## What're you talking about?
When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.

## What was-? Why...?
That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner.

## We don't use the b-word. Bad luck.
What?

## So you're the \"Device Squad\"... and you defuse \"devices\"?
Treat. We treat devices.

## Anything else I should know?
Don't push it, slick.

## She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?
Only once, at Redstone.

## Then let's go see what they missed.
Where...?

## I don't know. You tell me?
An abandoned machine shop... nice place to build devices. Low rent, too. But, you and Rice ruined their perfect hideout.

## Cream of the crop, huh? You?
Sounds like terrorist heaven.

## Just how easy is it to build a... device?
Industrial wood oil. Separately, any one of these things could lead in several directions, but together ...

## How long are we going to stay?
Til we get a better lead.

## Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?
Right.

## Why do you do it?
So cut both.

## Which one's which?
I don't know. There's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire.

## What?
You don't have to talk about it.

## Your partner?
I guess I didn't realize how much I needed him. He kept me straight. It's been tough every second since.

## Ex-girlfriend?
Be right back.

## Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.
What's up?

## How do you know?
Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.

## Would you?
No, I'd slip out past the hotel district, behind Greyhound...

## Fuck factor?
Off the scale.

## What do we do?
Talk to me. Let's assess.

## What's wrong?
Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.

## Which one's which?
I don't know.

## What... ?
When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.

## Assist? What the hell you know about tickers anyway?
Easy, guys.

## What do you think?
Call upstairs, see what you can find out.

## Whadaya mean?
It's from an IRA.

## \"Punks\", huh?
Bev, give `em a call, find out what bowling alleys they supply in this area.

## We work fast enough for you?
Political.

## Any word?
Nothing. Maybe they gave up, split town.

## Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner. Coming?
We've lost brothers too, we know what that's like.

## Computer device?
Unlikely. Probably, cash register or something.

## Glass, what is it?
I was wrong... this didn't come from any cash register.

## What do ay say?
Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly. C'mon.

## Who is he?
Alex Swan. My brother. The other two are called Taylor and Leveau.

## Then why tell me?
People are dying.

## I know. I warned them.
You okay?

## What is that?
Security.

## What's the matter?
Nothing... just tired.

## Why are we stopping here?
We're moving' on. I have to pick up the supplies. Just two little boxes.

## Shut up! Who is this?
Drop it.

## What the hell was that?
A ticking bomb...

## Prints?
Nothing so far.

## What about the ballistics report?
Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.

## Nitro, dash of Semtrex, vegetable oil ...
What the hell's going on?

## How're you guys doing?
Still waiting for a miracle. Go ahead.

## Pooch, can you move it?
That's one more time than any of the rest of us have seen it.

## You outta the city... that's a fish out of water. What's with all this family talk lately, anyway?
One of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. When that happens, you'll wish you had family.

## Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery?
What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.

## What was it this time?
She wanted to cook me breakfast.

## You okay?
Yeah, just a nick ...

## Vice cop on a homicide?
Captain assigned me to assist you.

## A what?
IRA - instant retirement account.

## So what're we looking for?
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.

## I'll do it.
Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?

## What?
It's detonation cord, for a bomb.

## I know you're anxious to get back but... just stay out of homicide's way or I'll have you classifying fingerprints, understand?
Report on the case so far.

## She's refused to say a word to anyone. What made you think you could get her to talk?
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.

## Reilly, what the hell are you-?
Yes.

## on staircase; from Gaston's point of view. He stops.
Well, have you found it?

## Yes, M'sieu Laval?
Madame has changed her mind. She'll be down in a minute.

## Is this what you mean, M'sieu Laval?
GASTON erect in sweater, arms folded.

## Why did you let this man in, M'sieu Filiba?
Well, he knocked at the door. You see, I was expecting two--uh--two business associates.

## Niente!
And then what happened, M'sieu Filiba?

## What did you talk about?
About tonsils.

## Goodbye, M'sieu Filiba.
Yes, M'sieu Filiba?

## But before I say goodbye I want to ask you one question, Have you ever been in Venice?
No.

## No ... Have you ever been in Vienna?
No.

## Amsterdam?
No.

## Constantinople?
No.

## And harems ... ?
All.

## Smart. London, eh?
Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy. Beginnings are always difficult.

## If Casanova suddenly ... turned out to be Romeo ... having supper with Juliet--who might become Cleopatra ... How would you start?
I would start with cocktails.

## And, waiter--you see that moon?
Yes, Baron.

## But please, Baron. We're not supposed to breathe a word of it. You won't tell anybody I told you?
You can trust me.

## Are you insinuating that this is not an honest report?
I am only insinuating that you are nervous.

## What do you mean?
You say I am a crook.

## Do you know King Boris?
No--no.

## Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
I would like to.

## That's hotel life. In one room a man loses his wallet and in another room a man loses-- his head.
Disappointed?

## The pepper, too?
No, thank you.

## Last year? It can't be that long.
What time is it?

## Yes! Don't you remember the day you took that Chinese vase from the Royal Palace and made it into a lamp for my night table?
Darling, then let's be honest and return it to the lady.

## Sweetheart, what day is today?
The fourteenth of May.

## Well, we'll have to take what's here. A bird in hand is worth two in jail.
Spanish passports?

## Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
Well, see you at the Berlin Express.

## Are you insane? You've to get out of here at once! She may come back any minute.
By the way, how is your German?

## Don't you realize--
Yes.

## You like that statue?
Not particularly.

## Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.

## Well--how do you do, M'sieu Laval?
The pleasure is mine, madame.

## What's wrong now?
Peaches and cream.

## Do you realize I have light eyes?
But, Madame Colet, that's a matter of eye shadow. I can straighten that out in two seconds.

## Do you know my first name?
No. What is it? Tell me.

## It is beautiful. But I got a little tired of sleeping in antiques, so I gave it to my secretary.
And do you know what I'd like to have you do with that check?

## Oh?
And you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, I would give you a good spanking--in a business way, of course.

## What would you do if you were my secretary?
The same thing.

## Will you be good enough to run through these papers with M'sieu Giron?
I'll be delighted.

## What are you going to do with my day tomorrow, M'sieu Laval?
Beautiful.

## Hair?
Marvelous.

## But you have an engagement, and I don't want people to talk.
Lipstick?

## Talk? About me--about us?
Precisely.

## Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, M'sieu Laval?
No--yours, madame.

## I believe you.
So you think you can get me?

## Then why do you want to go?
Because I want to make it tough for you.

## When a lady takes her jewels off in a gentleman's room, where does she put them?
I wouldn't say anything--I would act.

## Call the police?
Instantly.

## But why talk about robbery on a night like this?
You have been robbed--for years. And not a hundred thousand francs, but millions. And you know who did it? Adolph.

## Adolph?
Adolph J. Giron.

## And you expect me to believe that?
Naturally not. But I expect the police to believe it.

## Oh, that's too bad. You see, I wanted her to do something. Well, I guess I'll have to do it myself.
Yes, Madame Colet?

## What is it, madame?
I wanted to ask her to ask you if you'd be good enough to go out to dinner with me tonight.

## To M'sieu Laval?
He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron.

## Yes, that's the trouble with mothers. First you get to like them and then they die.
You know what Paris is saying about the Countess Falconier and her chauffeur?

## Two lumps, madame?
Please! Thank you.

## About what?
Well--uh--yes and no.

## I think you'd better go.
Yes, madame?

## That's true.
Ever had a romance with a crook?

## Well, he was in the navy.
Then why did you do it?

## Apparently not. Don't you know where it is?
Water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six.

## How much time?
An hour, two at most.

## You're certain?
Yes. In an hour or so... all this... will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.

## Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?
I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.

## You are, Lewis. You rolling?
Shit.

## Don't you mean work me?
Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.

## What?
That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it.

## No, trust me, you want to take this call.
The partners want to know how it's going?

## This is Brock Lovett. What can I do for you, Mrs...?
Rose Calvert.

## ...Mrs. Calvert?
I told you you wanted to take this call.

## Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?
None of the stewards have seen her.

## What could possible be funny?
I put the diamond in my coat pocket. And I put my coat... on her.

## I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
You wanted to see the propellers?

## Not the better half.
You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?

## Where are you going? To him? Is that it? To be a whore to that gutter rat?
Tell her that her daughter died with the Titanic.

## I know. Perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow, to regale our group with your heroic tale?
Sure. Count me in.

## Can I bum a cigarette?
I don't know what she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along fine.

## We gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy?
No, but we're making excellent time.

## Why have we stopped?
We've struck ice.

## Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?
Excuse me.

## How cold?
Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.

## Ever been to Wisconsin?
No.

## Could I speak to you in private?
Uh, yes. Of course. After you.

## So, you got a name by the way?
Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.

## Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?
Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.

## That penguin last night, is he one of them?
Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.

## Is he your boyfriend?
Worse I'm afraid.

## What's this?
Just some sketches.

## May I?
Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.

## And these were drawn from life?
Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off.

## And...?
You wouldn'ta jumped.

## So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?
A whole ten cents?!

## You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
Sure. If you like.

## Jack, must you go?
Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.

## May I cut in, miss?
You're still my best girl, Cora.

## A mistake?
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.

## Sssshh. Come here.
I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it?

## Cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere.
Will this light do? Don't artists need good light?

## Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
Not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out.

## What is it? A sapphire?
To the stars.

## Are you nervous?
Au contraire, mon cher.

## Could it have damaged the ship?
It didn't seem like much of a bump. I'm sure we're okay.

## Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
Right.

## So... how did you find out I didn't do it?
I didn't. I just realized I already knew.

## Will this work?
We'll find out.

## You jump, I jump, right?
Right.

## You think she was really there?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm a believer. She was there.

## Is your stateroom alright?
Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me.

## Would you like anything?
I should like to see my drawing.

## Rose, tell us more about the diamond. What did Hockley do with it after that?
I'm afraid I'm feeling a little tired, Mr. Lovett.

## How can you put this on my shoulders?
It's so unfair.

## Do you want the truth, Anya?
Sure!

## Here's to Europe! Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?
Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.

## I'm sorry, but you three men can play poker or something. Shall I see you tomorrow?
Hope we're not intruding.

## Well--shall we go into dinner?
I'll join you later.

## You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?
Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.

## Thanks. I'll be there. About seven-thirty?
Sooner--if you like. See you again, I hope.

## Why worry? It was insured--how about that swimming lesson I promised you?
How do you do. Would you care to finish the game? I have a slight earache. --and it's so noisy up here.

## Montana?
--that's what we call double-a grade lumber, ma'am; You don't find a knot in a thousand feet.

## Isn't that interesting?
You'll excuse me.

## Will you pardon me?
Gladly.

## Where'd you get it?
Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.

## What did you want a gun for?
Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.

## Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
Guess again, copper.

## We haven't any chips, Mr. Brett--Do you mind playing with cash?
Fine--I'll be glad to.

## Could I see you a minute?
I wouldn't miss this boat for a million.

## Where have you been hiding?
Oh--hello! I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.

## How about giving me another coat?
Good-by.

## You're not very ambitious, are you?
Oh, yes, I am, because afterwards--up here in the moonlight.

## Aw--give a feller a break. My cards are on the table-- I want to know you. How about dining with me tonight?
Never eat before the show.

## Keep your eyes on the ball, Mister.
Well--breakfast? Lunch?

## Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?
I want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.

## What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?
Don't be a c-a-t.

## Yes?
Well, I can't.

## At seven-thirty?
Sooner it you like.

## What are you thinking?
A lot of things I'd like to forget.

## You mean that?
Don't let's talk about it.

## Yes--is it all right if I come like this?
This time I'm really glad you showed up.

## I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?
Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead.

## Who with?
A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.

## What's the matter?
Not here--follow me around the shed.

## Oh, putting on the swell, eh?
I thought you were a smart guy.

## Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.
We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?

## You don't think--?
Yer lucky I'm here at all. I tell you, Jimmy--my feet'll never hold out.

## Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four years ago when I first picked you up, weren't you?
Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.

## How're the tips?
A dollar forty.

## Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
Don't let money spoil a beautiful friendship. Look at these here telegrams to be delivered! This ain't a job-- it's a marathon.

## Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?
Why didn't I think of that?--I am going to scout around and see if I can find her.

## No, sir?
My change.

## Change?
A dollar forty--out of the two dollars I gave you.

## Shortie!--you know my motto?
Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.

## Are you screwy?
I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.

## Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Brett, but I have a message for you.
Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?

## What is it?
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.

## Oh, is she? What a shame! You'll pardon me?
About sixteen hundred.

## Partners, ain't we?
Sure--and to show you I'm a regular fella-- Here's that twenty-five hundred.

## Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
Why--I--er thought with all this heat turned on I'd hide it.

## Where did you hide it?
On the drunk.

## Well, to tell you the truth, gentlemen, I've sworn off playing poker.
How's your mother feeling?

## Before that. Your face is very familiar.
Why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?

## Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?
No, thanks--I never gambled in my life.

## How about you?
No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.

## Why?
Sure, I'll go.

## How about trying your fine Italian hand?
Hey!--you're tickling me.

## Coming to the pool for a swim?
Nooooo!--going to catch up on my reading. I'll take this one.

## Now that that's settled, why not make the game a foursome?
No--I'll take Sally and give you the best of it.

## She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
Oh, Denby--have you seen Sally around?

## I don't know what it is, but I won't use it. Is she entertaining you?
I should say not.

## Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of life--but that--Do I make myself clear?
Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.

## Here you are, sir.
What's that?

## What'll I say?
Eighty cents a word--three--six--nine words. That'll be seven twenty, but it's too much--I'll show you how to save some money.

## Where do you live?
In New York.

## Your wife knows that, don't she?
Sure.

## Right. Here's eighty cents. Send it.
How?

## Just a minute--I don't think we need the word \"Back\" --Where is \"Back\"?
Back is in New York.

## Your wife knows that, don't she?
Sure.

## Wait a minute--What is next month?
Sure.

## So what?
I can see where I won't talk much to you.

## Not yet. Say, where is this boat headed for?
This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.

## Hey, boy--give this man a cablegram blank. Where is your wife?
She's in New York.

## Who won?
Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.

## Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
Let me see now--Don't tell me-- You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.

## Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--

## Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.

## Are you happy?
Will be--as soon as the ship sails.

## Are you paying any attention to his jokes?--the first thing you know, you'll be taking piano lessons from Venus de Milo-- Get out of here.
Am I a member of this club?

## Everything O.K.?
Just what the doctor ordered.

## Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.
Like it?

## Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
No--Inexperienced-- A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.

## I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.

## Women are such fools!--Why do so many of us pass up right guys?
Guess they're dull--nothing for you to reform.

## I'll give you another chance to tell the truth, Lother.
Very serious?

## Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?
Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.

## Meaning what?
You don't shoot squirrels.

## Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?

## --And he has sex appeal.
What's he got that I haven't got?

## So what?
Get that out of your trunk.

## Good-night, folks.
Oh, Chad--what about the rest of the show?

## What for?
Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.

## Can you read 'em Jack?
They're a cinch to read--Queen of Clubs-- --Ace of Diamonds.

## How much did you lose?
About twelve hundred.

## Why don't you leave me alone?
I wish I could.

## That's more like the old Sally--a little bit of fire. How about Ned?
He's all right.

## Of course not-- --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk?
You can't bluff me any more.

## I'm crazy about the kid and I got him into it. What do you want me to do?
Just smile again and be reasonable. I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.

## Congratulations.
--and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?

## Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?

## And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?
Soon as I get that bracelet back I'm going to relax. Wish the guy that borrowed it would help me out--I got to win that fifty bucks.

## Thirty one's and two ten's?
Nothin-- --I just remembered the name of a guy that owes me fifty bucks.

## Do you think Lother could have seen it?
Isn't it great to be away from it all? Aren't you happy? It seems too good to be true.

## That a fact?
Yeah. It's a fact.

## That a fact?
Yeah. It's a fact.

## Talked it over. We decided we Don't need the money. Took out 13 Dollars each, though. Federal Posseman's fee. That all right?
Sure...

## Well that's your problem. Hey Virge, see anything of Doc while You were in Prescott?
Hit a streak when we left. Him And Kate.

## Acquired?
So to speak.

## Pretty fun too, isn't it?
Kinda, actually, yeah. I gotta admit.

## Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
Business is business. Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em. Not If there's money in it.

## Look at 'em all. They love it. How in the hell'd we get Ourselves into this?
Getting late. Guess I'll turn in.

## Virgil?
Wyatt...

## Curly Bill, huh? Who was that Other idiot?
Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest Son. Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable.

## I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
Why don't you just leave it alone?

## Thank you, M. But this is more than your man can handle. Are we in agreement?
I appreciate your assistance, M. But this is now a military operation.

## At least we know where the gold is. When are the recovery ships due?
36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.

## Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?
A piece of advice, Mr. Bond, Don't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton. It's deadlier than uranium.

## How did you get this number?
I'm on my way.

## By the way - what is it that brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mister Bond?
Sightseeing.

## They're merely tools to disseminate information.
So why did you leave?

## ...Words to live by?
Your choice. Look at the time! Come. There's someone I want you meet - about a story I'm thinking of publishing.

## Good-bye, Mister Bond.
...And what's that, my dear?

## Are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl?
...So that's what the weapons grade uranium was for.

## What about the gold?
I'd rather die alone.

## Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait.
Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver?

## Where can I find him?
Him? He, is a she - at the bar.

## Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?
In the darkest moments, it's what I live for. Especially since I've heard how much you like to watch... On the hidden camera.

## We all want what we can't have?
Not all of us, 007.

## Q! How are you?
Retired. I'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore.

## Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?
Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship. Next, your new personal communicator. Picture-phone, fax, beeper.

## Your new car.
Do I have to dial '9' to get out?

## ... 17 Beverage cup holders?
I must say, Q, you seem to be doing rather well in your retirement.

## Don't you think you're overreacting?
...That's all well and good, Captain, save for one thing, There's no gold down there.

## What are you talking about? We went through all this and the ship isn't even down there?
I've got half the British government breathing down my neck. I don't have time for your nonsense.

## Don't you even miss me? Didn't I mean anything to you?
Nothing.

## What about the uranium?
It's on the boat. He's holding a press conference tomorrow.

## His newspapers?
More scurrilous, unsubstantiated gossip.

## Political considerations?
To the best of my recollection, Mr. Bond, I suggested no such thing. In fact, I was never here.

## Now pay attention, 007. We haven't much time to demonstrate your new Q toys.
Okay, Saunders. What is it this time? Rocket in the leg? Machine pistol in the arm?

## How is old Q?
Gone fishing.

## Fishing?
Big game fishing. Sonar torpedoes. Retirement gift from his friends at the CIA.

## Does it work on cash machines?
It was an authorized test. I returned the money.

## If you can't do the time, don't do the crime?
Oh. I almost forgot. There is one last thing, Before Q retired, he asked that I give you one other protective device.

## Wade, what the hell are you doing here?
That's reassuring.

## Something with an engine? Not oars?
Step into my office.

## Tide and current charts. Work backward from the body - find where the ship sank. Where did you get the boat?
Seized it from a guy smuggling computer chips out of Bangkok. Should have seen his rose garden, Blooms the size of hand grenades.

## Natalya?
Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.

## I have to get these to London. Do you know this Captain Cheong?
Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club.

## Can you arrange a meeting?
Hell. The CIA built that club.

## Yo! Jimbo! I won five hundred - What happened?
He tied one on.

## I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out here. How could they get this far off course?
I'm not certain... But I think there's someone I want to press for some answers in Kuala Lumpur.

## ... Does this do anything?
Depends what number you write.

## Married?
Happily.

## Three. You? Married?
No.

## Have we met?
This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor. James Bond.

## Vodka martini, shaken not stirred. And another for you?
No. But you can buy a drink for my friend, Taro.

## Boyfriend?
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.

## And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
Insurance. Lloyds of London.

## No?
No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there.

## Do I have to do everything around here?
I hope so.

## No. I want Sir Elliot to keep them.
And what do you call this?

## What?
You heard me. A gun? I left mine in the car.

## Maybe. But why are we going up instead of down?
This has got to be a mistake.

## ... How did you get into marine salvage?
My father left me the business.

## What the hell does that do?
Cleans dirt. Let's go.

## Down?
Up.

## Are you listening to me?
Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.

## Don't say it.
... We have time for that?

## Is this - like - a normal day for you?
It's a lousy job, but - The only reason I stay is for the health benefits.

## Another reason? Did I miss something?
You insist on calling all the shots. And by the way, I am not a helpless girl.

## If not?
We blast through.

## Sleep well?
Next time, I do the driving.

## ... Yes?
Before we go any further here, Mr. Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just want to get two things straight.

## ... Yes?
First, that boat is in international waters. I'm claiming it for salvage. One-third of that gold is mine.

## And when might that be?
Now.

## Come in, 007. You know the Minister?
Of course. Minister Johnstone.

## Tell me, 007, what do you know about Elliot Harmsway?
Only what I read in the newspapers.

## Which is also why I've withheld this information from NATO and our allies.
... What's Harmsway done?

## I understand.
... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway?

## .... I hate to ask, but... Did you ever think you'd miss Communism?
...You're turning into quite the politician, 007.

## What do you make of all this?
It doesn't quite add up.

## Sabotage?
A three-thousand ton frigate doesn't just vanish into thin air.

## ... And what do you call these?
Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.

## We've already done the interesting part. Do you forget?
Mandarin. You jerk. I'm late. I have to get dressed.

## I am. What do you want?
You have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way.

## What's your name?
No.

## What's wrong?
About every ninety seconds, the auto- pilot jogs us to the west.

## How is it now?
Seems to be back to normal, sir.

## What is HE doing here?
He brought that up from the wreck.

## I regret to inform you, sir, that Saddam Hussein is still demanding a bonus for his role in the Gulf War.
What the hell is going on?

## What about ID's?
One to seven, Deal the face cards.

## Who is it?
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.

## Will it go off?
Maybe. Maybe not.

## Will the cruise set it off?
Yes.

## Since when?
Your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother's birthday was last week.

## What did your wife get her?
We got the same thing.

## Why, you don't want us to bring him over?
Junior spends time with his child.

## Babe Brother, is that my shirt that you're wearing?
Yes.

## How come you're not wearing my shoes?
They're too big.

## When are you boys going to fix that roof?
Soon as I rest a bit. I meant as soon as we are back to normal again, anytime.

## When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof?
You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.

## Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street.

## Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him?
Maybe I can get down there next week.

## Why in the hell didn't you help mama?
I told her I would if she would give me time.

## What is it, noontime?
Because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil Sunny.

## What is a sip of coffee going to do?
Coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child.

## Why don't you come in for a while?
You would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does 1 1/2 baths mean.

## Will you still get the money from your father?
I told him we might not need it, if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property.

## Why does he always pick on me?
He is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love.

## Linda, how come you don't see that Sunny puts his shoes on right?
Why in the h...

## You okay?
I'm okay. Go back to your friends.

## Like a veil has been lifted?
It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters.

## Like muddy waters?
It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.

## You were in hell?
I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body.

## Do you think you won?
It was nip and tuck.

## And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?
I guess it proves you really care about me. You hung in there.

## Who is it?
Babe Brother.

## Doesn't he look a whole of lot better?
Well, you look better than you did yesterday.

## What for?
I'm going back home with Harry.

## What is that?
Boy, that is the real South. That is real corn liquor.

## Never play with someone's else's cards. You always get a new deck. Look at this card. See anything?
It is just a regular card.

## Now how far would further out be?
I'm not here to argue, sir.

## My mind plays tricks on me. Is it okay if I take a bath now?
Everyone is gone. Rhonda is in the bathroom.

## How is the garden doing?
I need to get out there and get those weeds out.

## What, are you having another party?
You better come sit down. You are still sick.

## Gal, you're talking to John Henry. When was I sick?
Since this morning.

## What happened to your hand?
I cut it on an old rusty knife.

## What did you put on it?
It's healing now.

## Why didn't you catch a plane?
My feet have never been on anything that wasn't directly attached to the ground.

## I'm worn out but won't you feel like you are taking in a stranger?
Man, put your boxes down and stay as long as you like. We have empty rooms since the boys got their own families and moved out.

## How often is your wife called to help delivery?
It was slow. Now it seems like everyone is having births at home.

## Haven't the years been good to Hattie?
It hasn't been the years; it's been the men in her life.

## No, if I rest any longer, I won't sleep tonight. May I use your bathroom to wash up a bit?
One can tell you are from back home. These people nowadays don't know what manners are.

## How is everybody?
Tolerable well.

## Ah, you young folks don't know how it is. How is Gideon today?
He wasn't able to get out of bed today.

## Let me get you a cup?
Only if you can spare it.

## How is he doing?
As long as he keeps his throat clear, he is able to get some rest.

## Now who are we talking about?
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...

## What difference does it make if it's persimmon, oak tree or huckleberry bush?
Hocker's death almost caused a race riot. A lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that.

## How many people do you all feed?
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.

## Girl, do you still sing and dance?
No, I'm a different person now, Harry.

## Oh. I'm sorry. Gideon, what do you say?
In the meantime Harry can slaughter us a hog.

## What's a toby?
I thought you weren't old fashioned.

## Did you have your child at home?
Some folks take that natural stuff too far.

## What must I do?
If it was left up to me, I would poison him.

## Whether the boy hears it or not, the man is still a jackass. Everyone should have some mother wit.
When did you talk to Harry?

## What are you doing?
Counting the gray hairs in your head.

## Counting the what? What does that have to do with the price of butter?
I was just trying to make conversation.

## Where is Skip?
He is in his pigeon cage.

## How are you?
You can bring ONE toy...

## Mom! Do you know where Buzz is?
No, I haven't seen him.

## Can I help pump the gas?
Right here in the van.

## But what if we leave them behind?
Oh, don't worry, honey, I'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz before we leave tomorrow.

## Which one can I open first?
Let's let Molly open one.

## Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
Heh, heh...oh yeah, uh, I...

## Uh, let what? I don't -- Uh, what do you mean? Who?
I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.

## Merry Christmas, Sheriff.
What are you doing over there?

## Say, isn't that mistletoe?
Mm-hmmmmm.

## Alright, everyone. You're clear to come up.
I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?

## Toy?
T-O-Y. Toy.

## What's going on?
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.

## Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.

## But we're not on my planet, are we?
No.

## Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
I think you've had enough tea for today. Let's get you out of here, Buzz.

## But why would Andy want me?
Buzz!! What are you doing? I thought you were --

## HEAD Are you peeking?
I dunno.

## HEAD Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot, Woody.
Whaddaya mean, you don't know?

## Have you been replaced?
HEAD Oh, really? I'm from Playskool.

## Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear? Now I'm curious. What does a Space Ranger actually do?
HEAD That ain't no happy child.

## HEAD How did I get stuck with YOU as a moving buddy?
Were you scared? Tell me honestly.

## We believe you, Woody. Right, Rex?
Oh, I don't like confrontations.

## W-w-w-we?
That's right. Your toys.

## Got it.
Hey, Slinky?

## Woody, what are you doing under the bed?
Speak when you're spoken to. He likes his women quiet.

## He can take out his smile and keep it on a shelf, but, his bite is worse than his bark, isn't that so, old fellow?
Mummy was scared of him, I think. He went to her wedding but he was furious, you can see it in the photograph.

## Didn't you know he made things?
Don't fret. It's only his dream. Dreams aren't catching, not like measles.

## What was that in aid of?
Get away from me...

## Is that all?
Ah, you should see the swan! His masterpiece. Now, walk along the beach and stoop to pick up the shell.

## What did I do wrong?
I won't do it because he wants me to do it, even if I want to do it.

## Who's there?
Let me in.

## You are cold. Where have you been?
I finished it off.

## You did what?
He'll murder you when he finds out.

## Can you move over a wee bit?
The swan was so ridiculous. All the same, it did scare me.

## H'm?
I thought she was fondest of you, because you were the youngest.

## Storms?
They're going to fly everywhere. Mean things. They should have taken us.

## Juliet who?
In the play. She was married, by my age. And Mummy. Mummy wasn't much older than me when she got married. Well, not that much older.

## Victoria -
Did you do this?

## You're well built; how old are you?
Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.

## I wanted my Leda to be a little girl. Leda and the swan. See?
Oh no you can't. Get on with the painting.

## I mean, did you ask her? What kind of drugs has she tried?
I... I don't really know.

## Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?
No, of course not. She's one of the top students at her school.

## Anna. What's wrong? What do you want?
I can't find Manolo.

## He never came home last night. Was he with you?
No.

## What? What is it?
It's very hard for me to come and tell you this.

## Why does he need money?
He has debts. He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.

## How much?
Nine thousand dollars.

## What is he planning on telling them?
Well, you know, he's going to say about Madrigal... and Salazar.

## Why are you talking like that?
Arnie, this is crazy.

## What is he being charged with?
Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.

## How much do I pay him?
I suspect he'll accept his payment in publicity.

## Arnie, help me. Doesn't anyone owe us money?
Yes, I told you before, there are people who owe you money but they're not paying. There's too much heat on Carl.

## It's the same. What happened to what they gave you?
It's Saturday, Arnie. You work too hard.

## So Arnie, when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after I got arrested?
I was just waiting for the right time.

## And you didn't feel like you could trust my wife with this news?
I just didn't want to take a chance. I didn't want to risk it. It could have been frozen along with everything else.

## So my wife is lying?
Arnie, do think there's a difference between a reason and an excuse, because I don't think there is.

## Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?
This is different.

## Why?
We don't want to push her away. These are growing experiences.

## I think we may have found our Mexican Drug Czar. It's this General, Salazar. At least I'll have somebody on the other side I can talk to.
How long have you known?

## Does this mean you're going to be gone more?
You might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter.

## Oh, it is?
Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.

## Should we bring the police into this?
No, not yet.

## Where are you going?
She'll be at a pawn shop in an hour.

## Did you meet the President?
Honey, your father knows the President.

## Did you tell Dad?
Not yet.

## Are you going to?
I don't know.

## What do you think?
How well do you know this boy, Seth, who was driving? You know the police have charged him with a DUI and possession of marijuana.

## What's up?
Just watching you.

## What if every country legalized at the same time?
Somehow, I don't see that happening.

## Will we get invited to the White House?
I don't know.

## How long's the job?
It's a presidential appointment so... until I quit or get fired.

## Where is it? Where are the drugs? Where are they?
Fuck you. I wasn't doing anything. You're like the Gestapo.

## Live with your parents?
Yes.

## Parents still together?
Yes.

## Do you work?
I volunteer. I read to blind people. One day a week for two hours.

## In school?
Cincinnati Country Day.

## Private?
Yeah.

## How are your grades?
I'm third in my class.

## What's that mean?
I get A's. All A's.

## What are you doing?
Just watch.

## What is this, like freebase?
Not like. It is.

## Then here's a little bump.
Have you done your homework, honey?

## Did Courtney Love play Nancy in Syd and Nancy?
I think so. If she didn't she should have. I've only got maybe an hour. Then volleyball practice is over and I have to be home.

## No telltales. Nothing to read. Not touching my face. Not even blinking. No giveaways. How're you feeling?
I feel good.

## No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?
Move 'em to Texas, fry 'em up.

## Who do you work for?
They're whispering. I can't hear them, but I know it. I smell conspiracy. I feel the lie vibrating out of the home.

## You want to make a wager on this?
You should see little Montel play. Little Montel is the next Maradona.

## Are you getting this on tape?
I love my job. I love it. The next time I'm having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and I'll get over it.

## What do we do?
I don't know.

## What do you think she wants?
She's your girlfriend. Open it, talk about your kids.

## Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life. Why don't you develop a useful skill?
Yeah, like turning into a beautiful woman.

## What do you think it is?
Depends who it's from.

## What would a law firm want from the new drug Czar?
Depends on the state.

## Medicinal marijuana initiative. Or am I being cynical?
I'll put this in the back.

## I'm on a special phone, may I speak freely?
You may speak.

## You're kidding. Can't you shoot him or something?
I don't really like guns. You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.

## When will you do it?
I don't know. Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl. The security is very tight. There may not be a way.

## This attitude's not gonna help him any, is it?
I got greedy. I decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off. That was my mistake. Carl would never be so stupid.

## This is ridiculous. Why is there no elevator?
When the DEA gets into the narcotics business, then we'll stay at the Four Seasons.

## Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?
I hear these stories. Your husband in jail. His business in chaos. Various people fighting over the scraps.

## My husband had been working on something he called, The Project for the Children. Are you aware of this?
I don't know. Perhaps I remember something.

## Wasn't that General Salazar?
Yeah.

## What's he doing up here?
I don't know. Something.

## Your new friends.
Who?

## Yeah. It should be fun. You wanna come?
Not this time.

## Oh, really. General Salazar was there?
No, but a lot of other people. You should come. You should come out with us.

## What?
Porfirio Madrigal is not dead. I just saw him.

## Where?
A place we have, that we know is protected.

## What's your name?
Javier Rodriguez.

## One question. How did you find about this?
An informant.

## What is the name of your informant?
It was an anonymous tip.

## That's your past. I want to talk about your future. Would you be willing to do something for me?
If I can.

## What is it you want me to do?
A small thing. Nothing really.

## Does this offer include my partner?
Only if he can be trusted.

## The cocaine brand, 911, is an East Coast brand, a Juarez Cartel brand, and you must know it usually comes through into El Paso?
I'm aware of that.

## So what's it doing in Tijuana?
It could mean that, yes.

## That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?
It's possible.

## Is it possible to have a Drug Czar in Mexico who isn't connected in some war to one of the cartels?
My work keeps me young.

## Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?
Michael, you represent drug dealers, not civil libertarians.

## Any way we can do it better?
That triple the amount of stuff is going through.

## Just tell me where she is.
Who the fuck do you think you are? Where the fuck do you think you are? Why the fuck do you think I shouldn't just put you in a dumpster?

## She's not at that place you sent her?
I tried to talk to her when she was up there, but they wouldn't put me through. I'm surprised she hasn't called.

## Can you tell me anything? Do you have any ideas?
I don't know what to say.

## We sometimes went downtown to score.
You won't say anything to my parents?

## I can't believe you used to bring my daughter here, to this place.
What?

## Let me ask you a related question. We've talked about the supply side, but what about demand? What is your policy for treating addiction?
Addicts treat themselves... they overdose and then there's one less to worry about.

## Like you protected Landry?
Hello.

## I'm sorry... Did I wake you?
Salazar's been taken down. He was working for Porfirio Madrigal.

## Who are these guys?
Agents who died in the field.

## I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side?
No. On you go.

## What?
The cards. The last thing I said to you was mind the cards.

## Well, why didn't you bring them?
Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.

## I'm off for a pish. When I come back, that money's still here, OK?
I'll be right after you.

## What?
I've no fucking cigarettes.

## Buy yourself that island in the sun?
For four fucking grand? One palm tree, a couple of rocks, and a sewage outflow.

## What's your name?
Diane.

## Where are you going, Diane?
I'm going home.

## Where's that?
It's where I live.

## What?
I'll come back if you like, but I'm not promising anything.

## Right. You can't sleep here.
Eh-

## What?
Out.

## Holding hands?
No, not holding hands.

## Can I see you again?
Certainly not.

## Are you clean?
Yes.

## Is that a promise, then?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.

## Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell?
No.

## Too young for what?
It's Iggy Pop.

## So why have you told me about it?
Well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, I thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together.

## What? Steady like?
That's right, 'going steady' for four weeks now.

## And what age are you? Thirteen? Fourteen?
Sixteen next month.

## So, what's he like?
Well, he's young and he's healthy.

## What happened?
He forgot. Useless motherfucker.

## What was it, pneumonia or cancer?
No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.

## Eh? How's that?
I bet Lizzy told him where to put it.

## I didn't either. What the fuck is it?
Tommy, let's put the tape on.

## Now?
Yes, I want to watch ourselves while we're screwing.

## What do you mean, it's 'gone'? Where has it gone, Tommy?
It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake.

## Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right?
You were referred here by the Department of Employment. There's no need for you to get you \"foot in the door\", as you put it.

## Are you getting out much?
No.

## Following the game at all?
No. Me Neither.

## You take the test?
Aye.

## Clear?
Aye.

## Have you got any gear on you?
No, I'm clean.

## Another dab?
Would not say no, would not say no.

## I chose not to choose life, I chose something else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who need reasons when you've got heroin?
Nineteen-sixty-seven.

## Running time?
One hundred and sixteen minutes.

## Director?
Lewis Gilbert.

## Eh - Ian Fleming?
Fuck off! He never wrote any of them.

## OK, so who was it, then?
You can look it up.

## Who wrote it?
But you're looking better, it has to be said. Healthier. Radiant even.

## You don't know, do you?
And I wondered if you'd care to go to the park tomorrow.

## The park?
Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.

## Who wrote it?
Roald Dahl. Fuck me.

## Some of his solo stuff's not bad.
What do you mean?

## OK, OK, so what's the point you're trying to make?
All I'm trying to do is help you understand that The Name of the Rose is merely a blip on an otherwise uninterrupted downward trajectory.

## What about The Untouchables?
I don't rate that at all.

## Despite the Academy award?
That means fuck all. The sympathy vote.

## Right. So we all get old and then we can't hack it any more. Is that it?
Yeah.

## That's your theory?
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.

## Do you see the beast? Have you got it in you sights?
Clear enough, Moneypenny. This should present no significant problem.

## What's wrong, Allison?
Oh, fuck. Sick Boy reaches out to Allison.

## What?
You know.

## When are you going to visit him?
Don't know. Maybe Thursday.

## You're a real mate. And what about Tommy? Have you been to see him yet?
You're all hear.

## Why would I want to sell my passport?
It was just an idea.

## What?
There's a mate of swanney's. Mikey Forrester -- you know the guy. He's come into some gear. A lot of gear.

## What was your price?
Four Grand.

## But you don't have the money?
We're two thousand short.

## Are you serious?
Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.

## What's on the menu this evening?
Your favourite dish.

## Your usual table, sir?
Why, thank you.

## And would sir care to settle his bill in advance?
Stick it on my tab.

## Such as sitting in a darkened room, watching videos, drinking, smoking dope and wanking. Does that answer your question?
There.

## Are you serious?
It's the great outdoors.

## It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?
It's fresh air.

## How's it going with Gail?
No joy yet.

## How long is it?
Six weeks.

## Where did she come up with that?
She read it in Cosmopolitan.

## Six weeks and no sex?
I've got balls like watermelons, I'm telling you.

## So what's it going to be?
Well, I've paid for the ticket.

## What?
A walk.

## Well, what are you waiting for?
I don't know, Tommy. I don't know if it's... normal.

## What do you see as your main strengths?
I love people. All people. Even people that no one else loves, I think they're OK, you know. Like Beggars.

## Qual se tu?
It is I. The journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one.

## This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
It could. Yes.

## Why? Why have you done this to my friend?
He doubts me.

## My pain?
It runs deep. Share it with me.

## Is there a problem, gentlemen?
My visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees.

## Sulu, what are you doing?
Plotting our new course.

## New course? You have no authority. What's going on here?
Pavel.

## Position, Bird of Prey?
Closing.

## What's Emergency Landing Plan B?
I don't have a clue.

## Your threats amuse me, Captain Chekov. What consequences did you have in mind?
You are a master of understatement. They are likely to destroy the planet.

## What's going on?
I instruct you to surrender. You are under attack by Federation forces.

## Can we have it quiet?
Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.

## Jim...? Well, we're dressing informally, aren't we?
You caught me on my way to the shower.

## Have the Klingons responded?
No, but you can bet they will.

## What do you know of my pain?
Let us explore it together.

## Where did you get this power?
The power was within you.

## I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?
Join my quest.

## What is it you seek?
What you seek. What all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. But to find it we'll need a starship.

## But how?
Have faith, my friend. There are more of us than you know.

## You told me you could have the ship operational in two weeks. I gave you three. What Happened?
I think you gave me too much time, Captain.

## Mr. Scott, get the transporter working. If we contact a rescue ship we'll need it. Which way to the turbo shaft?
Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.

## Why didn't you beep my communicator?
ER... You forgot to take it with you.

## Put it on the veiwscreen, would You please?
Captain, we're receiving the hostage information you requested.

## Spock - What are you doing in this neck of the woods?
I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite and you pick me.

## And that is?
Because it's there.

## MM.?
I do not think you realize the gravity of your situation.

## On the contrary. Gravity is foremost on my mind. Look, I'm trying to make an ascent here. Why don't you go pester Dr McCoy for a while?
I believe Dr McCoy is not in the best of moods.

## What are you doing?
I am preparing to toast a marsh melon.

## That song did not come up in my research, Captain.
\"Pack Up Your Troubles.\"

## Come on, Spock. Why didn't you jump in?
I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words.

## Captain?
Spock, we're on leave. You can call me Jim.

## Yes, Spock?
Life is not a dream.

## Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?
I cannot be certain.

## But he does seem familiar?
He reminds me of someone I knew in my youth.

## What do you mean?
The knowledge and experience he sought were forbidden by Vulcan belief.

## Why?
He believed the key to self-knowledge was emotion, not logic.

## Yes, Captain?
Be one with the horse.

## There, you see? See?
I have a half brother.

## Why didn't you tell me this before?
I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.

## How do you know?
The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape.

## This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?
He did have pointed ears.

## Is what possible?
That he's found it. Sha Ka Ree. The reason Sybok left Vulcan.

## Hmmm?
Uh-uh.

## What is this?
I believe we are witnessing my birth.

## Spock?
Welcome aboard, Captain.

## Maybe he's not out there, Bones. Maybe he's right here... in the human heart Spock?
I was thinking of Sybok. I've lost a brother.

## Who are you?
James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.

## I trust your message was received?
You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.

## The only realty I see is that I'm a prisoner on my own ship. What is this power you have to control the minds of my crew?
I don't control minds. I free them.

## I've done nothing. This is who they are. Didn't you know that?
No... I didn't.

## Your vision?
Given to me by God. He waits for us on the other side.

## No special conditions?
No conditions.

## What makes you think I won't turn us around?
Because you, too, must know.

## What have I done?
Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully...

## \"Let's see what she's got,\" said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we?
I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.

## Starfleet, are you aware of our currant status?
Easy, easy, easy, Scotty. Easy. You're back with us.

## He's not?
No. Sybok has simply put us in touch with feelings we've always been afraid to express.

## Put him in the brig with Captain Kirk. Spock, you will accompany me to the bridge?
No. I will not.

## Spock?
I cannot go with you.

## Why not?
I belong here.

## Are you embezzling?
\"Embezzling\" is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey... No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together.

## You invented Space Paranoids?
Senior exec.

## Dillinger?
Not if my Tron program was running. That would seal the system off. If your file's in there...

## Uh... got any cinnamon?
Flynn! I made it. I worked out some new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk, and -- it's running.

## Your old files -- ?
And Dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on.

## Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?
Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life...

## How's it going upstairs?
Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready to run, and Dillinger cut everybody with Group 7 access out of the system.

## Did he say why?
Flynn had Group 7 access.

## You call that getting over it?
I mean I want both of us to go.

## What for?
To warn him.

## Of what?
That Dillinger's on to him.

## For what?
For being on to Dillinger.

## Boy, I sit up there grindin' away all day, and you guys are down here disintegrating things and having fun.
What -- ?

## Alan. Alan Bailey.
Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?

## Yeah...?
We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons. Someone with that access has been tampering.

## Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes.

## That all you can say?
No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.

## Oh. Anything else?
Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.

## where's your program? Won't it miss you?
No...

## You said it.
I'm your program?

## Let's get outta here.
So... Nice ship you got here. What's our next move?

## No problem, Master-C. If you've seen one Consumer Electronics Show... What's up?
It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again.

## Flynn?
Yes. It felt like Flynn.

## He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?
It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much...

## The Pentagon?
It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.

## What do you want with the Pentagon?
You wouldn't dare.

## I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
Thank you, no. I have some work to do... assuming I can still log on.

## Yes?
I... have come to communicate with my User.

## Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
All that is visible must grow beyond itself and extend into the realm of the invisible.

## Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
Tanks...coming back. Let's go.

## How about over there...that empty memory?
I'm sorry, Tron... he's... he didn't make it.

## Wrote the...?
It's time I levelled with you, Tron. I'm a -- well, I'm what you guys call a User.

## What about our friend - Sark?
Not us, I hope.

## Did we make it?
Yes.

## How about you?
Aah, I'm fine... little hung over is all...

## A User -- in our world?
Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...

## Boy the view from up here... you know the territory?
A little ... Over there, the Mountains of Data... and I think that's the Silicon Valley...

## What's wrong with that area?
Almost... I just have to adjust our course at the next junction. I'd better go check the instruments ...

## Why? What are you going to do?
Jump.

## But... won't you be de-rezzed?
Probably.

## Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
You're a...\"guest\" of the Master Control Program. They're going to make you play video games.

## Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
Hey, Ram ... what were you ... you know, before?

## How 'bout yourself?
He was disoriented in transport, Tron.

## The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from?
Well...my home \"sector\" was called Paramus ...

## Feel what? You okay?
Alan-One...

## Good luck. You can't even think in here.
What's goin' on?

## Whew. You never were much for small talk. She still leave her clothes all over the floor?
You can see why all his friends are fourteen years old.

## you have any idea how much I can sue these jokers for?
Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.

## You're getting out of the business?
Thank. you, Master Control.

## We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?
Strategic Air Command.

## You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send me somebody with a little moxie ... what kind of program is he?
He's not any kind of program, Sark. He's a User.

## A User?
Wait...I need that...

## The Users...you really think they're still there?
They'd better be...I don't want to bust outta this dump an' find nothin' but a lot of cold circuits waitin' for me.

## You think we can make it there?
We have to.

## Do you know what he's talking about?
I have to find out what Alan wants... that comes first.

## My quarters.
How?

## Why is everything...like this?
It's a flat. But wait a micro...

## It's something Users do.
What is it?

## Where's Flynn?
So I guess you didn't get away

## Can you cover me for an hour?
Just an hour? You should tell this stud to take more time.

## Where are you going?
Out. If Dad doesn't care enough about us to be here on his birthday, then why should I care? I'm going to a movie.

## Where are you going?
Out.

## Where are you off to young lady?
I have a book report.

## Dana, Mr. Hardy called. Why weren't you in class today?
He lies! I was there! I was in the nurse's office, cause I had a headache.

## Dana, are you listening to me?
Yeah, Dad.

## How was school today?
Fine.

## Dad, how come you know the words?
Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.

## Dad. You just think you know everything, don't you?
And this is a little above market- for a total biscuit like her.

## Alright, I want a complete workup on her. Do we know where she is?
Uh huh. Right here in river city.

## Faisil. You're new on Harry's team, aren't you?
Yes.

## Switching to sub-vocal. Gib, you copy?
Fourteen, Harry.

## Uh huh. Want me to lose them?
Helen's going to be pissed.

## Can we go to the office now, Mr. Superspy?
Abu Kaleem Malik.

## You want me to just hang-- ?
Just hang a minute.

## I'll just hang then, shall I?
He-- Helen. Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.

## You know about that?
She's lying.

## You didn't have sexual relations with him?
She could be telling the truth.

## Now what?
There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker. You must work for us.

## We're dead, right? So... where'd you put the transmitter?
In her Walkman. It's the one thing I knew she'd be taking.

## But you didn't. Why not?
I don't know. I guess... I wanted to see what would happen.

## You're not going anywhere.
Is this a common thing for you? Cheating?

## Janice, how many years have you been buzzing us in?
Ten, Mr. Gibson.

## Very good. It's sixth century B.C. Do you like the period?
I adore it.

## Well, what's the point of waiting?
I agree.

## So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters?
That's right. They want something... dramatic. I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see.

## Is that why you got into this business?
I've always been a collector at heart. When I see something I want, I have to have it.

## Yes what?
Uh, yes, it is important.

## Oral hygiene?
Not exactly.

## Did you tell her about us, Harry?
There is no us, you psychotic bitch.

## Hi, honey. How was the flight?
Fine, honey. Stay asleep.

## How'd it go at the trade show? You make all the other salesmen jealous?
That's fabulous Harry.

## What did you tell him?
Baby, I said I'd be there. Really. Trust me. Gotta go, honey. Bye bye.

## What'd you do, honey?
Well I pull out the manual on their setup, which is the new 680 server...

## So, a little excitement in an otherwise dull day. Did is work out okay?
Oh, sure. Fine. I'll get some more gravy.

## How long have you been a member of his faction?
I don't know anything about a faction. I just met Simon... or whatever his name is... a couple of weeks ago. I barely know him.

## What did happen?
Three days later, he called me. He told me to meet him at Overlook Park.

## Why did you continue to see him?
He needed my help.

## Not because you were attracted to him?
No.

## You weren't attracted to him at all?
Well, maybe a little.

## Would you say he was boring, then?
Yeah. I suppose he is.

## Let me handle this part. Do you mind? Why did you go to Carlos' hideout?
He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.

## And you agreed?
Yes.

## Why?
I don't know. I guess I needed something...

## This Simon. Did you sleep with him?
Yes.

## Yes or no.
I love him. I have always loved him and I will always love him. Can I go home, please?

## What do you think? Of course yes! What's involved?
You will be contacted with the assignment.

## So last night was pretty exciting, huh?
What? Oh, the flat tire? Yeah, I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there.

## He's got nothing to do with this. It's me you want, right?
Let the hooker go. She's not important.

## What were you doing there?
You wouldn't believe me.

## Oh yeah? Oh yeah? Then where did I get this?
Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.

## It makes you tell the truth?
Yes.

## Is it working yet?
Ask me a question I would normally lie to.

## 17 years.
Are we going to die?

## My God. Have you had to... have sex with other women in the line of duty?
I don't take those assignments.

## Did you pork her Harry?
No. But I wanted to.

## Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
Looks that way.

## What is it?
God, you have great legs.

## Do you still love me?
Yes.

## As much as you used to?
No. Much more.

## If we're on an island, why are they using trucks?
We must be in the Florida Keys . connects the islands to the mainland.

## What are you going to do?
Go down there and kill everybody, I guess.

## Wait here. If you have to use this, use it. Don't choke. Okay?
... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce. He looked like such a dope.

## What're we talking about here? Pussy, right?
Absolutely.

## So what's your angle?
Sorry. Trade secret.

## Isn't that hard to keep up, in the long run?
Doesn't matter. I like change. You know, constant turnover. As soon as I close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios.

## Dickless. If they took care of * business, I'd be out of business, know what I mean?
Those idiots.

## You working on someone right now?
I always have a couple on the hook. You know. There's one right now, I've got her panting like a dog. It's great.

## What does she do?
Some kinda legal secretary of something. Married to some boring jerk.

## But with you, she gets to be hot, right?
Red hot. Her thighs steam.

## No. Soon as I turn you'll shoot me.
Sooooo... she's pretty good in bed, then?

## I said SIT DOWN. Who do you work for?
Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.

## Of course. Mrs. Tasker. And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal? Taking dictation?
He said he was an American agent.

## Uh... well, okay then. You sound terrible. I'll run out right now. Just call the prescription in to the pharmacy. Sure, no problem. Bye.
What?

## Boris and Doris?
Go ahead.

## So now it's Tasker? Not Renquist?
Now just keep your knees together, and you'll be fine.

## Like one?
Fuck you.

## Helen? It's Simon. Is it safe to talk?
Yes. Go ahead.

## Yes. I suppose so. Where?
The same place. One o'clock. I have to go now. See you tomorrow. Remember, I need you.

## Are you sure you weren't followed?
I kept looking back, like you taught me. I didn't see anyone.

## Where were you? On a... uh, * mission?
Ssshhh! We say Op. Covert * operation. And this one got a little rough.

## Did you read the papers yesterday?
Yes.

## Tell me what happened?
I'm sorry, I can't.

## And you chased one?
Something came over me, I just had nail him, no matter what the times. But I really can't take credit ...

## What is it you want me to do?
Not here. I'll call you and we'll rendezvous again. We have to leave separately, so we aren't seen together. For your safety.

## You'll call me then?
Yes. Now go.

## To our assignment.
What's happened?

## What is it you need me to do?
Helen, I want you to be my wife.

## We're going to Paris?
I don't know. I have to think...

## Thank you. You saved my life. What's your name?
Find out who this Renquist it.

## How?
Use the gifts that Allah has given you.

## Who is this woman?
Yeah, my room-mate leaves it on the TV.

## You're gonna be on \"T.J. Hooker\"?
Knock wood.

## You got that playing basketball?
Yeah. I got elbowed right in the eye. And if that wasn't enough, I got hurled the ball when I'm not looking. Wam! Right in my face.

## Well, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food. What would taste good. What do you think would taste good?
This should cover it, Auggie-Doggie.

## How come?
It's nine o'clock in the morning. Nothing's open.

## What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?
Oh, hush up.

## Ya looked through it?
Tell him to look through it.

## Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?
Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.

## Want some Goobers?
Sonny kicks ass.

## My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.

## Is that your real name? Really?
That's my real name, really. I got proof. See.

## Sure. Why not?
Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.

## What time is it?
Bout twelve.

## No. Not particularly. How come?
I love to get pie after a movie.

## Would you like to get some pie?
I'd love some pie.

## How 'bout me what?
Tell me about yourself.

## What do you want to know?
Ask me them again. One by one.

## What do you do?
I don't remember.

## What's your favorite color?
I don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black.

## What's your favorite movie star?
Burt Reynolds.

## Would you like a bite of my pie?
Yes, I would.

## What kinda music do you like?
Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like \"He's a Rebel\".

## What are your turn-ons?
Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.

## Turn-offs?
I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians.

## Do you have a fella?
I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.

## And in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
Wow. What a swell place to work.

## How long have you worked here?
Almost four years.

## You bet. How much is that worth?
Four hundred bucks.

## What's that?
God, Spiderman looks different.

## Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you then?
Five.

## At the movies?
Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she doesn't want me bothering her.

## What would make you think that?
I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.

## So he really loved her?
Uh-huh.

## What's wrong, sweetheart? Did I do something? What did I do?
You didn't do nothing.

## Did you hurt yourself? Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?
Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there.

## \"Heroes For Sale\"?
Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.

## Who?
My pimp.

## You have a pimp?
Uh-huh.

## A real live pimp?
Uh-huh.

## Is he black?
He thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying.

## Will you be my wife?
Yes.

## You will?
You better not be fucking teasing me.

## Did ya ever see \"The Chinese Professionals\"?
I don't believe so.

## How do you do, Mr. Worley?
Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley.

## Bottom of the ninth . Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you seen your lovely wife today?
Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.

## Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?
No no no no no no no no no...

## Where you goin', honey?
I just gotta get somethin'.

## What?
Write down Drexl's address.

## Why?
So I can go over there and pick up your things.

## You don't know him -
You don't know him -

## Is this a joke?
No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good.

## What?
I think what you did...

## What?
... was so romantic.

## Do you want some wine, sweetheart?
Nope. I'm not really a wine gal.

## You did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do my part OK?
Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.

## Really?
With a vengeance, I hated them.

## What?
Leavin' Detroit. Goin' off on vacations, startin' new lives, business trips. Fun, fun, fun, fun.

## It's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. \"Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancoon\". Don't 'cha think?
But in my movie, baby, you get the top billing.

## What the fuck are you talkin' about?
Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.

## Hold on a second, Big D. You sayin' you eat pussy?
Nigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every motherfuckin' thang.

## With that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you? And gettin' away with it every day. Are you haunted?
Yeah.

## You wanna get unhaunted?
Yeah.

## You'd really do that?
He don't got no right to live.

## How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.

## You don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?
You're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as kissin' his ass.

## Where the fuck is that bitch?
She's with me.

## Who the fuck are you?
I'm her husband.

## Clarence?
You got it.

## You comin' to L.A.? When?
Tomorrow.

## What's up? Why're leavin' Detroit?
Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.

## Money problems?
Now tell him goodbye.

## Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?
Just like in Detroit, only skinnier.

## You goin' out?
Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.

## Did you meet Captain Kirk?
You don't meet him in the audition. That comes later. Hope, hope.

## How much of that letter was on the up and up?
Every word of it.

## For the very first time in my life. Do you know what that's like?
This shit can't be real.

## Do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?
Look, Clarence, I'm not Joe Cocaine.

## What'd'ya tell 'em?
Hardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and what wasn't.

## What's this acting class guy's name?
Elliot.

## Elliot what?
Elliot Blitzer.

## What's to think about?
Shut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're married. You killed a guy.

## I'm just makin' sure we got everything. You got yours?
I got the part on \"T.J. Hooker\".

## Um, nothing, let's go?
What the fuck did you bring that for.

## Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp -
In case of what?

## No, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think about it. How 'bout you, Bama?
Now's a helluva time to play \"what if\".

## Really?
When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.

## What are we gonna see?
A Donny Chiba triple feature. \"The Streetfighter\", \"Return of the Streetfighter\", and \"Sister Streetfighter\".

## Who's Sonny Chiba?
He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.

## You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?
Yeah, OK.

## Look, Dick, I don't -
Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?

## He trusts you?
Sure. I didn't hear anything.

## Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream?
No. No, you don't.

## Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me?
He wants to talk ya.

## Where's everybody else?
They'll be along.

## Yeah?
Get on your knees.

## Don't you?
No.

## Have you read the story on Elvis?
No. Not yet.

## That good, huh?
I can see what you mean.

## Well, then, what's the hurry? Is it true the rights to \"Doctor Zhivago\" are in arbitration?
I don't think that'll be necessary. Let's all have a seat. Boris, why don't you be nice and get coffee for everybody.

## You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?
I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.

## Where'd you go?
A Norms in Van Nuys.

## Why does he trust you?
We grew up together.

## If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?
I bullshitted him.

## Wanna count your money?
Actually, they can count it. I'd like to use the little boy's room.

## Anything stronger? Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?
I can, but I don't.

## Go to the liquor store - Where is there a liquor store around here?
Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.

## I'm really not very -
I really don't know.

## Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is she a four alarm fire, or what?
Yes, I still have friends on the force.

## What makes you think I could do that?
You were a cop.

## What makes you think I would do that?
I'm your son.

## You got it all worked out, don't you?
They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.

## Do tell. Why drug related?
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.

## Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name mean anything to you?
Nope.

## That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me?
Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.

## We do make a cute couple, don't we?
Yeah, well, just stay outta trouble. Remeber, you got a wife to think about. Quit fuckin' around. I love you son.

## I give up. Who are you?
I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.

## What are you talkin' about?
I don't believe you.

## That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?
On their honeymoon.

## I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they go?
They didn't tell me.

## Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?
Sure.

## Oh, don't bother. I got one. So you're a Sicilian, huh?
Uh-huh.

## Come again?
It's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, Drexl Spivey.

## Are you still working security for Foster & Langley?
McTeague.

## You and Robin moved?
I'm me... I mean, that's me.

## Where'd you come from?
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.

## If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that?
Sure. No problem.

## Could we try it now?
Absolutely.

## Where'd he come from?
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.

## That Vietnam movie?
Uh-huh.

## Do you believe him?
I believe he believes him.

## He'll wear a wire?
We talked him into it.

## How the fuck could he know?
He saw the wire.

## How's he supposed to see the wire?
He knows something's up.

## What was I sayin'?
Rock whores.

## You OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?
Naw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.

## What can I do?
You gotta hold this for me.

## Hello, is Dick Ritchie here?
Naw, he ain't home right now.

## Do you live here?
Yeah, I live here.

## Sorta room-mates?
Exactly room-mates.

## How do you know? You been there?
No, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda easy to remember.

## Are you Dick Ritchie?
No.

## Do you know a Clarence Worley?
Yes.

## Do you know where we can find him?
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.

## Where's that?
Well, you go down Beechwood...

## Excuse me, Mr. Coccotti. Do you know Nick Cardella?
No.

## I didn't mean -
Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?

## What was the Jew-boy's name?
Donowitz, he said.

## Him? You saw that man?
Uh, I think so. In the mental hospital.

## You don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, Cole? Have it taken away?
We want tough minded people. Strong mentally. We've had some...misfortunes with \"unstable\" types.

## Cole, did you or did you not record that message?
But just until you recover your, uh,... equilibrium.

## What are you going to do with us?
It's the kidnap woman -- the one who was with the guy who tied us up.

## Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her and some other guy I can't see.
What's she doing?

## And it appeared sequentially after that in...?
San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.

## And your only goal is...?
To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.

## So that...?
Uh, so that a vaccine can be developed that will, uh, allow mankind to reclaim the surface of the earth.

## Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
No, not possible. Listen, I have to get out of here. I'm supposed to be getting information.

## What kind of information?
It won't help you. You can't do anything about it. You can't change anything.

## Change what?
I need to go.

## I see. You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
They wanted identification. I don't have any identification. I wasn't trying to hurt them.

## You don't have a driver's license, James? Or a Social Security card?
No.

## You've been in an institution, haven't you, James? A hospital?
I have to go.

## A jail? Prison?
Underground.

## Hiding?
I love this air. This is wonderful air.

## What's wonderful about the air, James?
It's so clean. No germs.

## You're afraid of germs?
I have to go.

## This is April, right?
No, 1995 is the past.

## I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...?
My father told me that. \"Never cry wolf.\" Then people won't believe you if...something really happens.

## \"If something really happens\"...like what, James?
Something bad. Is that all the music? I don't want to hear this stuff...

## Ohhhh, that one! Can we hear that one?
You were in my dream just now. Your hair was different, but I'm sure it was you.

## We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours. What was the dream about?
About an airport...before everything happened. It's the same dream I always have -- the only one. I'm a little kid in it.

## And I was in it? What did I do?
You were very upset. You're always very upset in the dream, but I never knew it was you before.

## You're flushed. And you were moaning. I think you're running a fever. What are you doing?
My notes. Observations. Clues.

## They're keeping an eye on me.
What do you mean -- when you were a kid?

## Who's keeping an eye on you?
The man...with the voice. I recognized him. He's from the present. He...

## Are you hurt?
Uh, no. Yes. I mean, just some scrapes...

## You didn't have a gun before, did you?
You know Dr. Mason's son, Jeffrey Mason, don't you, James? You met him in the County Hospital six years ago.

## What's the matter with your leg?
I got shot. Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.

## Shot! Who shot you?
It was some kind of...war. Never mind, you wouldn't believe me. Turn off here.

## You were going to run out off gas on purpose, weren't you?
No. I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.

## What have you done? Did you...kill someone?
I'm...\"mentally divergent\". I would love to believe that.

## First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running. Okay?
It would be great if I'm crazy. If I'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay. I'll never have to live underground.

## Okay...you were standing there looking at the moon...you were eating grass... then what?
I thought I was in...prison again.

## Just like that? You were in prison?
No, not really. It's...it's in my mind. Like you said.

## You disappeared! One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?
I don't know -- I don't remember.

## The boy in the well. How did you know that was just a hoax?
...I had a dream about...something like that.

## You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James! How did it get there?
You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything...

## You want me to rob him?
I...I...We need cash, James.

## You... you left them a message?
You... you couldn't have heard me.

## Why are we doing this?
But maybe I'm wrong. Maybe you're wrong. Maybe we're both crazy.

## Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?
No! Look, I don't belong here! What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.

## Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out?
Scientists. I'm supposed to report in to them. They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.

## So you could talk to these scientists and they do what? Send you to the future?
I'm not crazy.

## What's that mean?
They hurt you!

## What are you talking about?
You know -- your plan.

## What're you writing? You a reporter?
It's private.

## What....?
Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load! Listen up -- try and get it together. Focus! Focus! The plan! Remember? I did my part.

## I'm here about some monkeys.
What...?

## Excuse me -- what did you say?
Monkeys. Twelve of them.

## I don't have time to go upstairs. The police are looking for me. I need to know where it is and exactly what it is.
I just need to have access to the pure virus, that's all! For the future!

## Jo...Jose?
The phone call, man. The phone call.

## This part isn't about the virus, is it?
Hey, man...

## I mashed the spider, didn't I?
We'll get to the spider later, Mr. Cole. Right now, we want to know everything that you saw.

## I asked you, why did you volunteer?
Well, the guard woke me up. He told me I volunteered.

## It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number. Did you make that call?
I couldn't call! You sent me to the wrong year! It was 1989.

## But you know what's real now?
Yes, sir.

## He should have been in restraints. It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple. why not just cop to it?
Okay, it was bad judgment. But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and...

## He was fully sedated!
For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he knew about the boy in Fresno and he says three billion people are going to die!

## What...virus?
She knew about it, Jeffrey. She knew you were going to try this.

## What virus are we talking about, Dad?
You're insane, Jeffrey.

## You really want to know?
No! Absolutely not. Don't tell me anything.

## Negative for drugs. But he took on five cops like he was dusted to the eyeballs. No drugs. You believe that?
You have him in restraints.

## You want to go in? Examine him?
Yes, please. You said he gave a name...

## What? What did you say?
Yeah I want something. I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.

## What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on? Sunnin' myself?
I don't know. I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.

## Don't be sorry. Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
I ain't got no eyes. You want to see?

## Change? You want my change? I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
All right, old man. Christ.

## Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?

## That a fact?
I can see just fine. For example, You're a young man who thinks he's got someplace to be.

## What do you want for free?
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.

## Ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
I'm a little short. I'll catch you next time.

## We're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride. Is that it?
More or less.

## Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself; is it worth it?
I'll take a piece of that bet. I say it doesn't come up five times each side.

## Well, a man with some gumption. How much money you got?
Nothing.

## You want to make a kiddies bet?
I'll bet my watch against your pay.

## Never heard of it. It's got no day or date. Hell, it ain't even got numbers. What's the matter? You couldn't afford a Timex?
Next city you're in take it to a jeweler. He won't give you less than four-hundred for it.

## Thirty-bucks? That's it?
That's my morning's pay.

## I'm a rich man off of thirty bucks?
One-hundred-thirteen degrees. That was back in July of forty-seven. Now there ain't no way it's gonna be hotter than that.

## You got two years on me. What's that make me?
It's nonsense.

## And what are you? A rocket scientist?
I got more brains than you've got teeth.

## Can I help you, sir?
I need a ticket.

## Where to?
Out of here.

## But, in particular?
I ... Mexico. You got a bus that goes to Mexico? That's where I have to go.

## One way, or round trip?
One way.

## You Harlin?
Nope. Darrell.

## Harlin around?
He's up at the Look Out.

## Will he be back soon?
Doubt it. He's dead. The Look Out's a cemetery.

## You own this place?
Yep.

## Then why do you call it Harlin's?
Cause Harlin used to own it.

## It's your radiator hose. It's busted.
So?

## Yeah, I can fix it. Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
I know it's busted. What did I just tell you?

## How much time?
Time.

## What time is it now?
Truck stop up a piece. Not much, but us simple folk like it.

## I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
Just a car.

## How much?
Well ... parts, labor ... let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.

## How much!?
Hundred-fifty.

## A God damn radiator hose in a sixty- four-and-a-half Mustang. You know how long it took me to find that hose?
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.

## That's a Ford, not a Ferrari. You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.

## What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
I don't know, but it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through. Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.

## You've been there?
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog. Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.

## You believe that?
You think bad, and bad is what you get.

## What?
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.

## Come back when the sun comes up.
What you want?

## What the hell ... oh it's you. Might've figured. What do you want?
I want my car.

## You got the money?
Two-hundred dollars in hundred- dollar bills. And this morning you was broke.

## What's it to you?
I don't want no dirty money. I run an honest business.

## What would a truck stop be without beer?
Let me have a Beck's.

## Kirin?
No, we ain't got no Kirin. We got Miller.

## No. We got Miller. Regular Miller. You want it, or don't you?
Yeah, give me the Miller.

## What was that all about?
You know how that Toby is. Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.

## Poor thing. Is she all right?
Lord! Put the baby in the icebox. Killed the poor thing.

## It'd serve you right. Jose, run get a mop and clean this mess up.
Ned! Now look at what you done! Are you all right?

## That yours, Mrs. McKenna?
Yes. Yes it is.

## What do you want?
Same thing you want. I want to be out of Sierra; to be able to do as I please. But that takes money.

## ...at the very least. I know there was more than thirty-thousand dollars. Now, how much did you get?
Don't tell him anything. He can't do this.

## Can't I? You're out in the desert, all alone, with a body in your trunk. What do you think, boy?
There you go, Mrs. McKenna. Just put it in there.

## Who was that on the phone?
Wrong number.

## You spent a long time talking for a wrong number. But then you make friends so easily. Don't you, Grace?
I put up new drapes, Jake.

## I know. I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?
Nothing, Jake. Absolutely nothing.

## You didn't hear something?
How could I? I was sleeping.

## When did you buy a gun?
I'm just going to my car.

## Do you have to call me that?
I don't know your real name.

## It's Grace.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?

## May I carry your package, Grace?
Jesus.

## You sure you can manage?
I got it.

## Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
No, I've got it.

## What happened to your hand?
Accident.

## I saw these in the Penny's catalog, and I just knew I had to have them. You ever seen something and just knew you had to have it?
Yes, I have.

## Why you say that? Just because I help a lady with her package?
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.

## Drove into Sierra? What for?
Didn't have a choice. My car overheated up the road.

## Where you coming from?
All over. Chicago, Miami, Detroit. Just lately Albuquerque.

## Where you headed?
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work. You must like taking chances.

## What happens if you lose?
I pack up and go somewhere else.

## Did you like it; me watching you?
I guess. I've got an ego same as any man.

## What do you do anyway?
A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.

## Where'd you learn to do that?
From my father. He was the tribe's Shaman.

## A medicine man?
Those are white words, not ours.

## It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want. What is it you want?
The same thing you do.

## What?
Lift me down.

## Beautiful?
Like they're made of polyester.

## No more drapes to hang. Now what should we do?
I have ideas.

## Such as?
All right, Grace. No more games.

## Games?
You flirt with me, then you run cold. You lead me on, then slap me down. I don't go for being jerked around.

## Really? And what game did you want to play? You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
I think I can find my own way back to into town.

## That's not an answer. What is it you want?
You know what I want.

## You love him?
No.

## Did you ever?
I'm guessing no.

## I'm still here, aren't I? See this?
You could just leave him.

## How far is it to California?
From here? I don't know. Far. Far enough.

## Have you ever been there before?
Yeah.

## Is it pretty?
Beautiful. Beautiful beaches. Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.

## Where?
Jake.

## You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?
He doesn't give it to us. We take it.

## From?
You live pretty good.

## How much money has he got?
Near as I can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.

## We'd have to kill him.
Lied? What do you mean?

## John? John where are you going?
John, please--

## What are you talking about?
Kill someone. I can't do it.

## I thought you would be on your way to Vegas by now. Is there something you wanted?
I wanted to talk.

## There is no us, remember?
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.

## Why? Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
Because I know you're full of shit.

## Is that what changed your mind? The money?
I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole. There's only one way to do that.

## Are you sure? About me, I mean?
I came back for you; this morning I came back. Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.

## Grace ... Grace?
After dark. I'll leave the back door unlocked.

## What was I supposed to do?
You could have hit him, or kneed him in the balls.

## Where's the safe?
I don't know.

## You don't know? Jesus Christ! Don't you think you should have found out before we killed him?
I'm not sure where it is. Not exactly. I never saw it. I just heard him talk about it.

## There's easily a hundred-thousand in there. More than that.
If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?

## I told you. I knew it was there. Didn't I tell you?
If you want.

## What about him?
Let him watch. I want him to know what he's missing.

## You got a suitcase?
Never needed one. I've never been anywhere. I've got a backpack.

## Where are you going?
To get my car.

## Wait. What about ... him?
Put some clothes on him. When I get back We'll load him in the trunk and dump him in the desert. It'll takes days for anybody to find him.

## John!? What the hell's the matter with you?
I ... nothing. I just stubbed my toe on a rock. Hurt like hell ... that's all.

## John ...?
Sheriff Potter, please. I can't go to jail. I wanted no part of it.

## What?
You heard me. Count it out.

## You're crazy, you know that!? You're fucked up!?
Just drive.

## I know. He was to take the fucking money.
Jesus, Grace. Did you have to kill him?

## Is that the kind of girl you think I am? What can I do to make you relax?
You could give me the gun.

## Now what?
Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.

## I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you. Don't you think I care about you?
I think I busted my leg.

## I can't make it. Grace? Grace!?
I'm here.

## Where the hell am I going to go?
John, you have to throw the keys up to me.

## What for?
The trunk. It's locked.

## You closed it, didn't you, Grace?
I was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up.

## And you're not one to lie, are you?
Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.

## Why don't you come down and get them so I can wring your pretty little neck?
John, if you don't throw me the keys, then I'll just walk away. Walk away and leave you here.

## Who the hell are you?
I'm her husband.

## Husband ...?
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.

## What happened to your hand?
Accident.

## What brings you to Sierra?
My car overheated. I pulled in to have it fixed.

## Where you headed?
I've got to make a stop in Vegas, then I'm heading to Santa Barbara.

## Live there?
Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.

## Why would I kill her?
I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.

## Good Lord. What happened to you?
Just ran into a little trouble.

## Another accident? You've really got to be more careful. Can I get you a drink?
No.

## Hungry?
No.

## You just seem to attract trouble, don't you?
Nice office you've got.

## Now what can I do for you?
I was hoping we could talk.

## Talk? About what?
About things. About your wife.

## Sweet Grace? What about her?
About what you said this morning.

## I did?
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.

## What makes you say that?
Because I think you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.

## And what does that make you?
The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you.

## And for that you'd kill Grace?
For that I'd kill a nun on Easter Sunday.

## I put it at fifty-thousand dollars, minus your cut, of course. Which is?
Make it twenty.

## How much could you get?
Maybe ... ten-thousand. And that's a maybe.

## If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...?
I guess I might as well get this done with.

## What should I do?
How the hell should I know? I've never had a wife killed before. I guess I should have hired a professional.

## And tell her what?
I went to your place. We talked, just like you told me. We drove out into the desert ...

## Is the job done?
No.

## You didn't kill her?
The time wasn't right.

## You know so much about killing why don't you do it yourself?
I guess I have what you'd call a love-hate relationship with Grace.

## You love her, but you hate her?
All I have in the world.

## Trouble with the car again?
You could say. I don't even have it yet.

## Darrell giving you problems?
He did more work on the car. He wants fifty bucks extra for it.

## You came to take my wife from me?
I came to kill her.

## Wh ... what are you talking about?
You're not talking sense.

## What are you babbling about?
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.

## You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table. Now, I'm not going to ask you again, Mister. What were you doing with my girl?
Honest, Toby. I just asked him for a quarter for the jukebox.

## What happened to your hand?
Accident, and yeah, I got to be more careful.

## Got any requests?
That country shit all sounds the same to me.

## How about I pick one out for you?
You like Patsy Cline? I just love her. How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.

## Gee, that's sad. Don't that make you sad?
I've had time to get over it.

## You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?
Oz.

## For what?
For defending my honor this afternoon.

## How old are you?
Eighteen. Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.

## What's your name anyway?
Will you shut up!

## Make time? Is everybody in this town slap happy?
Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.

## You expect me to believe that?
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.

## What? You want to fight? Over her?
You're fucked.

## They're not very imaginative?
Cause I'm just like dynamite. And when I go off somebody gets hurt.

## I wasn't sneaking around with your girl. Would you please tell him?
Yeah, I know. You're TNT. Just like dynamite. When you go off somebody gets hurt. All right. Let's do this.

## What the hell are you doing? Are you crazy?
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended. I'm beating you up.

## With a shotgun. It kills him, and it shreads the money. I mean, what are the odds?
You're the gambler. You tell me.

## Do you understand me you little fuck?
Yes, Mr. Vesci.

## What happened?
Jesus!

## Like I said; you really can't blame the boy. Some people don't know how to avoid trouble. Know what I mean?
Saw you at the truck stop this morning. You're not from around here.

## Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
Nope. No problems up the road.

## Now step around to the back of the car and open the trunk for me.
Why don't you step out of the car, son?

## What for?
I think you might just want to do as I say.

## Soda. You got any soda?
Yeah I want something. I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.

## What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on? Sunnin' myself?
I don't know. I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.

## Don't be sorry. Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
I ain't got no eyes. You want to see?

## Change? You want my change? I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
All right, old man. Christ.

## Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?

## That a fact?
Maybe I do.

## What do you want for free?
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.

## What?
...And everything is nothing too.

## I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?
Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's. This town's all inbreeding.

## ...But ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.

## So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride. Is that it?
More or less.

## Time's up. Any last words of wisdom?
You are crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old man.

## Make time? Is everybody in this town on drugs?
Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.

## You expect me to believe that?
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.

## Let's see...they're not very imaginative?
Cause I'm just like dynamite. And when I go off, somebody gets hurt.

## Oh, shit!
Fine. I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?

## I wasn't sneaking around with your girl. Would you please tell him?
Yeah, I know. You're TNT. Just like dynamite. When you go off somebody gets hurt. All right. Let's do this.

## Who the hell are you?
I'm her husband.

## What the fuck do you want?
I'll give you a lift, son. Too hot to be walking... People die out here, y'know.

## Say, what happened to your hand?
Accident.

## \"Bobby Cooper.\" What brings you to Superior, Coop?
An overheated car.

## Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?
Darrell's a moron.

## Live there?
Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.

## Would you kill her?
I've done a few things but I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.

## What can I do for you, lad?
I was hoping we could talk.

## Talk? About what?
About things. About your wife.

## Sweet Grace? What about her?
About what you said this morning.

## I did?
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.

## What makes you say that?
Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.

## And what does that make you?
Well, I guess I have what you call a love-hate relationship with Grace.

## How much could you get?
Maybe ... ten-thousand. And that's a maybe.

## How do you want it?
You want to do this yourself? I don't have to do this, you know.

## And tell her what?
I know you're not surprised I'm back here, cause you can read my mind and all.

## I guess this is what they call \"ironee\"? Hunh?
It's not what you think, Jake.

## You came to take my wife from me?
Shhh! Liar.

## You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
How the hell did you know where the bedroom's at?

## What happened to your hand?
I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.

## Got any requests?
That country shit all sounds the same to me.

## How about I pick one out for you?
You like Patsy Cline? I just love her. How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.

## Gee, that's sad. Don't that make you sad?
I've had time to get over it.

## You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?
Oz.

## For what?
For defending my honor this afternoon.

## How old are you?
Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.

## No, I don't want to take you for a ride. What I want is for ... Hey, you don't think you can get $150 from your parents, could you?
You're too late, Toby. We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.

## What's your name anyway?
Nope. Darrell.

## Harlin around?
He's up at the Look Out.

## Will he be back soon?
Doubt it. He's dead. The Look Out's a cemetery.

## You own this place?
Yep.

## Then why do you call it Harlin's?
Cause Harlin used to own it.

## OK. Darrell... Could you just take a look at my radiator hose. It's busted.
So?

## So?
It's your radiator hose. It's busted.

## Okay, I'm stuck. You happy? Now can you fix it, or not?
Yeah, I can fix it.

## How much time?
Time.

## I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
Hey.

## Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?
Nothing.

## What the hell happened to my car?
Bottom hose was shot too. Rotted clear through. Had to put a new one in. Runs like a dream now.

## How much!?
Hundred-fifty.

## A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang. You know how long it took me to find that hose?
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.

## What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
I don't know, but \"it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through.\" Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.

## You've been there?
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog. Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.

## You believe that?
You think bad, and bad is what you get.

## What?
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.

## What sign?
What reputation? You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.

## What the fuck did you do to my trunk?
Well, that key's not gonna work. I had to pop the lock. You didn't leave me the trunk key.

## And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
When I work on a car, I work on a car.

## We're closed. Come back when the sun comes up.
What you want?

## What the hell ... oh, it's you. Might've figgered. Listen I got a waitress coming over. What do you want?
I want my car.

## You got the money?
Two-hundred dollars in hundred-dollar bills. And this morning you was broke.

## All I got's a hundred, Darrell. You got change?
No.

## Soda. You got any soda?
Hablar slowly, por favor. My ingles no es bien.

## I'm just going to my car?
That's right on my way.

## Do you have to call me that?
I don't know your real name.

## You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
I like that about me, beautiful.

## May I carry your package, Grace?
Jesus.

## You sure you can manage?
I got it.

## Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
No, I've got it.

## What happened to your hand?
Accident.

## Why you say that? Just because I help a lady with her package?
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.

## Drove into Superior? What for?
Didn't have a choice. My car overheated up the road.

## You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert. Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?
Not until my car's fixed. I don't know how long that's going to take.

## Where you coming from?
All over. Chicago, Houston, Detroit. Just lately Dallas.

## So, what is it you do, Mister...?
Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .

## What happens when you lose?
I pack up and go somewhere else.

## Did you like it; me watching you?
I guess. I've got an ego same as any man.

## What do you do anyway?
A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.

## Where'd you learn to do that?
From my father. He was the tribe's shaman.

## A medicine man?
Those are white words, not ours.

## It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want. What is it you want?
The same thing you do.

## What?
Lift me down.

## You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?
Like you.

## Beautiful?
I like them. I was sick of looking at this room. I think they add a little life.

## No more drapes to hang. Now what should we do?
I have an idea.

## And what would that be?
You flirt with me, then you run cold. You lead me on, then slap me down. I don't go for being jerked around.

## Really? And what game did you want to play? You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
I think I can find my own way back to into town.

## That's not an answer. What is it you want?
You know what I want.

## How do you know he's still not here?
Guys like me take those chances. Let's go.

## Are there snakes out here?
They hear you comin'. They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.

## You love him?
No.

## Is that why you're with him?
I'm guessing no.

## I'm still here, aren't I? See this?
You could leave him.

## What's the matter?...Grace?
Nothing.

## You mean the Shaman?
Yeah.

## Yeah. What do you want. Life, right? Have you ever been to California?
Yeah.

## Is it pretty?
Oh yeah. It's beautiful, beautiful beaches. Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.

## You don't have any money put away, do you?
Jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't want me goin' anywhere...

## Where?
Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it.

## In cash?
One-hundred-thousand!? That son-of-a-bitch.

## If the key's on him, how do we get the key?
Kill him.

## There is no us, remember?
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.

## Why? Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
Because I know you're full of shit.

## Is that what changed your mind? The money?
I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole. There's only one way to do that.

## Are you sure?... About me, I mean?
You said you couldn't kill anybody.

## Grace ... Grace?
I ... nothing. I just stubbed my toe on a rock. Hurt like hell.

## Good thinking. What's all this?
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.

## I don't know about that?
You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.

## Can't we just dump him fast someplace?
I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace.

## Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
I'm not sailing his boat.

## What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?
You already have.

## What are you talking about?
Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you and me.

## Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?
Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a past...

## Don't you think I would've done it if I wanted to? What can I do to make you relax, baby?
You could give me my gun back.

## You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
I believe in this moment, that's all. There is nothing else. Come on. He must weigh 300 pounds.

## I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?
I think you're a lying, back-stabbing psycho bitch, and one day you'll kill me. But it's nice to know you cared...

## Can you make it back up?
Grace -- in the trunk of my car is a tow rope. It should reach down here. Go get it, throw it down.

## Why's that?
Cause I love you.

## Where ya goin'?
Harlin's.

## Seen you popping up a little bit of everywhere today. You're not planning on staying are you?
No, sir. I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.

## The old lady?
Which you don't have.

## Where to?
Out of here.

## But, in particular?
I ... Mexico. You got a bus that goes to Mexico? That's where I have to go.

## One way, or round trip?
One way.

## What kind?
Beck's.

## Heineken?
No, we ain't got no Heineken. We got Miller.

## Genuine Draft?
No. Just plain ol' Miller. Now you can fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave it.

## What was that all about?
You know how that Toby is. Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.

## You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?
No baby, you got it wrong.

## This road don't go to Globe, Grace -- where were you going to meet me?
Wrong number.

## You spent a long time talking for a wrong number. But then you make friends so easily. Don't you, Grace?
I put up new drapes, Jake.

## I know. I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?
You never said anything. About the drapes.

## What the hell you looking at, girl?
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.

## Like you helped her, Jake?
I axed you a question.

## You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table. Now, I'm not going to axe you again, Mister. What were you doing with my girl?
Honest, Toby. I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox.

## I am Russian, da! I am also rich Russian, da? Maybe we work something out, my friend Sheriff?
What? You trying to bribe me, mister? Just cause you Russians ain't commies anymore, don't think money can buy everything...

## What's that? ...\"concealed\" is a definite no no in this town, Ivan. You know anything about Jamilla's grocery store?
No sir he is not. I read about you in the paper.

## Is that the entire message?
Yes.

## Once again please?
My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.

## How old is Jeb?
Four.

## What did I say?
I'm listening.

## What about Jeb?
I have a lock on the door.

## What does that mean?
I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.

## Is Jeremy okay?
He's asleep.

## Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick?
...I can't remember.

## That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?
It means we're probably to tired to remember.

## Is that what you wanted to ask me?
Yes.

## When was the last time I wore pink?
The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.

## Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?
My name is Megan Inverso. We went to college together.

## What do I do when I'm around someone I know?
You use your sleeve.

## out again?
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.

## Jeremy what the hell are you doing?
...I think rust.

## As a color, not as rust. You know, a rust colored paint or wood?
I didn't know that. Mine's still brown.

## My turn. What's your favorite song?
Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.

## What was that?
We're supposed to be honest.

## My turn. When was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it?
I'm not sure.

## What about the game?
That counts.

## Why?
I don't know Megan.

## You've never been sick?
I don't know for sure. ...I don't think so.

## How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?
Seventy-five percent.

## What's he talking about?
In college. A car accident.

## Was it serious?
I assumed because of the train.

## At the church... You were following me weren't you?
Technically no. I gambled that you would attend the church service. I just waited for you.

## What's this about? This is obviously some scam. Is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment?
You've misunderstood.

## What do you want?
Not money. But I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution.

## Are you for real?
Just give me a minute.

## Is there a problem?
I got you a seat in the seven hundred level. It's nose-bleed territory, but at least you won't get spit on.

## How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.

## You thought he was carrying a knife?
I thought he was carrying something.

## But not a knife?
I got this picture of a silver handled gun tucked in his pants. Like on t.v.

## Telling when people have done something wrong?
Yes.

## I don't know what you're asking?
You're skill.

## The car accident you were in... Was there anyone else involved?
I must have felt some lump in his back when I bumped him. Most guns have a black or silver handle. I had a fifty-fifty shot at the color.

## Are you finished?
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.

## What's he look like?
He's got the most beautiful eyes... The hell kind of question is that? He's a guy.

## Yeah?
There's a message for you at the office. Your kid was hurt.

## When?
Just now. They want you to come down to his school.

## Jeremy, why don't you go sleep with your mom?
I want to sleep here tonight.

## Just play one set of downs. I told them you were great.
How about your room then? If you get scared like before, you can come back in here?

## Jeremy. I'm going in. I have to do some things.
Why'd you do that?

## What things?
I'm going to work out.

## You think you could beat up Mike Tyson? I mean before he started wiggin out and eating people's ears?
No.

## Not really... Maybe a couple of Peacemakers... I imagine you could overlook those, eh, Bill? If you didn't see them... or hear them?
I guess not, Bob. I don't like guns around.

## Enemies, Bob? You been talking about the Queen again? On Independence Day?
Mmmm pistols.

## He admit it?
No... but I guess he will soon enough. Had a Spencer rifle on him an' he was...

## Those cowboys messin' him up?
Uh... a little, maybe.

Property.

## Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me. How do you like her?
Heard you done the roof yourself.

## What's all that wood?
Porch. I'm puttin' a porch on her so's I can puff my pipe of an evening an' drink my coffee an' watch the sun set.

## An' all them cowboys been riding that beef down to Kansas an' Cheyenne?
Yup.

## All week?
I didn't hear nothin' till last night.

## That much, huh?
You could run off them two cowboys.

## Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns.

## What's your name?
Uh, William... uh... Hendershot.

## You work for the railroads too, Mister Beauchamp?

Uh... Duke.

## You were there?
First off... Corky didn't carry two pistols, though he should of.

## You... you mean... English Bob killed him while...?
Well he wasn't gonna wait for Corky to grow no new hand. He walked over real close, bein' drunk, an' shot him through the liver.

## But... if he doesn't miss?
Them's the keys. All you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' English Bob can ride out free as birds.

## Is... is it... loaded?

## Ned's share?
Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before...

## Who killed him?
Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...

## He hanged him? Shot him down?
Good example! Good example of what I'd like to know? He didn't even kill nobody... he couldn't do it no more.

## The questions Little Bill asked him... what sort of questions was they?
About where you an' him was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'...

## Then... what?
A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T...

## N-no, sir?
Lemmee see that Schofield, Kid.

## Same one as shot Charlie Pepper in Lake County?
You shot Charlie Pepper, didn't you? And you're the one killed William Harbey an' robbed the train over...

## He said that, huh?
I'm a damn killer myself, only I ain't killed so many as you because of my youth. Schofield Kid, they call me.

## Schofield? You from Schofield?
On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.

## About what?
Bein' my partner. I'm headin' North up around the Niobrara in Nebraska. Gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys.

## What for?
For cuttin' up a lady. They cut up her face an' cut her eyes out, cut her ears off an' her tits too.

## Huh?
He's my partner. He don't go, I don't.

## Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you?
Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...

## What business?
Well... I don't recollect.

## He ain't dead? You didn't get him?
He got the boy's horse.

## Did you kill him?
He's clear of the horse, Ned. Better get him.

## What happened? He ain't dead? What's goin' on?
If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there.

## What happened, did you hit him?
Better re-load it.

## You missed him? You didn't...?
I got him.

## They takin' water?
Yeah.

## When we gonna double back?
After a ways.

## You still think he's in there?
Yeah, he's in there.

## You... you ain't gonna shoot him yourownself?
You can shoot him.

## Is it him?
Yup.

## Did... you... get... him?
Yeah.

## Shit... I thought they was gonna get us. I was even... scared a little... just for a minute. Was you ever scared in them days?
Say, Bill...

## First one what?
First one I ever killed.

## Yeah?
Well, that fella today, you shot him alright.

## Wha... what f-for?
Lemmee see it.

## You... gonna take... the money?
You better get on back, Miss.

## Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill?
I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle.

## You're gonna kill him, ain't you?
Stay clear of folks you might see. There's plenty out lookin' to hang you. Go on now, skedaddle.

## You sure you ain't armed?
I never c-c-carry arms. I'm... a writer.

## A writer? What do you write... letters an' such?
B-b-books. You... you killed five men... singlehanded.

## Huh?
Wh-wh-when confronted by superior numbers, the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first.

## Yeah?
I was lucky in the order. I always been lucky killin' folks.

## Who was next? Clyde? Or was it...?
I could tell you who was last, mister.

## How long since you shot a gun at a man? Nine... ten years?
Eleven.

## Well, we thought we was doin' it for money... What'd they do anyhow? Cheat at cards, steal some strays, spit on a rich fella?
Cut up a woman. Cut her eyes out, cut her tits off, cut her fingers off... done everythin' but cut up her cunny, I guess.

## How long you gonna be, Bill?
Two weeks, I guess.

## Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?
Yeah, an' I could still hit a bird in the eye flyin'.

## Sally?
She gave me the evil eye.

## Say, Bill... You ever... ever go into town... an' all?
Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.

## Whaddaya do, just use your hand?
Sometimes... yeah. I don't miss it all that much.

## He hit you?
Naw. I bumped my head fallin' off of my horse.

## He ain't shootin' our way no more. He's shootin' over that way. Who's he shootin' at over that way?
Beats the hell out of me.

## You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
I didn't see nothin' planted.

## Why would the Kid shoot at us?
HEY KID, IT'S ME, BILL MUNNY.

## How far kin you see?
Jesus.

## I know it's rainin', Give the Kid a drink, why dontcha?
No.

## Yeah?
I remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two.

## You... you remember Eagle Hendershot?
Huh? Uh... yeah.

## Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will you?
Worms was comin' out.

## Who, Bill? Who got snake eyes?
The angel... the angel of death. I'm scared, Ned. Ned, I'm gonna die.

## Well, that's good now, ain't it, Bill? Seein' Claudia an...?
She was all covered with worms. Oh, Ned, I'm scared of dyin'...

## HOW MANY LEFT GODDAMIT?
Two.

## You want the Spencer, Bill?
Shit, Ned, this ain't the time to quit.

## Supposin' he don't go to the ranch?
I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. Right off he'll hole up at the ranch.

## What is it, son?
Two more hogs got the fever.

## Who's he?
Best we move that pig.

## Tom?
The one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol...

## He say anythin'... The Kid... ?
Tom? Only how... how if you didn't... didn't come back in a week... how we was to take half the money to Sally an' say you was...

## All that money... I mean... did you...?
Steal it? Naw, I didn't steal it.

## Who said that?
N-nobody... only you took your shotgun an' that pistol an'...

## What was you shootin' at us for, anyhow?
Thought you was followin' me.

## You gonna share your half with him?
Clouds, Kid. We was lookin' at them clouds on account of we got a storm ridin' up our ass.

## Yeah?
I'm a damn good shot. See that hawk up there? I could kill that hawk with one shot.

## We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards?
More.

## See that scrub oak yonder?
Fuck you.

## Say, Ned... ?
Yeah.

## How many men you killed? Ain't you gonna answer?
I don't like the question.

## How many you killed, Kid?
Five. I killed five of 'em. That counts a Mexican I killed. He come at me with a knife.

## Jesus. You done this before?
Plenty of times.

## He didn't even pull his pistol, huh?
He ain't as tough as you, Kid.

## Depends what he told you. About Bill, you mean?
All of it. About him, an' you an' Uncle Pete... about robbin' the Rock Island Pacific... an' about them Missouri Banks.

## He's gonna die, ain't he?
Maybe.

## Well, suppose he does?
We'll bury him.

## You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?
I can't spot 'em myself but you could. That red-haired one, you could spot a half-mile off, I bet.

## Just like that?
I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before. I'm more killer than him.

## Yeah?
Hell, yeah.

## I've been looking all over for you. You still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor?
Yeah.

## What was the money for?
Bear with me here...

## Edie, please. I don't want to hear this right now. What did Renault and Fortier say?
They want more time to think about investing.

## Dean, I love you. Do you hear me?
Come home, Dean.

## I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
A glass of water would be nice.

## So what is it you do, Mr. Kint?
Umm ...

## A hijacker like Dean, here? Or something more creative?
I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.

## So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight?
I had a guy's fingers in my asshole tonight.

## I don't know. Who was that guy that used to talk about Soze in New York?
Yeah. He said he did jobs for him. Indirect stuff. Always five times more money than the job was worth.

## We all go. How about it, Keaton?
DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS.

## The word I got is you hung up your spurs, man. What's that all about?
He's alright.

## How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?
Keaton, we gotta go. They're gonna find him.

## Can we stealth these guys?
I know you. You don't think I know you're on the take. This whole fucking precinct is dirty. You don't have a fucking leg to stand on.

## What are we gonna do?
I can run. I got no problem with that.

## Did you hear what he just said?
If I'm going in, I want a stake.

## You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?
I walked. Ninety days, suspended.

## They - That's bullshit. They don't operate anymore.
How do you do?

## What fence? Who?
Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot.

## What's with you? What do you care whether I come or not?
They - They don't know me. You do. They won't take me unless you go. Look at me. I need this.

## Don't tell me you don't need this. Is this your place?
You watch your mouth.

## You okay?
I'11 be alright.

## How are they going to do it?
McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.

## Three million?
Maybe more.

## No killing?
Not if we do it my way.

## What-are they speaking?
Russian, I think. I don't know.

## Just do what I tell you.
Hungarian?

## How are you, Keaton?
I'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser.

## This I had to see myself.
Ready?

## with what?
You know damn well, dead-man.

## Who's your boss?
My employer wishes to remain anonymous.

## What about Redfoot?
The answer is no.

## What did you say?
No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus.

## Business or personal?
A little of both.

## Who is he?
Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.

## Did they charge him with anything?
Weapons. Misdemeanor two.

## When does he post bail?
Two hours, tops.

## Where?
I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.

## What?
Nothing. Something I - forget it.

## If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?
And I am sure you have a host of wild + theories to answer these questions.

## You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?
I just want to hear your story.

## You know Ruby is in Attica?
He didn't have my lawyer.

## What lawyer?
The D.A. gave me immunity.

## Is he the one that killed Keaton?
No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.

## Do you believe in him, Verbal?
Keaton always said, I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him. Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser SOZE.

## You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?
Turn state's evidence. Take the stand on this and we'll hear it out.

## I've got immunity now. What can you possibly offer me?
If there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you.

## Can we just get back to Kobayashi?
You're stalling, Verbal.

## Then what?
McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.

## What call?
Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.

## I don't understand what you're saying. I saw Keaton get shot, I swear to you.
Why didn't you say anything?

## Then why didn't you help him?
I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.

## It was Keyser Soze, Agent Kujan. I mean the Devil himself. How do you shoot the Devil in the back?
I never heard of him.

## But how - wait. You're saying SOZE sent t us to kill someone?
He wanted me to live.

## I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?
Because he was my friend.

## You think he's..?
I'm not bait. No way. I post today.

## Counselor, you're bluffing. Shall I push for misdemeanor two?
Mr. Abraham...

## Abrams. Yes. How are you today?
I'm fine.

## Good. You ever been inside a hospital?
Yes.

## Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.

## What did he find?
Nothing.

## How good's your intelligence?
Very good.

## And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
As far as we know, nothing.

## If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
Well, of course, it's always dangerous ...

## I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
Yes.

## How did you settle on the amount?
We thought it was just.

## What are you doing here?
It looks that way.

## You know what that would mean? To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
... a Mrs. Doneghy called ... I told you that.

## What does it mean?
They want to settle. It means a lot of money.

## Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
No, actually, she was referred to me. She was Dr. Hagman's patient...

## You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby. Were you not?
Yes.

## Anything special about the case?
When she...

## Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr.Marx, of course...

## What did these people do when her heart stopped?
We went to Code Blue...

## Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
Well, many reasons, actually...

## Tell me one?
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...

## ...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear. Isn't that what you did?
My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know...

## ...to get her heartbeat back...?
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...

## Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye. Is that correct?
That is correct. I was engaged to render an opinion.

## Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today?
Just as you are, Sir...

## Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...

## ...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine?
No.

## Neurology?
No.

## Orthopedics?
I'm just an M.D.

## Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
I know of him.

## How is that?
Through, through his book.

## What book is that?
Meth...Methodology and Technique...

## ...of Anesthesiology?
Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.

## How old are you?
I am seventy-four years old.

## Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of medicine?
I'm on the staff of...

## Mr. Concannon...?
Nothing further, your Honor.

## Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
Objection! This is ri...expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...

## You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
It's a crime.

## You would not...?
No.

## In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right?
Yes.

## ...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
Yes.

## They lied.' Indeed! When did they lie? And do you know what a lie is?
I do. Yes.

## You didn't write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
Because I kept a copy. I have it right here.

## And why, please tell us, would you think that?
... that's all right.

## You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up. Who do you think you are? Who do you think you are...?
Hold on a second.

## I'm going to have you disbarred. I'm going to have your ticket. You know what you did? Do you know what you did?
It's all right, Mickey.

## Why is that?
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance...she...

## Is that what a good doctor would do? How old are you, please?
I am seventy-four years old.

## What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
I am on the staff of...

## She getting good care over there?
Actually, yes. It's by no means bad, I...

## Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.

## Dr. Thompson...?
It was good of you to meet...

## Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
It's my opinion it took him much longer. Nine...ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.

## I'm afraid that's not true. Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home.

## Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.' General textbook on the subject. Is that correct?
I. Yes. It is.

## That's perfectly all right. I'm kind of rushed. Do you mind if we walk while we talk?
I read the hospital report on your client.

## Right. Who called?
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle ... her estate ...

## ... and you're going to do that?
Yes.

## You're going to settle out of court?
Yes.

## Why?
Her doctors killed her.

## ) I'm sorry ...?
Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anaesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life. Her doctors murdered her.

## Do you know who her doctors were?
I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.

## Okay. I'll meet you here. Tuesday night ... I gotta go. You going my way?
We have to ... we ... we have to keep you under wraps. Please don't, don't discuss ...

## To do right. Isn't that why you're doing it?
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.

## ...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no question of that. It's just a matter of how big...

## Then why aren't you testifying for their side?
I can subpoena you, you know. I can get you up there on the stand.

## And ask me what?
Who put my client in the hospital for life.

## I do. Who is it? The Doctors. What do you owe them?
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.

## Then why don't you testify?
You know, you're pushy, fella...

## Why is that?
I was held up.

## What is it?
Thank you for seeing me.

## Is the Plaintiff ready?
Ready, your Honor.

## Defense...?
Do we have time this morning to... All right. Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.

## Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue. Dr. Thompson. Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
Sustained. Yes. The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.

## Yes, Mr. Galvin?
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...

## Are you done?
Nothing further, your Honor...

## Mr. Concannon...?
I object, your Honor...

## I have to reach him. This is an emergency. Could you give me his home number?
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...

Yes. Price...

## Pardon?

## D'you find an apartment?
Still looking.

## I changed my life today. What did you do?
I changed my room at the Hotel.

## Why?
The TV didn't work.

## And what are you? A cop?
I'm a lawyer.

## Who says I'm the one that called it off?
Laura.

## What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
You just got lucky. D'you eat yet? Come on.

## The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth? You want another drink?
I think I will.

## Maybe what?
Maybe I can do something right.

## And is that what you're going to do? Is that what you're going to do...?
That's what I'm going to try to do.

## What...?
Is this a bad time.

## What happened...?
They, uh, they got to my witness.

## ...and is that serious?
I've got to work...

## Do you want me to go...?
No, no, I'm just...

## Why don't you get some rest?
I've got to work.

## You're going to stay here...?
Yes.

## Do you think it's my fault?
Isn't there something you...

## And it's over...?
Yes.

## You do what you want. You want to leave...You want to go kill yourself?
I...

## Who told you that?
You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.

## And what makes you so tough?
Maybe I'll tell you later.

## Is there going to be a later...?
Not if you don't grow up...

## What is that to you...?
What would you like it to be to me...? I, I, I can't invest in failure.

## Is it over?
No.

## What are you going to do?
I don't have a goddamned idea.

## Where is he?
I...please. My wife...my wife's prescription has run out. If I can call him...

## What the hell do you think you're doing ...? What's going on here ...?
Uh ...

## ... now who is that ...?
... You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them ...

## Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
One lousy letter eighteen months ago... .I try to throw a fuckin' case your way ...

## What do you want?
Come on. Let's get a drink.

## Are you out of your mind...?
...I'm going to need your help...

## ...I have to stand up for her...
What?

## Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
I'm going to get laid.

## I'm getting it back. Don't worry about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find the obstetric nurse?
Mary Rooney. She won't talk to me. I tried her at the hospital. I'm going to try her back at home. Read this.

## John, gimme a cuesta-ray.
So what?

## I've got to go see Gruber. What's the best cigars you have?
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.

## What happened, Joey...?
I can't talk now.

## D'you find the obstetric nurse?
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital. She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...

## How are you holding up?
I'm swell.

## Okay. What do you do when you don't have a witness?
You use their witness.

## Are you with me...are you awake...?
Yeah. I'm awake.

## Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
Who? They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.

## All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?
What difference can that make...? All right...

## The 'History'...?
How old are you, how many children ... when did you last eat ...

## We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
The broad has disappeared...

## The Hospital...?
...yeah...good...

## What the hell are you doing here?
We got to talk.

## What are you doing in New York...?
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...

## We got a mistrial, you know. Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
I don't want a mistrial.

## I'm ... Mrs. Doneghy? I'm Frank Galvin ... why didn't you go in?
It's locked.

## It's locked?
... we, we love her, Dick and me ...

## ... You saw her?
Yes. Yes, I have.

## ... fifty thousand dollars?
I don't want to leave her. Dick ...the, the ... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will ...

## She did?
I just saw her.

## Hi. How are you doing?
I've been meaning to come in a long time.

## You live in the neighborhood?
Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.

## How old is he?
Four. You're great with these kids.

## Who told you that?
Mrs...

## That's a wonderful profession. My daughter-in-law's a nurse. What did you do, stop?
Kathy Price...

## These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
Kathy Costello. That's my maiden name.

## D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
Yes.

## What did she say?
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.

## And did you write the numeral `one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
I did.

## Another, Frank ... ?
I want to buy you a drink.

## Well, well, well. Huh?
Yeah.

## What happened in those three minutes...?
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...

## Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
Yes.

## Huh. And why is that?
Because she was anemic. It's right there on her chart. Her brain was getting less oxygen anyway...

## Should I?
Yes.

## The Big Boy did...?
Huh.

## Doctor, how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this?
It is hard to say. Six months, at least. Perhaps a year. It depends to a certain extent on him.

## How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
I married into it.

## How long have you been back?
Almost a year.

## Shouldn't you be sitting down?
No, I'm all right.

## Would you like a drink now?
Not what you think. We're very happily married.

## Then?
I'm afraid some harm may come to her.

## From whom?
Someone dead.

## Scottie, do you believe that someone out of the past, someone dead, can enter and take possession of a living being?
No.

## If I told you I believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say?
Then you're of no use to me. I'm sorry I wasted your time. Thank you for coming in, Scottie.

## No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you're still the hard-headed Scot, aren't you? Always were. Do you think I'm making it up?
No.

## How often does this happen?
More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day.

## We're going to an opening at the opera tonight. We'll dine at Ernie's first. Which is easier?
Ernie's.

## Carlotta Valdes was what, your wife's grandmother?
Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.

## Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?
Nothing.

## How do you know all these things she doesn't know?
Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.

## Why did she never tell her daughter?
Natural fear. Her grandmother went insane and took her own life. And the blood is in Madeleine. Scottie, I ask you to watch her closely.

## What happened?
She... went into the Bay.

## Did she hurt herself?
No. She's in fine shape. Nothing to worry about. But she doesn't know. You understand that. She doesn't know what she did.

## Just let me talk to you.
Could I ask you a couple of questions?

## What about?
You.

## Well... you don't look very much like Jack the Ripper...
Why?

## About three years.
What do you want to know?

## Listen, what is this? What do you want?
I want to know who you are.

## Why?
Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...

## Dinner... and what else?
Just dinner.

## Because I remind you of her?
Mmm.

## Don't go.
Can I see you tomorrow?

## And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
I'll take care of you.

## As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd \"take care of me\"?
Yes.

## Will you, Judy?
I suppose I could phone the store in the morning, and say I'm sick.

## Okay. Now we're going to buy you some clothes.
No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?

## Honest?
There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.

## Scottie, what are you doing?
I'm trying to buy you a suit.

## You want me to dress like her?
I wish you'd leave me alone. I want to go away.

## Well?
It should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck. I told them. I told you.

## Where shall we go for dinner?
Wherever you'd like...

## Mmmm.
Ernie's?

## Is that the best you can do?
Come here.

## I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather go somewhere else?
Oh, yeah. There.

## I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
No, it's all right.

## Where are you going?
To complete my cure.

## Scottie, why are we here?
I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.

## But why? Why here?
Madeleine died here.

## Why?
Dead. He'd broken her neck.

## Your accident...
I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --

## I don't know... Switzerland?
We'll find him.

## What are you going to do?
Look at the scene of the crime. Go on in.

## What are you going to do?
I loved you, Madeleine.

## Why am I here? What happened?
You... ...fell into the Bay.

## Where were you?
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset. Ah... thank you for the fire.

## When?
This afternoon.

## Before? Where? Where had you been?
Please drink your coffee.

## You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
Wandering about.

## You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?
Yes, I knew which one it was. It's out there, now. But I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way.

## I prefer John. There, that's done. And what do you do, John?
Wander about.

## That's a good occupation. And live here... alone?
One shouldn't live alone.

## ...Falling... into San Francisco Bay?
No... this is the first time for me, too.

## I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
You've nothing to apologize for.

## I hope we will, too.
Would you like some coffee?

## What?
Meet again, sometime.

## Shopping?
No.

## Well... anywhere in particular?
No, I Just thought I'd wander.

## Oh, yes, I forgot, It's your occupation, isn't it?
Don't you think it's sort of a waste for the two of us to...

## How can you be sure?
If I've been there? That's silly! Either you've been to a place or you haven't.

## How old?
Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.

## What are you thinking?
Of all the people who have been born... and have died... while the trees went on living.

## Why?
Knowing I have to die...

## Do you hear anything?
Only silence. It's always like this.

## Would you like a drink of water?
Here with you.

## Where?
The tall trees...

## Have you been here before?
Yes...

## Where were you born?
Long ago...

## Home?
...somewhere in the light.

## And you'll go on saving me? Again and again?
Yesterday.

## What do you remember?
A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...

## Would you know the room?
No... it's in shadow.

## What else?
A grave...

## Where?
I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.

## How do you know?
I know.

## A portrait? Do you ever see a portrait?
No.

## If I could find the key... find the beginning put it together...
Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?

## I should have phoned... but I wanted to see you... be with you...
And so explain it away? But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?

## Why? What's happened?
I had the dream. The dream came back again...

## Where's your husband?
I didn't wake him. I don't want him to know...

## It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?
Here with you.

## Why?
Let me go.

## Where?
Yes.

## Is there something I can do for you?
Valdes. Miss Valdes. It's Spanish, you know.

## Carlotta Valdes?
Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it? Foreign. But sweet.

## How long has she had the room?
Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.

## Would you please go and look?
In her room? Well, yes, of course if you ask. But it does seem silly...

## Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?
More than you think.

## What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
You sound so disapproving, Midge.

## Why?
I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.

## And sit behind a desk? Chairborne?
It's where you belong.

## Well?... what'll you do?
Nothing for a while. You forget, I'm a man of independent means. Or fairly independent.

## Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.

## Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
I'm having one now.

## How's your love life, Midge?
That's following a train of thought.

## Well?
Normal.

## Aren't you ever going to get married?
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.

## Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
Three whole weeks.

## That's Skid Row... isn't it?
Could be.

## Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
What.

## I've got a theory. Look. If I can get used to heights just a little at a time... progressively see?
Yeah.

## Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?
Who shot who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.

## Do you know him well?
Pop Leibel? Sure.

## All right, come on. Introduce me. Where is your hat?
The poor thing....

## I've told you enough.
For what?

## Who's the guy, who's the wife?
Just wander.

## Where?
Around.

## Oh?
Mm. Better.

## Did you need it?
Yeah.

## What was this desperate urge to see me?
All I said in the note was, \"Where are you?\" That doesn't sound desperate to me.

## Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
Oh... this and that.

## What I've been doing?
If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.

## What have you been doing?
Wandering.

## No, not exactly. Want to see?
As a matter of fact, I thought I might give it to you.

## Oh?
Yes... the Beautiful Carlotta... the Sad Carlotta...

## What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?
It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.

## By whom?
She died.

## How?
By her own hand. There are many such stories.

## How soon can it be altered?
Well...

## Can we have it by tonight?
We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car.

## I said how's it going?
I didn't hear you.

## Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed?
Boyd brought up divorce statistics.

## Oh, and why am I an asshole?
Multiple reasons.

## Why?
It's sacrilegious.

## What did you say?
You're not a team player.

## What are you fucking talking about?
Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us.

## You want to hear me out?
I'm calling the ambulance.

## Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing?
Calling the ambulance.

## Why? Why? She's dead. Why are you calling an ambulance?
We have to call the ambulance.

## Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?
Her head's bashed in and her heart isn't beating.

## We can do this. We can get her out of here.
Are you sure this was an accident?

## You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.

## What about the blood?
Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.

## Have you ever done this before?
Sun rises at 5,52.

## What?
We can't do this.

## How do you figure?
So that's what we're doing.

## Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
I can't do this.

## What?
At the seven-eleven.

## I got children. I've got a life.
Who? What are you talking about?

## All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right?
No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all.

## What?
They're screaming for Starbursts.

## That's one idea.
Where's the candy?

## No...we want padded chairs...okay?
Real times.

## Are you solid with that?
No. I think it's fucked.

## Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
I got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull, Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack...

## Where's the bathroom?
My god.

## Money?
Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.

## What does that mean?
Well, oh...

## So where's that leave us?
So. When is the wedding.

## What are you talking about?
Don't sweet lip me.

## Micheal? Do you have something to tell me?
Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...

## Shut up Boyd! Micheal?
He's upset about Adam. We're all upset.

## I'm with Tina. Is she there?
She's not here.

## Where is she?
She's here. She's just...Hold on a second.

## The groom?
Yup.

## Doing the bachelor party thing?
That's right.

## Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day. Where's Tina?
She's in the bathroom...she's still working.

## She's still working?
That's right.

## Is everything okay?
Great. Fine. Perfect.

## Fish?
Your investment ideas never work out.

## Where do you look? What side of the neck?
Left side.

## What is her disposition?
He just had two.

## Who's up for making some real money?
Not really. Yes, the Fisher wedding chairs...

## What kind of words?
Fisher had a less than normal relationship with that Donkey.

## No easy Boyd! I got a best friend in there in pieces. How about a little sensitivity?
He's cracked up.

## Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?
I don't know! I just want to get married.

## What?
What you just said. Say it again.

## Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?
No, but she's definitely pissed and hostile. And she's clearly starting to think that's something's not right.

## What are you going to do?
Take care of business.

## And what does that mean? Are you insane?! You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?
I don't know...

## I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there?
Yeah.

## Hear what?
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.

## Now?
That's right.

## Hold on a sec. Lois, you sure you wouldn't rather do this in the morning?
This is a situation that defies judgement. We have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most.

## My what?
You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.

## Okay fine.
You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?

## Fine? Fine what?
Whatever you say Kojak.

## Moore?
Your ideas never work out.

## Oh really? Starbucks?
I don't hate women.

## And what happens when you can't?
New king.

## If I'm the king of Israel, I say to myself, King, I say to myself, King... Take a good look around. What do I see?
Israel doesn't have a King.

## Then what do they have?
They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something.

## What's your point?
The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies.

## What? What's your point?
Take Mexico.

## What?
The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction.

## The need to know is clear. What did Adam tell Lois? That's the name of the game. What did Adam tell Lois? What does Lois know?
Ball park sausages.

## You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want?
Easy Micheal.

## Come on tough guy. Listen to me. You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me?
I love you.

## Are we supposed to?
It's not a question of supposed to, it's an entirely personal decision... Some do some don't.

## The rings?
I do.

## Why can't we do it through the mail?
We missed the deadline.

## Can't we do it on the phone?
I don't think so.

## Why is this Kid staring at me?
I'm not sure.

## Did you send in all of the deposit checks?
I think so.

## What do you mean, you think so?
I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are.

## The wedding cake check?
Sent it.

## Photographer?
Sent it.

## Florist?
Yup.

## Caterer?
Yes.

## You forgot the tent?
I think so.

## Why did you forget the tent check?
I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.

## How could I know what else I forgot?
I'm working my ass off here. I've taken care of absolutely everything Keith.

## What?
Don't you put this on me. Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, don't...

## Are we going to do this again?
I'm just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes.

## Right before the wedding?
It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding.

## What are you talking about?
I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself.

## Who else?
Charles Moore for instants.

## What does Moore have to do with your growing?
I just don't see him in the big picture.

## Why? What's his problem?
He's a great chef.

## You expect more what?
Of course.

## How much?
With all my heart.

## Kiss me...?
We've got problems here.

## Problems?
Seating problems.

## I'm not. What's the problem?
We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.

## What kind of seats can we have?
Not padded ones.

## So what do we do?
You go down there.

## Go down where?
Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.

## Do you love me?
More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever.

## Will you please call the chair people?
I will.

## Do you love me?
Of course.

## Hi. Are you calling from jail?
Not yet.

## Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation?
I'm working on it, I've made three calls. I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.

## What are you doing?
Just a bit of organizing.

## Nesting?
Yeah. Nesting.

## Where are you?
We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.

## How late?
No. Just like an hour or so.

## What about the chairs?
Okay.

## I left a message. I think it's going to be okay.
What okay?

## You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
No. No. I'll see you in about four hours.

## What's the word on the chairs?
I'm working on it.

## Well, can you come back inside?
Yeah. Sure.

## Now?
Yeah. Look honey, I'll be right in. I just...we're just taking care of some Groomsmen last minute business.

## Are they fighting?
No baby. We'll all be right in.

## Can we just talk this out?
Talk what out? We are locked and loaded here. We are non-refundable. I've got relatives on the airport right now! I've got...

## Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
Yeah. You.

## What kind of stupid question is that?
Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...

## What are you talking about?
Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.

## Who's dead?
The prostitute.

## You fucked a prostitute?
No Micheal did. It was an accident.

## My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she?
She's in the desert. She's out in the desert.

## You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone?
He kept saying he was protected.

## What does that mean?
Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.

## Like how?
The only proof is those bodies.

## So what do we do?
Move the bodies.

## Move the bodies?
You and Moore move the bodies and bury Boyd with them. In fact, put Moore in the ground too.

## What?
Yeah, Dad. It's great.

## What does that mean?
It means she's insecure.

## About what?
I just want her to be happy.

## You're not breathing right?
Lately I'll just start getting lightheaded, dizzy, and I realize I haven't breathed in like two minutes.

## So?
I'll take a ride.

## Where did you get that?
At the newsstand on 3rd.

## Buzzing?
Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull.

## The wahoo moment?
I think so.

## What is it?
Well if you do think about names... Micheal's a pretty good one...It's done me all right.

## What?
I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter.

## Did she believe you?
I have no idea.

## A move?
Greenpeace.

## Greenpeace?
Maybe go up to the North Pole, the Arctic. Tag polar bears with dart guns. I've always had a pretty good aim...

## Where's Boyd?
Downstairs in the closet.

## Did he try to kiss you?
All week long.

## You alright?
There.

## Yeah?
I think there's a lot of truth in that. I'm gonna pursue some options. I want to join that Big Brother thing.

## I want a black one. A little black brother. That's a big problem it seems to me. Lack of racial integration. That's a big one. You think?
I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.

## Okay great. What will that be?
We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic.

## You know, Darling you...you send me...Darling you ...You mend me. Honey, sing it for Judge Tower.
What song?

## Liz do you take Fisher to be your beloved husband, to respect, honor and cherish him till death do you part?
I do.

## So where to on the honeymoon?
Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big picture, take your time. I wish I had.

## Didn't you say you know how to make vanilla pudding?
Yes, yes.

## Where's the camera?
It's a present from my parents.

## So much the better. We'll all fit. How many floors are there?
Two.

## Are there many windows?
Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.

## What's that?
Enedina and Paco ...

## What about them?
They're playing games behind the couch ...

## Which couch?
That one.

## I'm well ... The bus was late, wasn't it? ... What was the journey like?
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.

## How long are you staying?
A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.

## Was that difficult to get?
No. Mother Superior told me to come.

## Did you have so little interest in seeing me?
You have no feelings toward ...

## Who is she?
My maid Ramona's daughter. She's a little animal.

## What do you mean?
Nothing. I didn't say anything.

## Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?
Yes, it is.

## Don't you ever see him?
Never.

## How could anybody behave like that?
Sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. Sometimes it's because of...

## Wasn't that cowardice?
Uncle, you mustn't think that I won't be sad to leave you.

## Then you won't forgive me?
Leave me now. You can go to bed.

## Why don't you ask her to stay on for a few days?
I have asked her but she's ungrateful. Sometimes I feel like hitting her. When I talk to her about the convent, she turns to stone.

## Sit down, woman, sit down. You like me, don't you?
I'd be really ungrateful, if I didn't like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn.

## Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?
Just say the word, sir, and I'll do anything.

## But sir, what can I say to her? And why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her?
Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.

## But what can I say to her, sir?
Tell her I lied, that I didn't take advantage of her.

## You believe me, don't you?
Yes, sir.

## What will the lady say?
She won't even know.

## Is it all right?
Yes.

## How much is that?
Fifteen yards.

## That's fifteen by seven?
That's it.

## Have you thought of what you want planted yet?
The fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.

## And in the vegetable plot?
That's good land.

## No, sir, it's nearly six o'clock. Okay, let's get a move on! When are you leaving?
Tonight, but I'll be back tomorrow afternoon.

## Me?
Come on, miss. Just so the Virgin can be really pretty.

## Do you have great devotion for the Virgin?
It's very good.

## Why do you say that? Perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous.
But why? Why?

## What's the matter with you?
Nothing.

## Why the bad temper?
It's Viridiana. She's getting on my nerves.

## What are you going to do?
What I do every day, but I want to do it earlier.

## What are you thinking about?
That your cousin is more to your taste.

## How in hell does it wind up?
I think I'd better go tomorrow.

## That's life. Some people are brought together, others are separated. What can we do, if that's the way it happens?
Maybe afterwards he'll let me ...

## He was very good. Better than some people would think.
Where's the dough?

## Why did he kill himself?
I don't know, sir.

## And this chest?
There are some curtains and drapes, but they're all very old.

## Why?
You wouldn't be here otherwise.

## Are you Jorge?
Jorge, Don Jaime's son, at your service.

## Well... is it so urgent?
I don't know anything about these things, Jorge ...

## What do you know about me?
I know that you used to work with an architect.

## Do they worry you that much, then?
They worry me a great deal, and especially because of you.

## Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day.

## Are they going to work here too?
Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you.

## Yes. Why?
You can come and live again in the big house if you want. Now that I'm alone, I can settle down anywhere.

## And ...your friend?
She's left.

## Is she coming back?
No.

## Then let him go and he'll follow you.
Why?

## And let him get run over by somebody else?
He's good at rabbiting and he knows it. When we're in the country, if he doesn't hunt he doesn't get fed.

## How much do you want for him?
I wasn't thinking of selling him, but if you want ... I'll leave it to you.

## They're varicose veins, miss, but some days I can't take care of them.
What's he called?

## Are you sure it isn't contagious?
Things seem to be getting better.

## Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
You cannot leave ...

## Why not?
There's been an accident.

## Where?
Come with me.

## Why are you crying?
I'm afraid.

## He couldn't get through the door, then?
He came in through the cupboard.

## Have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?
They shut all right now. And the blankets are ready.

## What's going on, Moncho?
I've just had a letter from your uncle. He won't be able to come when you take your vows.

## He has paid for your studies and your maintenance, and he has just sent your dowry. Does that mean so little to you, Viridiana?
I have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...

## Good morning. You weren't expecting me, were you?
Mother.

## Are you aware of the pride there is in what you're saying?
Forgive me if I have offended you.

## Give the little girl to me. Come here, sweetheart. Are you ready?
When you are, miss.

## Would you mind telling me what I did wrong to you to deserve your insults?
I've had a gutful of this.

## What about you, Manuel?
I'm only good at making people laugh.

## How do you feel?
I have a headache.

## What happened to me?
You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here.

## Have I slept long?
Oh, you slept well; don't worry.

## Good morning, Rita. How are we today?
Today, a good girl.

## How did you see me?
From the terrace.

## I'm going to the hen house. Are you coming with me?
No, I don't want to.

## Can you tell us what's on the disc?
In English, please.

## Me? What did I do?
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.

## Why wasn't I told?
We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made himself into an android.

## Recognize this? How would you like your old job back?
Catch him and your record's clean.

## Yes or no, Mr. Barnes?
There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you.

## What are they doing in Los Feliz?
Madison lives two blocks from their present location.

## Why would they be going there?
I don't know.

## He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?
Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter? I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards.

## What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for?
He was a computer program for crissake.

## Real, my ass. It's an overblown game. Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?
I'm getting by.

## What about them?
Do me a favor  keep sending them.

## These were taken inside LETAC an hour ago. Pretty pictures, aren't they?
I've seen worse.

## Jesus Christ. Can you kill it?
If you can catch him.

## Fine  you want to stay here?
Officers in Toluca Lake just found an affluent couple...completely gutted. So were the first two cops to arrive on scene.

## Their weapons missing?
Sid 6.7 is now armed.

## Where's my gun?
Don't worry, they have no idea where you are.

## You sonofabitch. How could you let them put the implant in my head? How?
She saved your life, Parker. She didn't have to, but she did.

## When this is over, will you get this goddam thing out of my head?
On my life, I promise you I will.

## Any sign of Lindenmeyer?
Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.

## You think he's smart?
Captain, I'm afraid of how smart Sid 6.7 is. But I'm even more afraid of what's he's becoming.

## I don't set policy. You have the key?
Give me 30 seconds, then flip every switch you can reach.

## What's the assignment?
You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field.

## That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter?
Not if you're with him every step of the way.

## Think you can do it?
Not from in here.

## What happens if I can't catch him?
If Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you, we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence.

## What did you find out?
Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.

## No, but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target. How much C-4 is missing?
Enough to level an entire city block.

## You know how much man power you're talking about?
You're the highest law enforcement official in the country. Use the fucking army if you need to.

## Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?
Don't forget, convict, if this psycho isn't stopped, you go right back to rotting in a prison cell.

## Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?
Don't remind me.

## What the hell happened?
I was assured the problem was corrected.

## How does he know who I am?
He hears...everything.

## Do I get to see it or not?
Bastard... Sheila, don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.

## How do you kill it?
Separate the character module from the neural net...

## How should I know?
Show me his physical sensory level.

## Should I have?
Think hard -- it'll come to you...

## My God...
It was you, wasn't it?

## What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?
She's some of your finest work, Daryl.

## You catching my drift?
Of course you are.

## How can I ever thankyou for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl?
Help me get out of here.

## Don't worry. Through me, you will live forever...
You made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived. What do you think I'm doing?

## No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you. How you feeling today?
A little less than yesterday.

## In other words, par for the course. How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday?
John died.

## What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.

## You all right?
Fine. Never felt better in my life. See, I'm a good liar.

## You ready for this?
Don't worry. If I can't handle it, I'll just kill everybody.

## What happened when he was 17?
Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers. Stay here.

## You've got a problem with me carrying a gun?
Do me one favor  if you shoot at anything, make sure I'm nowhere near it.

## You've studied me, now I'm studying you. Seems only fair, don't you think?
This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work.

## I've been in prison, remember?
The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.

## Hamlet. What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a composite.

## Remember the bowling ball bag Sid carried with him in virtual reality?
What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the sonof-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.

## Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?
I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.

## She's beautiful, you know?
Thank-you. Her name is Karin.

## Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?
I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.

## You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it. Where to?
Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.

## What does that mean?
Sounds to me like a welleducated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.

## Don't worry about it, all right?
Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...

## Then why don't you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while?
Don't get out of the car.

## What did you do to those people?
Nothing.

## Enjoying yourself?
You know I am.

## Whatever he was doing here was only the start.
What's the problem?

## Start of what?
I don't know, yet. What we do know is his performances are increasing in scale, not decreasing. Whatever it is, he isn't finished...

## You like baseball?
Real effective security...

## You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?
Authority still makes me nervous.

## Which way?
Both.

## How did you find out about the toxin?
Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.

## I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?
I was wrong. And I was wrong not to tell you Grimes was part of Sid. I should have told you. I won't make the same mistake again.

## The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?
I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.

## Think he's keeping track of his creation?
That, or living through him...

## See something?
I'm not sure...on the bridge...the guy at the payphone...

## Find out anything?
A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where.

## You don't know?
That's why I'm asking.

## ...I think so...You?
More or less.

## Lindenmeyer?
My guess is dead.

## Sid?
I don't know.

## Where the hell are you going?
Lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had...

## How's your pulse?
You won't want to watch. Turn around.

## Performing solo. Enjoying the concert so far?
The symphony of collision...

## DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.

## I thought you liked me being in the audience. Don't you want me to see it?
There you go  best seat in the house.

## Aren't you going to watch with me?
I've got some final preparations to take care of Checking his watch, he stops suddenly.

## Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow.
What are you talking about?

## At this stage, you either get form or function. You said she wanted function. I gave you function. What are you complaining about?
You want some research, flu? Side-effects of medi....

## What if he's busy tonight?
Lure him.

## What about it?
For Schumann.

## You wouldn't be here if it wasn't true. It's true, right?
Alright, well, alright, geopolitically...

## NY Times, Washington Post, War, War, War. Times got the girlscout page twelve, Post in Section Two.... Horses in Mid-Stream...?

## ...mmm?
It's the gratitude of your party...

## He, uh, has he been in the \"jail\" long?
...twelve years.

## And? NO. I don't wanna know. What do you mean \"and...\"?
Look, look, look.... He's fine, as long as he has his medication.

## What happens if he doesn't have his medication?
He's not fine.

## ...where?
Come on.

## ...how do we Explain That? Hey? Am I worried...?
...how do we explain that? With the World Watching.

## But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
How do we explain that? Ah, well, you see, Wilfred, this is where you've never been at a pitch required of....

## What rig?
...the Harvester...

## What are you talking about?
You're not thinking right, Pal...

## Who we got here...?
John Levy, Staff, and Amy Cain, Press Off....

## Okay. And she's alleging...?
We are virtually certain it isn't...

## What difference does it make if it's true? It's a story with it -- How long've we got til it breaks?
Front page. Washington Post. Tomorrow.

## When do we bring'em back?
We're going to have to explain away the...

## What crisis?

## And you?
It won't hold.

## What in the world would do that?

## What is it?
It's the rough-cut, the other side's new commercial.

## ....we landing?
Tell me again.

## What's it gonna cost?
But, but, but, \"they\" would find out.

## Who would find out?

Why not...

## ...they sound what?
Shifty em...

## Who?
Well, I'm working on it....

## What do you know about them?
...nothing...

## What did Albania ever do to us?
What did they ever do for us...? You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber.

## ...where is the Back End coming from?
It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...

## The hostages, but that was a naturally-occuring... It was a put-up job? But where was the, where was the money in that?
In the yellow ribbon.

## Hello... Yes. We'll be back...?

To preserve their Way of Life.

## S'only when you fuck up, everything gets full of shit. Do you think we could line him up for the Peace Prize?
Hey, our job ends at the Finish Line.

## Just for the Symmetry of the thing...?

With their berets...

## Someone's bringing in a kitten...?
No, no, no.... we'll punch in.

## A wider option of what?
...of kittens...

## What the fuck did you mean, \"What kind of stuff?\"?
...this is nothing. This is nothing. D'you ever shoot in Italy? Try three Italian starlets on Benzedrine, this is a walk in the park...

## ...where's my l'il pill?
Show some compassion.

## Is today Laundry Day...?
Yup.

## How 'bout a Cold Drink...?
Oh, hell...

## What about tipping off Yurovich?
Sell it all. What the hell, so I'll only make ten million.

## Sounds like a french word, what is it?
It's a romantic and tragic drink.

## Give me that phone. Yes, sir, this is the manager. What seems to be the problem?
He's lying.

## Nice piece of work, Fox. Why don't you join me and the partners for lunch tomorrow in the dining room?
I'd love to, Mr. Lynch, thank you.

## ...still looking for the right 18 year old wife, how you doing, pal?
...if I had your looks, better.

## Buddy boy, how ya doing?
Great Charlie, any better it'd be a sin.

## Wanna play some tennis Saturday?
You mean teach you how to play. Can't. Going fly fishing in Canada, big client...

## ...you take that Anacott Steel?
...light snack, but good, thanks pal, you're sharking your way up...

## Joke about it. I was up all night charting these stocks. You want to see this or what?
Thanks, Marv, with that I might be able to qualify for welfare.

## It concerns his future!
It concerns his future!

## ...well, see him?
Yeah, but he didn't see me.

## ...got tickets for the Knicks tonight. Go out and cruise some bimbos afterwards, whaddaya say?
...gotta read my reports.

## Hey Marv, he demanded confidentiality...
Got a little action there, eh buddy?

## What's going on?
Lynch is giving him the boot... He's not pulling his quota.

## Didn't I tell you to knock before you came in here?
Hey the door was open.

## You get on the phone and ask strangers for their money, right? You're a salesman.
Sell?

## It's yourself you've got to be proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya need?
Can you spare three hundred? Pay you back next month, promise.

## ...Work okay?
That's great Dad.

## About what?
The FAA announcement.

## Goddamn fare wars are murdering us. Had to lay off five guys. Nothing I could do. What is it... money?
Dividend. I figure I owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes...

## ... Dad, you should've been a CEO. How about dinner?
Whatever night you like.

## ...gotta run Dad. You stop smoking, you hear?
Your words, not mine...

## Another cup of coffee?
No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.

## What are you doing here?
...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.

## First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't just come barging in here. And what makes you think it's his birthday?
Stay here, I'll see what I can do.

## What'd you tell him?
I told him I was in the bathroom and I'd call him right back. What the hell was I supposed to say Buddy, you got me into...

## What if he asks where I got the money?
Tell 'em your father gave it to you.

## What if they call him?
They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.

## You sure?
Yes! Read the Constitution, it's all in there. And remember--you don't know anything, nothing.

## Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure. Would you, uh, like to come in?
Didn't he tell you? That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.

## So, where are we going?
Wherever you like, Lutece, 21, the River Cafe...or maybe we can just drive around for a while. Work up an appetite.

## Want some? Gordon tells me you're a very talented broker. What do you like?
Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...

## I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud?
Let's see, it closed at uh, 41 1/8... Up a quarter...very attractive... about average yield...

## So you're hot on this stock?
It's ready to take off. I'd jump all over it if I were you.

## Can't complain. Got a house in Oyster Bay. Market treating you good? Still seeing that sexy French gal?
Nah, she asked the wrong question.

## So, does \"this guy\" have a tip for an honest lawyer?
Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over.

## Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?
Who's listening? It's just one college buddy talking to another.

## More money than you ever dreamed, Roger. And the thing is no one gets hurt...how bout a beer?
Too much to do...but I'll walk you out.

## So what's the problem?
...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...

## Gekko asked us into the Bluestar deal. We're reviewing the timetables, wanna come?
He never told me...

## So you say. Nice to meet you; hope you're intelligent. Like these, how'd you get these?
So what s on your mind kimosabe? Why am I listening to you? Got to monitor my blood pressure, so whatever you do, don't upset me.

## So what firm you with, pal?
Jackson, Steinem...

## ...A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you, the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know?
Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.

## ...rings a bell somewhere. So what?
A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots, flies northeast, Canada, some Florida and Caribbean routes... great slots in major cities...

## How do you know?
My home number's on the back...

## Sure...relax sport, no one's gonna blow a whistle. Here, is this legal?...you wanna put it in my account?
Mr. Gekko -- thank you for the chance. You won't regret this, you're with a winner.

## The most valuable commodity I know of is information. Wouldn't you agree on that?
Yes...

## Know the name?
Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.

## I remember that deal. You were involved?
I don't understand.

## How much?
Close to two million. But this sucker can go all the way to Devon and the nationals.

## What makes you think you can?
I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts.

## I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar. Why?
Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me.

## Why do you need to wreck this company?
Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.

## How much is enough Gordon?
Obviously...

## Are you with me Buddy?
Gordon, it's two minutes to close. What do you want to do?! Decide.

## You sandbagged me on Bluestar. I guess you think you taught the teacher a lesson, that you can make the tail wag the dog, huh?
Hello again, I been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks.

## Stock broker. As in, never have so few done so little for so much. So what do you see in this?
I'd give anything to have this in my house, even for a week.

## Where is it?
Upper West Side.

## What if I have a previous engagement?
Break it.

## You really do believe in destiny?
Only if I want something bad enough.

## Devon? He looks like Seattle Slew. What about the Triple Crown?
He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper.

## So, how did your conference go with Gordon?
The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.

## And what do you want?
...a Turner, a perfect canary diaiaond... a Lear jet... world peace... the best of everything...

## Well, why stop at that?
I don't.

## That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside...
You're not trouble by any chance. Are you?

## Do you think you're ready?
I'll let you know.

## I love you, baby. Did I tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours?
Get in bed. Y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week? You're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein, you love money so much.

## What the hell's that supposed to mean?
You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before...

## Why?
I figure a guy who's made some mistakes should be able to understand a girl who's made some of her own...

## How you doing Buddy?
Great Carolyn, doing any better would be a sin...

## Bud! Where you been the last two days?
...Janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps, urgent...

## Harold, you don't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times, do you?
Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more. If you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen.

## I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?
Fine, if you don't want us, stay with the scum in present management--dedicated to running you and Bluestar into the ground.

## So what's the problem Sunshine? You look like Black Thursday. Bad case of puppy love?
It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.

## You told him about us?
No, are you crazy? And I don't want him ever to know. Do you understand?...

## Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
Because I don't want to see him hurt.

## Rip their throats out and put them in your garbage compactor. Interesting. You got a card?
Rarest pistol in the world, Larry, a .45 Luger. Only six were ever manufactured.

## Are you prepared to put that in writing?
I'll have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days.

## Cards are on the table. What do you think?
Yes, I'm sure. What I need is an older man, something with class, a little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.

## But?
But he still has something Mark hasn't.

## We need to talk. CHINA Yeah about what?
About what? About us.

## Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
Suffer? We're living in America.

## Well if you're in such a rush darling, why don't you lead the way?
Ok toots, I will.

## Hmm.
Weird and tiny huh?

## Good evening sir.
Would you like a closer look?

## Hello, Mrs. Webster. Is China there?
No Jonathan.

## You don't happen to have the address do ya?
Vell. Goodnight.

## What? Tony and China, together?
Wooo. Jealously rearing its ugly head.

## Then why do you still like her?
Like her? I don't know if I ever liked her. It's just you want what you can't get.

## No Mark. MARK Why not?
I don't know. I really like you and I think you're very attractive.

## If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.
A little?

## Well?
Well. .this, is Mr. Lincoln. And that's the man I saw at the waxwork.

## Anyone else not coming?
Right behind you.

## Any student of Black Magic can do it. .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?
Never fear, Tony is here. Ladies first.

## Do you have a scarf?
Hey.

## Yes?
It's only two hours away.

## Why?
Besides, Dad would have freaked.

## Are you mad at me?
Listen to me. The one thing in life that I definitely don't regret...is the choice. I made to be your mother.

## What do you mean?
I started seeing things.

## Did you?
No. But once I heard...

## What?
Someone crying. A girl. I thought I was crazy.

## Who's idea was it?
Mine. His. We both...thought...

## Then why did you?
Because he was worried about me.

## Your husband?
Yes. I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.

## Do you really think so?
No.

## Fireball?
You're joking.

## How do you know it's a she?
I saw her in the water. Beside me. She was filling the bathtub.

## What does she look like?
Pretty. She's a blond.

## Do you have any idea who she is?
Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.

## What?
Try to communicate with her somehow.

## You think that'll help?
Can't hurt. And I think it's important you find out what she wants.

## Are you humoring me?
Nope.

## How?
I don't know. My aunt used to use my uncle's old pajamas and a candle.

## What's happening to me?
Well, that's what we're here for.

## You're saying you willed these events to happen?
I don't know, I'm very confused right now.

## Do you?
Me? No. Well, in the accident I was injured, but...

## What?
That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me.

## How're you holding up?
Just fine. It's a lovely party.

## I'm sorry?
I know how hard it can be sometimes.

## Uh-huh. What can be?
Well, I don't think I've seen you since the reception at Dean Ackerman's last year.

## Toward the end. You remember?
Ohhh yes. No, no. Just a little, you know...We're fine.

## Who's that?
The wives.

## Yes?
Um...

## When...when will she be back?
I don't know.

## Who?
Give me that shit. Your wife.

## I've seen you. From the window.
Who are you?

## Hello?
I'm not...

## Who? Your husband?
And I'm afraid. Oh god, I'm so afraid of...

## What? What are you afraid of?
I can't, no, no, I can't...

## You do?
For scaring you like I did. When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...

## Would you like some iced tea?
Very much.

## Of what? What were you so afraid of?
You're going to think I'm crazy or something.

## What?
Um...sure.

## Mrs. Frank?
Yeah.

## You know where she is?
No, I don't.

## What's your name?
Claire.

## Why are you here?
I don't know.

## Y'hear anything you'll let me know?
Of course.

## What was her major?
Biology. She wanted to be a doctor.

## Do we have to?
And I kicked ass. My best stuff. Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried.

## How you holding up?
Good. I'm good.

## Why does everyone find that so surprising?
Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...

## What is it?
She's not a psychic. Just a very enlightened spirit.

## So you'll have some later. Notice anything...different?
Oh my god. You bought it.

## Beautiful thing, alimony. Lose a husband, get a car. Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
Absolutely.

## Listen, I've gotta run. I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
You got it.

## What?
Seance.

## What?
In the window. Norman's at work.

## Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
Place your fingers on the planchette.

## The planchette?
This.

## We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur. What's her first name?
I don't know.

## Mef? What's Mef?
It's initials. F is Feur. It's her.

## I mess around with this stuff, but I never thought anything would happen.
Are you okay?

## Does Norman know?
Jody, she's alive.

## What?
Mrs. Feur. She's alive. I met her. She's really sweet.

## Something was there. You saw it.
Then what was it?

## Did I?
Yes. Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...

## Hartford?
And he's the real thing. Specializes in cases like this, like yours.

## Why?
Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.

## Relieved?
By the time I finally got up the nerve to tell you, Stan called from the hospital and it was too late.

## Alone? On a two lane road? With a ton of Valium in your system?
All of us.

## What are you going to do?
I don't know.

## Like what?
I have an idea. But, I mean, I'm just making this up...

## What is it?
But he acted like he'd never heard of it.

## Did he say that?
Jody he was lying.

## What if he was? Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
I guess not.

## Christ, that's twice in...When did they move in?
I think three...

## What's their name?
Feur, I think. Psych department. Figures. They're all psychotic.

## When's she out of here?
Norman Spencer.

## It's today?
Yep.

## Claire?
Three o'clock.

## Whatcha reading?
Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.

## How is it?
Excellent. Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell.

## How are you?
Fine.

## Tired?
Nope.

## Wanna fool around?
Yup.

## Of what?
Of him I think.

## Did she say that?
More or less.

## Why?
To make sure she's all right.

## But what if something happens?
Claire...

## Nothing. There was...I thought I saw something.
Promise?

## Is it gone?
Hi.

## Claire?
Huh? Absolutely. Take your time.

## What are you doing here?
There were some noises. I didn't want to disturb you.

## What do you mean? Some noises where?
In the house. I was scared.

## Did you call the police?
No. Can you drive me home? I'll bring you back in the morning.

## What kind of whispering?
I don't know. Just...whispering.

## I do, I do. I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?
Think I may have cracked it.

## Really?
I think so. Maybe.

## Did you tell her?
What? No. No.

## You didn't?
Norman, you are so funny about that. No, I didn't.

## Did you call about the Feurs?
Oh, right. Yes. Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart. Wouldn't hurt a fly.

## What's going on, Claire?
Shhhh.

## What?
He did. She's in the picture. I went over to look and she's gone. The table was set for one.

## A flare?
From the sun. It's a reflection on the glass.

## Where is she then?
She could be out. She could be sick in bed for all we know.

## What am I looking at?
I didn't do that.

## Who did? Mrs. Feur?
Maybe. Point is...not me.

## Dressed?
Dinner. With Stan and his new girl.

## When?
What do you mean? Claire, we talked about it. You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...

## Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...
...since Caitlin. You don't remember this?

## What are you doing?
Restaurant. Let them know we're running late.

## Five minutes?
You're not at the center.

## What can it hurt to talk to someone?
Claire, she's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years. If you weren't thrown off balance by this, then something would be wrong.

## This is the Feur thing?
Yes. And he's going to get away with it.

## How do you know this?
We had a seance.

## Who did?
Jody and I. And she was there, Norman, she was. It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.

## What?
Maybe you resent how busy I've been.

## Sabotage?
Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or...

## The accident...?
But then you've been so much better...

## ...I'm pulling up, Yuri. I'll see you for dinner. Sure you won't stay?
No, it's fine. I'm fine.

## Do I have everything?
Yep.

## What?
Are you glad? I'm glad.

## You don't remember?
When she said it, there was something familiar...but no.

## What's wrong with me?
It's too rough.

## Since when?
I don't like this, this...

## Who?
I was there.

## Get out of my way.
Who?

## How did she know where it was?
She did it.

## Of course she did, Norman. What else could it be?
We have to get out of here.

## What?
She can't be here without me.

## How can you be sure?
I don't know, but I am. She was there and then she was gone. I felt it.

## What?
Little village down seven. Supposed to be charming.

## Do you know it?
Don't think so.

## What's that for?
Nothing.

## What, you're doing Darcy? Since when?
No, I said, I hate what I'm doing to Darcy. Oh, boy, men are stupider, it's true.

## What do you mean \"They\" are? Are you officially a woman now?
Oh, I wish. A woman wouldn't have screwed over the woman she loved. No, they don't think that way.

## Then what is he...?
A spacial entity. An organized energy. something that precedes our definition of existence.

## Two what...?
Two heartbeats.

## How do you know about Rowan ...? I didn't --- Cemetery...?
A spirit. Perhaps evil... ...and he has come to you- with Diedre gone - you've... inherited him.

## No scaredy-cats in the Talamasca, huh...?
Rowan.

## I'll probably be back in a week...but I can't spend Christmas in that house. you'll check on her - every day...?
Every day twice.

## Gifford - that box glued to your hands...?
Aren't they gauche...? Those steel things are so - common.

## You came. I'm your Aunt Carlotta, my dear.
My...mother...?

## I don't want the -
I want to see my mother. Where is she...?

## Eighty million doll --- ?
And this - if you decide to take the rest.

## What is it...?
He's shown himself to you... on the deck. In the storm.

## He'...?
Lasher touched you and you loved it.

## Lie...?
There are things you will not tell him.

## Like this...?
You bastard...

## Made it...?
It is from love.

## It you harm Michael, I will let my anger loose. And you will feel that. Do you understand...?
You're very clever, aren't you...?

## A girl...?
Wrong...? Science is not magic.

## Aaron was in the dream. A dream tilled with spirits. you killed him, didn't you...?
It was an accident. Gifford, too.

## MAN How is your heart, Father...? Is the Timex still ticking...?
MAN I am your son. I would not wound you. I could not - ever.

##  Like this... LIKE THIS...?
 Yessss...

## I don't remember you at all- You - you saved my life- Bizarre thing to say, isn't it...?
As far as touching things, yes. But the vision - that keeps pouring into my head- It won't go away God - if I could just understand it.

## I'll bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to life and then seduce you.
What do you see...?

## What're you - a mindreader...? Who was the man on the kitchen floor. ~.?
My uncle. Graham. He and my Aunt, Ellie raised me. He - he - had a stroke- Just before Ellie died - of cancer. Last year.

## And whose houses do you design...?
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's... The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...

## Too much... too fast...?
Mm-hmm. Scared- I feel a little like the moth and the flame.

## It's come to that, huh...? Three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life...?
Ms. yin, and Mr. yang Aha!

## Why don't you let at do that...?
Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.

## Doctor's orders- - -?
Captain's orders.

## Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?
Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?

## Mad. for each other.
You could fly down tomorrow. I could be there the next day I think I can last that long without you.

## Rowan...?
Listen. Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...

## What about you coming down here...?
Go to LAX and get on a flight to New Orleans. Go to the Ponchartrain Hotel and wait for me. I'll call you there.

## Wait a minute. Rowan - what is going on...?
Goodbye, Michael. I love you.

## You know...?
I know. It's not possible --- but I know.

## But it scares the hell out of you, doesn't it. Michael...?
Yes. I love you. Very much.

## Let's see.

Hi. You - you wanna get some breakfast...? Maybe see a movie...?

## Bullshit! Let me in! Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
Why bother to ask, Ro...? Why don't you just make me stay,..?

## Well, Normie - you won't have to worry about this one being finished for a lonnnnng time. How are the hands...?
The guy I told you about - Aaron...? He says I can learn to control them. That I could lose the gloves at some point.

## That's a wasp. Fuckers'll sting a tree if they're bored- so - where is she...?
Wow...

## Just nervous. Getting married, you know. Got the rings...?

He's got great hands.

## Mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that. I mean - hell, they're all crazy anyway - right...?

## The one on the left - definitely...
Papers...?

## As long as you get the HACKSAW piece done by FRIDAY... FRIDAY?
Yes - it's about bank safety deposit boxes - I wonder if you might just explain how they work - and maybe even show me round.

## That's very kind of you MR GRIFFITHS...?
BRIAN...

## Yes it is...
But - If you could show me round now - and I'll meet you later?

## That's right...
Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?

## And it can't be forged?
Yes, I'm sure you could - but I can't risk you loosing your job

## I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?
Sure...

## It says in the contract I can have a lock fitted - is there a problem ANGELA?
My names isn't ANGELA...

## Sugar?
Yes, one and a half please.

## Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore?
No she didn't...

## I don't know...
What did you do with her?

## Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white?
I don't know...

## Why should I feel sorry - they're dead.
Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE?

## How long have you been watching me?
I have something I have to show you...

## Tell me how it happened...
What didn't you like about her?

## Did you?
No...I didn't do it...I wish I had but I didn't. I was beaten to it. STEPHANIE became my mother.

## What was your relationship with STEPHANIE?
I want it to stop - it all to stop...

## What?
Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons

## What's wrong?
Nothing could be better...

## What is it?
Open it...

## I am sorry...
Where are you going?

## LESLIE? Is that good enough?
Yes - I suppose so...

## whats wrong...what have I done wrong?
Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...

## WAIT FOR WHAT!?
At 2.00...

## What happened?
I had an accident - I fell down stairs...

## Is LESLIE here?
No he had to - he's just - he's out...

## As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems?
Get out...

## You're a novelist - why didn't you tell me?
And not just any novelist - a great novelist - it was an impressive piece of work ELLEN...

## I thought it was you - how are you?
I'm good - I was just making a delivery near here, so I thought I would see if you were about...

## Dead?
Or was it, she wished he was dead - that's it - I believe he left the country with another woman - all rather sordid.

## Who said anything about surgery...It'll only take a moment.
So she didn't mention anything more about it?

## Sugar?
Yes - one please.

## See? Did you see that?
She smiles at everyone, Ted. She's like a newborn with gas.

## Were you always this sick?
One thing for sure, Christy Malone ain't lookin THAT good naked.

## What are the odds of there being ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight?
Astronomical.

## Who the hell was your father?
Well, Dad said...

## ...A bouncer? Are you serious?
Maybe he got promoted.

## I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight?
This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.

## You kiss your mother with that mouth?
I'd kiss your mother with this mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you know...

## So far away? In Xenia?
Yeah, whatever.

## Don't tell me. Another vision of incomparable beauty?
Beauty? No. We're talking GODDESS.

## Dead?
Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.

## Brilliant! Molly, give me all you've got. For Merk.
How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties?

## Holy stinkers, what were you thinking?
We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.

## These are real, live women?
We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it.

## What gives, Don Corleone?
We reinvented ourselves.

## Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?
From your lips, to God's ears.

## Yeah?
And I was wondering.

## Yeah?
If you don't have...I mean...

## Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom?
SHUT UP! Are you serious? Of course I will...of course.

## Ted, have you lost your mind?
You like me. I like you. I guess it's pretty obvious to everyone.

## So that's a maybe?
The answer is NEVER, Ted, NEVER. Except maybe in your dreams.

## Yeah? You like?
Makes your shoulders look so big and broad.

## You know...take the pictures?
I remember the first time you walked into Mrs. Temple's class in 2nd grade. Blue gingham dress. Blond ponytail.

## Well?
You have changed since second grade.

## I mean, what do you think?
You expect me to think at a time like this? There isn't a drop of blood in my brain.

## Maybe on the outside. But inside, deep down, I've always been dripping with special sauces. Are you hungry?
God, you are so hot.

## We can't accept it. It's much too expensive. Right, dear?
Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but...

## Sweetheart, what is it?
I always wanted Craftsman tools. He even got me the limited edition Buckeye colors.

## Don't you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family?
We miss you. We miss our son.

## The lesson being?
Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end.

## Well, why should I?
They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. There was no place for a baby.

## Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.

## Like one of those \"National Geographic\" specials with the topless chicks?
Whatever helps you cope.

## I know they were simple people, but did this trip help your college fund at all?
Your mom said you've been ignoring your chores.

## You ordered a Winnebago?
THAT is your dream, not mine. My dream is so far beyond anything YOU PEOPLE could even imagine.

## You do know how to drive?
I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.

## Want a lesson?
Now release the brake. And slide the stick into first gear.

## Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?
Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.

## Who exactly ARE you?
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.

## And who IS Ted Nelson?
Or do you have a taste for the good life, Ted? It's in your blood.

## After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
Whatever you want.

## Well?
I guess...I don't know...I guess we should leave if we're not wanted.

## Can you believe that was me?
Before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. The rest is history.

## You mean they knew who I was?
They kept this scrapbook of your life. It meant the world to them.

## How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia?
Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.

## Are they hitting you up for donations? Asking you to sponsor the local quilting bee?
You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.

## Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.

## It's really late...do your parents know where you are?
Impressive. This is bigger than our whole house.

## So, what brings you here at his hour?
My new bike.

## My room?
Better view, more spacious, new carpet. It's a no-brainer.

## You want it in writing?
Just a formality.

## Are they okay?
I miss them, too.

## Is it true? Is ignorance bliss?
Look, I loved \"Exposed!\" and I hate it that you got busted. I know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it's really not THAT BAD.

## What is it, William Randolph? Your balls need scratching?
Your article sucked.

## In what sense?
In the sense that there is no \"hidden agenda\" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.

## Me?
\"Local boy inherits more money than god.\" Call me crazy, but I smell human interest.

## Really? You wanna write about me?
I have to admit, I always felt... different.

## Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?
I don't get the distinction.

## Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.

## Is this an gritty expos or a candy ass press release?
Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.

## Well? What do you think of her?
You're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax.

## You're implying she's, what, a gold digger?
Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive.

## Why can't you be nice to me?
You've got enough people kissing your ass.

## Where are we going?
To the best hiding place in the world.

## And then what?
Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.

## He's on the move?
I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.

## You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?
At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.

## Wearing them? Or humping them?
My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.

## What about you?
I'm very aural.

## Do you trust me, Julie?
Not a chance.

## Which explains the continued success of \"Heaven\" for how many decades?
You're quick. I like that.

## You think you're working with chimps here?
The thing is, I made a commitment. I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word.

## Planet Ted. Five years from now. What's happening?
I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.

## Yellow pages?
Let your fingers do the walking.

## They're playing our song. Dare I ask for this dance?
You better.

## What is this? Does everybody know everything I'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day?
No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.

## What? Having spring break ruined by will readings?
What about Charlie? You boys could make it a little adventure.

## Charlie, at a will reading? What did I do to deserve this?
I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in Siberia, you know.

## Did you have a nice flight? Are they taking good care of you?
Yeah, I'm doing fine. I have so much to tell you. I don't even know where to begin.

## What is all this? When are you coming home?
Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry.

## Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes?
Only the best for my mother.

## You promise you'll finish school?
I'll make you very proud.

## But how would we pay our bills?
Like take that trip to Buckingham Palace. Go deep sea fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. Now's your chance.

## But who would run the store?
Forget the store. Think big.

## Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me?
Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.

## You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire?
That's a good start, yes. A very good start.

## You're crossing the line, Mr. Nelson.
I guess you won't be wanting that Rolex I sent you, then?

## A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin?
I'm warning you.

## What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.

## You called the cops on us?
Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.

## You do like girls, don't you?
Of course I like girls.

## A lot? I mean, a whole lot?
As much as possible.

## You're sure?
The parties are held in here when the weather dips below seventy. Which is seldom.

## Ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy salon?
Indeed it is. During the day, visitors prefer to be outside, au naturel. As it were.

## There you are, Ted-baby. Everything all right?
Yeah. Everything's cool.

## YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
You are a multi-media magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms.

## Me? The King of Coitus?
The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.

## Really? You'd do that for me?
I've been very lazy for a long, long time.

## You think we should be more open minded?
The world is a big, beautiful place. We can open new markets in Africa and Asia. Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.

## Really? So I'm doing OK?
My father must've been amazing.

## Seriously? I'm doing all right?
I owe it all to you. Without your help I'd be lost.

## Yes?
My job. Back off, Benedict.

## I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling?
Bad news.

## People pay good money for that?
I'm just a messenger.

## My parents? What do you mean?
You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.

## So, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life?
I have the feeling, they got it down already. They're a step ahead of us, Artie.

## How you doing, Artie?
I... You know... I...

## Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid?
Kelly.

## She's going to wash your Jeep?
Senior class fund-raising gig. I told 'em they could hose down the Jeep. Hey, come on. It's for a good cause.

## And where might that be?
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.

## How soon can we get something?
We can get blood type right away. Dental records will take longer. You want DNA, that can take weeks.

## The teeth doin' any talkin'?
Ray. Stop calling. I told you the dental records will take time...

## What about the blood?
Could be hers. Types match. Could be a lot of other people's too...

## What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
Then I guess Walter can kiss that arm of his goodbye. He don't use it for no good deeds anyway.

## You come all the way out here to watch Walter?
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.

## About Suzie?
Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.

## She still work there?
Was there ever any kind of investigation...

## You okay?
I'm fine. Nice TV.

## How are you, Kelly? Would you like to take a break for a minute?
I just want to get it over with. My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.

## Was there penetration? Did he put himself inside you?
Yes. I said stop. I screamed. I mean that's how it sounded in my head. He hurt me...

## Then what?
He kept saying, \"Let it happen, let it happen.\" Then he just stopped.

## And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car?
Again. I think we covered this. I told her I was going to call a cab.

## Did you call anyone? Did you call her house to see if she got home? Did you call the Masons?
No.

## Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows?
Suzie Toller is missing.

## How long?
She didn't cone home last night. We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.

## Suzie?
I've got that two o'clock in town.

## That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide. You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior?
All I'm saying is, I think we should go slow here.

## You're telling me you believe the guy?
All I'm saying is, we let Sandra Van Ryan push us too hard, we're going to wind up looking stupid.

## You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay?
The skinny brunette.

## Lombardo's settlement?
Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.

## Unless what?
Unless you're setting up Sandra Van Ryan for the big payday.

## This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it?
Eliminate the competition.

## Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?
I net a guy in a bar.

## Were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you didn't do what you could to stop it?
We all have...

## You have someplace to be?
If you want company...

## Where's the body?
The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there. But he's made a mistake.

## You don't think Sam could've put it there?
Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.

## Will you do me one favor?
Ray, you heard him...

## What if I'm right, Gloria? What if I'm right and Hunter's wrong? What do you do if you see a bad thing coming?
Stick with me on this Gloria. I need you...

## And if the teeth aren't Suzie's? You'll give this up?
If I'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a promise.

## Where's Lombardo?
He's leaving the country. And I don't give a shit.

## That bothers you?
Yeah, maybe, a little.

## Why is that?
You didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news.

## We need to tape the interview, Suzie. No one will see it but us. Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride?
About a year ago.

## He dropped Jimmy off first?
Yeah.

## And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there?
No.

## Did he come in with you?
I guess.

## At that point were you able to fight him off?
No. He stopped by himself. Okay? That's all. Let me go.

## Where's this coming from?
I want a full-scale investigation.

## What about witnesses?
We've got three. Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.

## Are you crazy, Ray?
You heard Kelly say \"Sam.\" That was Lombardo on the phone. And you saw the girls...

## I fucked up. I lost control of the situation, the one thing they train you for... God, what did I do?
Just tell us what happened.

## She bit you?
I told her I was coming with her. She nodded, like she understood. We stood up together.

## You didn't cuff her?
The teeth, were they...

## I wanna go home now.
You guess? Did he or didn't he?

## What did you do then?
Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...

## Okay! He did. He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me. Now, can I go home?
He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt.

## I'm sorry... you said it hurt? Why?
Because... it was the biggest I've ever seen. And I've seen a lot on their way through Jack's Fish Camp.

## Ms. Toller?
I said he did.

## Ms. Toller. I'm asking you now, under oath, did Samuel Lonbardo rape you?
This wasn't my idea.

## I'm sorry?
Your Honor... Please...

## Hey, you're working for it. Least you're supposed to be.
Come on. Beats study hall, doesn't it?

## A ride. You want one?
Yeah. But I got my bike.

## I say something funny?
No. But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...

## I can't believe you called Sam. What's the matter with you?
I'm scared, that's what. I'm scared there's no one to trust.

## You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?
Oh, for Christ's sake.

## What are you looking at?
Nothing.

## Is there some reason why you're here?
Curiosity, I guess.

## You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?
The thing about it is, threesomes so rarely work out.

## You notice my new jumper?
My friends buy me clothes, so I don't look like trash.

## Kelly. What is it?
I miss Dad.

## What?
I was raped. By Sam Lombardo.

## He... Sam Lombardo?
Yes. God, Mom...

## Where, the mall?
A friend of mine bought a boat.

## Deal. You know, I just looked out front. My ride wasn't there. You suppose you could give me one?
Don't forget the car wash.

## So, where you off to now?
Aren't you forgetting something? Your coupon. We gotta have it.

## Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
So you got my mom's money.

## How much?
About six and a half million dollars.

## Do it to ourselves?
We have to stick with the plan.

## Kelly. Is Suzie there?
Yes.

## Shit. I was afraid of that. She left this garbled message on my machine. Can you calm her down?
Why can't you come...

## Then do it. I need you on this Kelly. Do it tonight. We'll figure something out... Okay?
I'm here.

## Hello?
Hello.

## And you believe her?
I don't know. I want to see you...

## You think that's wise?
Um-huh. And guess what else? I have toys.

## Can't you take that stupid thing off?
Not in here. Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes.

## What's that supposed to mean?
Nellie Gail Ranch...

## Who is it?
Detective Duquette, Ms. Van Ryan. Let me in. Now.

## Where she lives. In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
I'm placing your daughter under arrest.

## So Suzie, you called us, remember?
No.

## Will they?
It doesn't look like it.

## Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?
You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie. You get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser.

## You got something against cigarettes?
Yeah, they're bad for your health. I'm tryin' to look out for you...

## About what?
Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts. Somebody's got to go.

## Is this supposed to mean something to me? What triangle?
You, Kelly, Sam.

## Is that what you think? You have friends? Is that what they told you?
I don't mean who you're thinking. I have other friends...

## Hey, Ray. Guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and Sam's?
Why don't you tell us one more time, how Kelly came to be with you, alone in your house.

## But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her. Isn't that against the rules?
It is and I don't. Ordinarily... But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...

## Yeah, well, you fixed that. What the hell happened, anyway?
The bitch shot me, is what happened.

## Hey, what did you want me to do, die?
Kelly was supposed to be framed, not killed. What I'm telling you is, I don't like surprises.

## You mean this thing?
Yes, we call it a winch. And these are shrouds, and these are stays.

## I thought this was supposed to be a vacation. Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
Come on, man. I'll make a sailor out of you yet.

## Jesus, man... You okay?
That how you planned it? You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean...

## How much is about six and a half million divided by three?
Jesus. Two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change.

## Shut up. Don't fall apart. The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?
Yeah, right.

## Are you mad at me?
No, no. Look, I probably should have told you a little more, about the part I intended to play. We'll go through it all again tonight.

## What?
That was the same thing Ray said.

## What's wrong?
Fuck the winch. I wanna drive.

## We?
Well, I'd need the famous Lombardo charm, not that you'd have to do anything you haven't done already.

## What? You're going to drive off without even saying hi?
Hi, Sandy.

## Why don't you come in, have a drink?
Can't. Got a passenger.

## Listen, Kelly skipped school. Have you talked to her?
No.

## Didn't you see her this morning?
To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday.

## Look. I know you're seeing Barbara Baxter. So what?
So maybe I'm a one-woman man.

## I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?
Valet? You jest of course. I am a U.S. Marshal.

## Just another bureaucratic foul-up. You know how these pencil-pushers are. So, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened?
You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy. But nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment.

## Put them all together and what do we have?
A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes? Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.

## Then why kidnap them? Why not just kill them?
\"Ay, there's the rub.\" Take a look at this file on Professor Morton. Quite a brilliant fellow... metallurgy.

## You need that real often?
Always hoping. Or this...

## Try what?
Yes, aha. A brass screw.

## Limestone quarry?
Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.

## Prepare what?
My disguise. And here...

## Then we've got our proof. Excellent. And where do we find this fortunate scientist?
You know your Morse Code almost as well as I.

## Almost?
Yes. Now, observe....

## You feeling all right?
Come on, Jim. I'm serious. Dot... Dash. It'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it.

## Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it.
Now, what was that?

## All what?
All that jumping and kicking.

## Jim, are you all right?
No, I'm not all right. They got away. And we can't even follow them. They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.

## What way is that?
So... spontaneous. All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.

## So... what happened?
Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.

## Uh... how long ago was this?
I was six. And ever since, my policy is, Act first and worry later.

## Can you fill me in here?
Sure. We have no idea what's going on.

## Know what this is?
Sure. It's a wind-up... thing.

## It is?
He's going to put on a pith helmet and kill some guy named Willard.

## What's this?
This? I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.

## And people are actually fooled by that?
Not again.

## You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?
When we find him, he is mine.

## What if these tracks are just leading us to an Indian village or some old coot's mining claim?
Not likely. There must be tracks of twenty different wagons. Freight wagons, carriages, buckboards...

## I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
There's only seventy-eight.

## Are those just button buttons or...?
Of course not.

## In the next two minutes?
Artemus! Look at that. Brand spanking new. She's a beauty, huh? Let's get rolling.

## Well, sure. Didn't you get your orders?
Well, we'll stay in touch... you know.

## He's not giving up?
We'll see.

## Anyone?
Here. Mr. Tyler. He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.

## Really?
Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory. Texas.

## Your guests, ma'am?
Yes, in a way. I'm the Doctor's social secretary. I handle his correspondence, send out the invitations, you know.

## Well, I owe you one, don't I?
You most certainly do.

## Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?
You tell me.

## Thank you. But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?
I suppose so. But life can be hard for a man, too.

## Would that include me?
Oh, I would hope not.

## Really? Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?
My. It's gotten longer.

## Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?
Well, yes sir. A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case...

## French?
Yes sir.

## And?
And now the job's yours.

## ... well, of course you can. Mr. President, what a surprise. What brings you here?
On my way to Denver...

## Where'd he say he was going to do this?
He didn't. That's your job. I'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic. Good luck. Nice train. But mine's nicer.

## When you're three and a half feet tall, sir, life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not.... Come with me, won't you?
I must compliment you on Miss Thompson... an exceptionally charming assistant.

## How embarrassing. Did I hold up three fingers?
Why don't we just cut this routine short? Whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk.

## Dr. Loveless?
The U.S. is my jurisdiction.

## The first.
That would be... the Mexican War?

## So, I'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an Emperor and a murderer?
Easy now.

## Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
Easy? Easy? On just what grounds should I take it easy!?

## Who were they? What do they want with me?
We'll explain on the way.

## Who was this partner of his?
A Southern gentlemen. I don't recall his name. I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.

## Are you all right?
For the moment. But I fear not for long. I'm of no use to him now.

## He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he?
He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out.

## I beg your pardon?
You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.

## Well?
They're coming.

## You're not going to use it, are you?
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...

## It's you they're after, Madmarti- gan. What did you do this time?
They're not after me. They want the baby.

## Willow Ufgood.
Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk?

## Yes...?
I hope you are comfortable here, inside my kingdom...

## You mean, you know who this baby belongs to?
She belongs to all of us. She is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth.

## Me?
You are the guardian, Willow. You must take her to Tir Asleen.

## What is Tir Asleen?
You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.

## If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?
You're strong enough. But you're going to need courage, Willow.

## You! Are you the mother of that child?
No. I mean yes.

## Why not?
Gawd...you're...beautiful...

## Say what?
I love you.

## Willow, why don't you use your mag- ic to get us out of here?
Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.

## We're a tiny version of all that?
As above, so below.

## Can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress, Raziel?
Please? I'm dyin' of thirst in here.

## Good. How long will it take?
Don't make me angry, Peck.

## Do any other daikinis ever come by here?
Why.

## I don't know.
Are you okay?

## You a woodcutter?
Farmer.

## You all right?
These burns. My arms. Ouch...

## Are you a warrior?
The greatest swordsman that ever lived.

## Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?
I hate this.

## I did?
So you're on your way to Tir Asleen, huh? I hate to tell you this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't exist.

## The Fairy Queen? And the baby here's a princess? And these two rodents are your guides?
Yeah me. King! But she betrayed me. She robbed me of my dream.

## She asked about you, Madmartigan.
Did she ask about me?

## Well what did she say?
She's in love.

## What are you gonna become, Raziel? Queen of the rodents?
Madmartigan! I can't stand being in closed-in places.

## Willow...this may be a bad time to ask this question but...what if Raziel's wrong?
She can't be wrong. She's a very very very powerful sorceress.

## Madmartigan, you promised me you'd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter. She is all that matters. Are you going to abandon her?
It's not a Nelwyn baby.

## Can't we keep it, Dada?
Absolutely not.

## Dada, what's a daikini?
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.

## Did give that acorn its power?
We must start with feathers, dung, and a lock of your hair.

## I hope she's all right. How much more do I have to do of this?
Till it's in a powder. The energy exits within you...

## I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self. But what's this got to do with it?
As below, so above. You hold the univers, Willow, in your hand.

## I'm all finished. Now what?
Burn it to a fine ash.

## How am I gonna do that?
The limitless power of...

## We need blood. To nourish the stone. charge the stone with ener- gy.
Your will! Your will! What else could it be?

## Again, what is the magician's weapon?
His will.

## I changed her already!
How?

## Who is that horrible friend of yours?
Madmartigan.

## Who is he?
I don't know much about him.

## Queen Cherlindrea?
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.

## Take your time. Don't worry about the elves. They won't come out here.
Who?

## Why not?
This is not going well.

## How are we going to get out there?
We've traveled a long way. We're looking for Fin Raziel.

## Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery. Mine's dead... How can I help? What can I do?
Maybe milking.

## Cows. You know, cows?
I've seen pictures.

## Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You never had your hands on a teat before?
Not one this big.

## Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?
Guess I'm not used to so much.

## You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut! Anyway, they like Fred.

## Who are these orphans, anyway?
I thought I was the English.

## Your hole is healed, then?
Pretty much.

## Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the floor?
No... I saw the man who killed him.

## You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel?
No pistol. Ever.

## Is it them?
It's them, Sam. Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before.

## What are you going to do?
Got to, Sam. You and I are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars.

## Have you got your gun on now?
Sure have, Sam.

## How reliable is this kid?
Oh, he's good.

## What have you got?
Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight  street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.

## You know who?
Maybe.

## You're still convinced there's a link to the department?
If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.

## Who else knows?
Just us.

## What's your first move?
A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days.

## Who else knows?
Samuel. Samuel Lapp. But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.

## Where are you taking us?
We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.

## What was that?
He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you.

## Whacking?
Yes. And I also want to leave this city.

## Your sister said you don't have a family?
No.

## Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman?
But why would they murder...

## Where are you taking us now?
Home.

## You couldn't wait until morning?
You said we would be safe in Philadelphia.

## But John... why didn't you go to a hospital?
No, no doctor...

## Does anybody know I'm here?
Only the elders.

## How long have I been here?
Two days.

## Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure. What's that?
Your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood. I have them soaking.You can wear these.

## Your husband's?
Yes. It's good that someone can have the use of them. Besides, in your clothes you'd stand out to strangers.

## Something wrong with buttons?
Buttons are Hochmut.

## Hochmut?
Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.

## Anything against zippers?
You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.

## Where's the nearest telephone?
Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.

## The... bullets?
Oh. The bullets.

## Oh? What happened to Hochstetler?
We had some lemonade and he left.

## You know carpentry?
I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school.

## What else can you do?
I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.

## When will you be going?
Not long... A few days.

## I was being foolish?
No. I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life.

## I want you to take this... to remember by.
You're so sure of that?

## Where's my baggy pants?
Here. Whenever you want them.

## Anybody know about this?
I didn't even know about it.

## Okay, Sam. Can you tell me what he looked like?
I got there late, John.

## Johnny, what the fuck?
Listen to me  Schaeffer's part of it. Maybe at the top of it.

## Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?
Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.

## You hear me?
I hear you. I'll stay in touch.

## That's more like it. Where are you at, anyway?
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.

## Say again?
Make that 1790.

## You admit you're lying?
I admit I don't know where he is.

## Did you find him?
Not yet.

## Everything okay?
Yes, thank you very much.

## What's so funny?
Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.

## No? Why not?
You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way. But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night.

## Who was that man?
His name is John Book.

## Is the English dead?
No...

## How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung?
I have done nothing against the ordnung.

## You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
Yes. Samuel! We're going.

## She say where he is?
I don't think she knows.

## What about Carter?
Tight. But I'm working on him.

## Weird, man. No fuckin' electricity. What do you figure they plug all their shit into?
They don't have any shit.

## Nobody's going to hurt your son...
All right, where is he?

## Is this where we're going?
Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore.

## To see?
If she...

## ...have you come back?
Well, I -- I -- I am the Great and Powerful -- Wizard of Oz.

## You are?
Uhhhh -- yes...

## ...didn't you?
Who, me? Why, I'm not a witch at all. I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.

## Oh. But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?
No, I'm afraid I didn't.

## But, how do I start for Emerald City?
It's always best to start at the beginning -- and all you do is follow the Yellow Brick Road.

## Oh, will you help me? Can you help me?
You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.

## ...Toto, too?
Toto, too.

## Oh, now?
Whenever you wish.

## Are you ready now?
Yes. Say goodbye, Toto.

## Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?
Do you know any? Oh, you mean the thing -- Yes, well, I -- I never do anything without consulting my crystal first. Let's....

## That's right. What's she doing?
Well, I -- I can't quite see. Why, she's crying.

## Me?
I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.

## Has it poppies on the wall....
What's she doing now?

## ...paper?
That dog's a menace to the community. I'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed.

## Destroyed? Toto? Oh, you can't! You mustn't! Auntie Em! Uncle Henry! You won't let her, will you?
Now you're seeing reason.

## Did you say something?
Oil can....

## Oh, goodness! How did you ever get like this?
I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.

## Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?
Oh, but he will! He must! We've come such a long way already.

## Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.

## Still, I wish I could remember. But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway. We know each other now, don't we?
We might.

## Oh, he's just ascared again.
Can't that female take no for an answer?

## Yes.
Don't you know the Wizard's going to give you some courage?

## In another hour, I'll be King of the Forest. Long Live the King! If....
Oh -- unusual weather we're having, ain't it?

## I'd sooner wait outside.
Your Majesty, if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything?

## Oh -- Oh, come on.
But why? Why?

## Does it work?
No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.

## Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
I'd like to roar 'em down -- But I think I lost my roarer.

## Where's Kansas?
That's where I live. And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.

## You're going to see a Wizard?
Um-hmm.

## Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
I couldn't say. But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.

## Oh, I'll try! Really, I will.
Hooray! We're off to see a Wizard!

## ...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.
To Oz?

## Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.
Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?

## Oh, that's too bad. Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?
I don't see why not. Why don't you come along with us? We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.

## Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --
...ting the ruby slippers?

## It did?
I don't know.

## What happened?
Somebody pulled my tail.

## And you're going to lead us.
What was that?

## Yeah. Me?
Yes, you.

## I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
That's right.

## Oh, scared, huh?
I haven't slept in weeks.

## Why don't you try counting sheep?
That doesn't do any good -- I'm afraid of 'em.

## Whozat?
Yeah.

## We do.
Dorothy? Well, what has Dorothy done?

## Animals that -- that eat straw?
Oh - look out.

## It's a whozis.
You know something?

## Whew! That wasn't my plan - but something happened, didn't it?
Yes.

## You promised us real things -- a real...
What about us?

## How can I ever thank you enough?
Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, Ive heard them all.

## What happened to Len Tashka?
Couldnt make it. Splitting headache.

## Bond --
So who are you?

## When this is over we should bury the hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner?
Its a bomb alright. Were still dead if the trigger charge goes off...

## What the hell are you talking about?
Its part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack. The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.

## Whos she?
Elektra King.

## What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
I was hoping you could tell me.

## What is it?
She just upped the stakes. All her chips are on the table now. And Ms life is part of the bet.

## Is there another way?
We go down to the torpedo bay.

## Do you know what youre doing?
Like riding a bike.

## What kind of bikes did you ride?
Just wanted to put him on edge...

## So isnt it time you unwrapped your present?
Dislocated collar bone. If any more tendons snap... It wont just be two weeks out of action.

## Perhaps after this ... test?
...yes?...

## I could come for a second opinion?
Constructions not exactly my line.

## Old friend?
Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. Hes a man of great integrity.

## 007. What do you know of the Caspian Sea?
And now its up for grabs, a goldrush. Far more oil than anyone thought.

## Who told you to look at Elektras files?
I took the initiative.

## Who?
Claude Serrault. A.K.A...

## He survived?
That which does not kill me makes me stronger.

## The inside man?
Is maybe...the inside woman.

## Who did you get it from?
I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner...

## Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.
Stripped of all your weaponry, you still threaten me?

## Who is it?
You will never touch her. You will never get near her.

## Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
Consider me ungrateful.

## Beautiful, isnt it?
Yes.

## You knew him well?
He was my father.

## Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
Partially, yes.

## Who is he?
My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere. Hes decisive, vigilant. And he makes an excellent omelette.

## Does this look familiar to you?
Its my fathers pin. He wore it everyday of his life.

## Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?
If youve come here to look after me, Mr. Bond, thank you, but no thank you. I have two bodyguards, I dont need a third...

## You dont take no for an answer, do you?
No.

## What is it?
...you should rest.

## What the hell are you doing here?
If this little show is for my benefit, Ill take you home right now.

## Really?
Surely you believe in living dangerously.

## How did you survive?
I used my body on the guards. It gave me control. I got to a gun and I took my chance. Ive never told anyone that.

## ...what?
We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...

## Are you saying...Renard is the man whos trying to kill me?
You can drop the act, its over.

## Wheres M?
Soon shell be everywhere.

## All this, because you fell for Renard?
Five more turns and your neck will break.

## No-one will believe this melt-down was an accident.
Was this all about the oil?

## Know what happens when a man is strangled?
Elektra, its not too late. Eight million people neednt die.

## One... last... screw?
Oh James.

## BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
You, of course. I need some information.

## How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons?
What? This is not possible.

## Where did you get this?
Off a high-powered Paraski that was trying to kill me.

## How high up does this...arms dealing go?
Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you.

## What are doing, Bond? Trying to impress this innocent thing?
Shes no innocent. This is my nuclear consultant.

## Whats your business with Elektra King?
I thought you were the one in her business.

## She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didnt even bat an eyelid. She was paying you off. What for?
As ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks.

## No. The truth! She thought I was dead -- those blades were meant for you. What do you know that she would kill you for?
Alright, alright! Sometimes I smuggle machinery for her. Russian stuff.

## And the payoff on the tables?
A special job. A...a...a submarine.

## Where?
Istanbul.

## What?
Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit.

## What class sub does your nephew run?
C-class.

## Could...could you come?
Perhaps this isnt the time...

## Is it?
So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.

## How would you know?
Why are you like this? Because Bond is dead? Its what you wanted.

## What do you think?
This is the end.

## Everythings under control up here. Are you ready?
Yes. Au revoir...

## Do we have the range of Renards plane?
Anywhere in this circle. Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...

## Any word from him?
Still no contact yet.

## Why? What's the problem?
I can't tell you that. It is quite urgent.

## What about our end?
Well, sir ... in a worst-case scenario ... we'd assume that twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.

## What kind of time frame are we talking about?
Thirty minutes maximum. Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order.

## What about the aftermath? This so-called ... \"nuclear winter\" theory?
We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability ... may depend on a quirk of the weather.

## No idea who's behind this?
Small army, from the looks of it. He put up one hell of a fight.

## Washington?
They want in. Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU.

## Wrong answers?
There's no right or wrong. But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you. I want to help you. I want to know all about you.

## And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?
Why, doctor. I did. He was a bad dog.

## Walter. This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors. In your mind ... what gives you the right to judge?
Hi, Jon.

## What's your theory?
Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts. They don't concern me.

## WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
Jon! Get back! You don't understand.

## Blake? Dead?
Yes. I heard this morning. Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.

## Is it time? D'you have to leave for the funeral?
Not yet, there's plenty of time.

## Would you like me to stay?
Mm hmm.

## ... And just how would you manage that?
I'm not here. I'm still on Mars. I've come to collect you.

## Collect me?
Yes. In about ... thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.

## Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.

## Jon -- there's something I have to know. Did you love me once?
I don't know yet. I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years.

## Jon -- what?
The south pole. Times flowing backwards.

## Jon, where are we?
Veidts complex.

## The Comedian. He's dead. Murdered. That's all I know.
Jon -- for Gods sake, what do you see?

## My God. Murdered? -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory. He thinks someone's ... I don't know, stalking us.

## Good night.
If he comes here, I'll handle him. Remember -- I've always protected you. Haven't I? Do you need money?

## I don't know, but ... in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right. Is Laurie okay?
She's with me.

## What?
I couldn't let him interfere with my project.

## Good Lord. How'd you get it on tape?
It's not on tape. It's live. We're watching it happen.

## I've seen them! I've seen them in there.
What is it? How does it work?

## And what if youre wrong?
Im not.

## Then Ive been a very bad boy and youll have to spank me. Christ! Im doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!
What if youre wrong?

## You ruthless son of a bitch. You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
We'd better hope so. -- It's almost time.

## Sorry, it's this thing with Blake. I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
Damn straight.

## That's the one. Whatever happened to him?
He pulled it on Rorschach ... and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.

## Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing. Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you ... How about you, Laurie?
Oh, yeah. They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out. No expense account. No place to live.

## No, screw that. What you were saying before, it's absolutely right. -- I'd love to have you stay.
Maybe not, but why take chances?

## His what?
His ... whatever.

## I'm not his ... whatever. Okay?
I told you I was a little bit out of step. A lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal.

## I don't mind getting older. I'm obsolete anyway. Why try to hide it?
I like the way you look. It's strange with Jon. He doesn't age. His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look ...

## Old?
Not at all. You look very -- dashing. Here, you pick one.

## ... What?
Pick a record. I feel like dancing.

## I just realized. I'd never seen his face. I guess it was just a matter of time. He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong?
The Comedian ... Jon ... now Rorschach.

## Ohh. I could use some dinner. Who was that on the phone?
One more down. Someone tried to kill Adrian... . First time I've ever heard him scared.

## Enough is enough, Daniel. Where exactly are we?
Memory lane.

## Antarctica?
Would you want to sit out a war? I mean -- what would be left.

## What are you up to?
It's a peace rally. The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.

## The costumes. Am I right?
No way. I'm not that much of a pervert.

## You're full of yourself. What are you doing?
Long as we're on the subject of perverts ... I miss Rorschach. Let's spring him.

## What's he doing?
I think he's going to the john.

## Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
Welcome back, Night Owl.

## He saved himself. He changed the past.
What now? Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?

## We'll tell them what's happened. They'll listen to reason, won't they -- ?
Hiya, pardner. Long time no see.

## Did anybody follow you? See you come here?
Sure. You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.

## Hey. Hey. If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?
... That was quick.

## What new information?
Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU. Dr. Manhattan somehow involved ...

## Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us? What about all those poor shits with cancer?
I don't think she's coming with us.

## What happened?
The guidance system's fried. I had to switch to manual. -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.

## What caused it?
Don't know. Nothing I can think of -- -- outside of a nuclear blast.

## Adrian. What are you doing? Why wouldn't you let us in?
He's the one. He's been the one all along. Stalking us.

## With lots of ketchup?
Nothing wrong with ketchup.

## Janey, will you marry me?
I can fix it.

## -- What?
My dad's a watchmaker. I'll put it back together for you. Better than ever.

## No comment.
Thanks, no. But it's a wonderful product. Now Adrian -- your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --

## What are you saying? That Jon is radioactive?
I'm terribly sorry.

## Am I free to go?
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please. Let's move it.

## And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I. I'll ring for the guards.

## New information.
ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT!! -- How'd you find me?

## Ever see one of these before?
Too important for telephone. Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan. All linked up.

## What is that ungodly smell?
Bigger than I thought. CTU involved ...

## What is this place?
Looks like a diner.

## That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?
Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.

## Why is that?
Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.

## Is that a fact?
Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.

## Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So what's the deal? What do you need me for?
There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.

## What do I get out of it?
Not bad for a gimp.

## How about a pedicure as long as you're down there. What's this? Lo-Jack?
Yeah, I spy or I die.

## Is that all?
We're not after car thieves here.

## You did say \"Ahab\"? You're sure about that?
This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this \"Ahab\".

## Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?
Thanks.

## I'm on the way with a team to relieve you. What's the latest?
Yes it does.

## Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?
Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.

## I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
You've kept up your end of the bargain, I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent.

## Who says you're the good guys?
You know what they say, the only way to change the system is from the inside.

## No needles, huh? What about the acid bath?
All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.

## What do you have?
He was the best there was. That makes three agents lost.

## How will you fix it?
So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.

## You what? A wire transfer of this size?
If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.

## Why not? You were going to throw him in a tub full of acid, weren't you?
Alright, do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad.

## Whatchu doing here?
Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.

## We seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here, jump out with you guys?
We're anti-social. We don't have any friends.

## What game is that?
Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called \"Anarchy 99\", they're the bad guy bosses.

## \"Anarchy\" 99\"?
What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.

## What do you get if you finish?
Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.

## Like what?
He gets to be the hero.

## Do you know what a wire transfer is?
Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.

## If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing?
Yorgi asked me to.

## You do everything Yorgi says?
Go to hell.

## It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that?
Mind your business.

## Where are you going?
Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.

## I was invited. What's your story?
I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions.

## We hung out last night, remember?
Hey, take it easy. I'm just a dude trying to make a buck.

## I'm an information gatherer. You wanna go somewhere and talk about it?
That's how you eat? It's like a gerbil.

## So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?
Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.

## So there you have it. I guess you just have to ask yourself, how bad to you want out?
They tell me you're an American agent.

## What are you talking about?
There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true.

## So what's the plan with this Ahab? Are they selling it or what?
No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.

## We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.

## What's that?
I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.

## You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
I'm busted up for you, but Jesus, what the hell are you doing? Those people almost drowned on that boat and you didn't lift a finger.

## I don't know what's going on anymore. I thought I was square with that dude. Now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF.
When can I see you again?

## What are you doing with the Ivans?
I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now.

## Where are we going?
We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.

## Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?
It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.

## No, now it's about us. Let's do something for us before we both get killed. Don't you want to get to Bora Bora, Xander?
We can't leave now. We have to do something.

## Aren't you afraid?
I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.

## Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.

## Did you do your homework?
If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.

## Where's he headed?
He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there.

## You okay?
No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.

## You can't welch on me now. We had a deal.
It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?

## What are you doing?
It's about your next mission. You need to be debriefed.

## What are you doing?
It all happened so fast. Such an unfortunate accident.

## What was that for?
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.

## Nice place to start, don't you think?
That's would be me.

## They come in any other styles or colors?
This is your standard dart gun.

## You're joking, right?
Now that I've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail.

## I'm having fun, what's the problem?
I don't wanna go mersh, you know that. But hey, if this is about money...

## French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there?
Alright, so I'll get more.

## What...?
I was gonna wait till the islands, but...

## This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.

## You killed me, remember? Now I have to hide out here with you. Where have you been?
I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.

## Is this what you're looking for?
Sorry, \"dude\".

## Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
A parachute. This does not argue well.

## Who's writing this dude's dialogue?
He's a pretty good actor, though.

## They're all over the place! What the hell's going on?
Looks like we're in the middle of the drug war.

## Cops. Like a plague. No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out. How did you pick him out?
He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.

## I'm talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in Genoa and wind up here. If you don't know about 'em, who does?
I remember that one where you jump the motorcycle over the freeway at rush hour.

## We seen all your shit! So you want cars? We get whatever cars you need. What are you looking for?
Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start.

## What's this?
This is a gift. From me to you.

## You wanna see my politics?
Screw the world. If I'm gonna die for something, it better be bitches and money.

## How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?
Easy. You get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss.

## You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?
Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.

## And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.

## What does that mean?
... until he found tungsten.

## Can the Professor repair his own mind?
I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.

## I don't like him being here.
So where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration?

## What are you talking about?
If Magneto is planning to use Logan for some terrible purpose it's our responsibility to do something.

## What's wrong with him?
His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.

## Are you all right?
No. I'm... I don't know if we can do this without Charles.

## What's that?
He calls me sport one more time, and I'll blow a watermelon-sized hole through him.

## Into the Hudson?
Uh-huh.

## I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission. Jean, can you raise me up there?
It's too far.

## Jean... can you?
I'm sorry. I'm not strong enough.

## Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here?
I wanted to talk to you.

## Sure you are, sport.
How long have you been in Alaska?

## Anything else I can get you?
Some cigars. Case of beer.

## I won't light the cigars - how about that?
I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep. Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.

## What if I like the pain?
The Professor said you were a solider. Actually, I believe he used the word mercenary.

## By reading my thoughts?
If necessary.

## What if they're naughty?
You should always work with a spotter.

## What do you say?
Not interested.

## Logan, do you see this ring?
I've seen a lot of rings.

## You're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of the hearing, Ms. Grey. Three words, Are mutants dangerous?
I am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded, Senator. The wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous.

## Dr. Grey.
Math. History. Science. English. Athletics --

## Senator?
I'm sorry to come here, Ms. Grey. I was afraid if I went to a hospital, they would...

## You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?
Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.

## What is it you intend to do to me?
Let's just say, God works too slowly.

## What do you want?
Come with me and I'll let her live.

## Where am I?
You're backstage at the encore of creation.

## What am I doing here?
I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.

## Who?
A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why, but until we find out, I must ask you to stay.

## The point of what?
What if it never happens? What if they're so afraid of us that we become the enemy? -- This place is gonna be one giant cemetery.

## Where are we going?
To find Rogue.

## How?
The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.

## You designed this yourself?
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.

## He helped you?
We were friends once... But that was a long time ago.

## They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
Actually I'm feeling up to leaving.

## Why is everybody up at sunrise?
The sun is setting, Logan. You've been asleep for nineteen hours.

## What did she do to me?
I felt like she almost killed me.

## And you think it helps calling her Rogue?
I lost him.

## How?
It was Xavier's people. They knew.

## Is that what you're looking for?
A piece. Only a piece.

## Is it enough?
Enough for a test.

## Is that so?
Still trying to make the world safe for our kind. Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.

## You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?
Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes. Now come on Charles. For old times sake, for your sake... Leave him to me.

## The way what is going to be?
I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness, Charles. And this one gets a front row seat.

## What do you mean to do?
This checkmate goes to you. I didn't want to hurt anyone. But you leave me no choice.

## WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO?
I wouldn't really have let you die, you know. I just needed...

## And what do you do when you wake up to that?
I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble.

## Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me for interrupting. But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?
Yes, my dear, he is.

## And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
He is the fifth leading authority in his field.

## Frederick Frankenstein?
You have the wrong house.

## And who might you be?
Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.

## What was your grandfather's name?
Victor Frankenstein.

## Where did you get this cauliflower?
From your office, sir.

## Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
Yes, sir. But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.

## Are you trying to make me look like an idiot?
Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.

## Herr Falkstein! Did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place?
I did, sir.

## Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
Yes, sir, he was. But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.

## You're incorrigible!... Aren't you?
MMMmmmm.

## Still happy you married me?
MMmmm.

## Love me oodles and oodles?
Well... yes.

## Miss me?
I...

## Darling!...you will be careful!?
Of course.

## You have your tickets?
Yes.

## And your passport?
Yes, don't worry.

## Call me from New York before you leave?
Yes.

## Promise?
I promise.

## Does that mean you love me?
You bet your boots it does.

## Ready, darling?
Yes. I am a bit tired, after all.

## Give me a hand with these, will you, Ayegor?
What a strange fellow.

## Are you suggesting I call him master?
No, of course not. I just meant...

## Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck. Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick. Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.

## Is your room just down the hall? ... in case I get frightened during the night?
Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.

## Is it worth taking a chance?
I suppose you're right.

## You mean... the laboratory?
Yes!... the laboratory.

## May I have it, please?
There seem to be quite a few books.

## I see. And where is my grandfather's private library?
I don't know what you mean, sir.

## Surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place?
I think you must be mistaken, sir.

## I don't think so. Is my assistant taken care of?
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.

## What are you waiting around for, pickle puss?
This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.

## But I can't just drop everything and leave. I have responsibilities and obligations.
Dr. Frankenstein?

## How long will this whole thing take?
A week. Ten days at most.

## What?
Break that old man's violin.

## All right then, I suppose I owe the family that much. You'll have everything ready for me when I arrive?
Yes, sir.

## One week at the most!?
My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.

## A piece of what?
Vermicelli.

## But wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work, sir...? the re-animation of component parts?
My father was a sick man.

## But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor? Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?
You are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind.

## How old are you, young man?
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.

## And do you also say Fro dereck?
No, Fred ereck.

## Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
It's not. It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.

## You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?
Yes, that's right. My grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together. You and I should have a lot of laughs.

## Are these your bags?
Yes, just the two.

## What hump?
There.

## Why are you talking like that?
I thought you wanted to.

## What wockers?
The wockers with the knockers.

## Wockers with the knockers?
I got frightened all alone upstairs, so I came down here.

## But what you were doing?
Just putting up some tea.

## You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.

## Did you see anyone else down here?
No, but when I first came in, there was a light coming from behind that steel door.

## What is this place?
Yes, I think we could all use a good laugh.

## Do you have the name I wrote down?
Yes. Dr. H. Delbruck.

## I'm getting excited just thinking about it. What if he's not there?
He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now. I'll prepare the body.

## Why?
It's always been one of my favorite names.

## All right... elevate me!
You're sure you know what you're doing?

## This guy means business.
Tonight?

## Oh, do you like it? I'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.
It's not enough. More! More, do you hear me?

## Who are you talking to?
To you! You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.

## Why?
Someone was playing this in the music room.

## Can you play it?
Maybe...if you get here on time.

## What monster?
What d'ya mean \"What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement.

## What?
He's carrying her off now through the woods.

## I like your style, master. How do we get him here?
It's the only way.

## MMMMMmmmmmmm.
MMMMMMMMMMMMMNNNNNNmmmmmmmm?!?

## How's everything?
MMMmmmmmmmm.

## It's alive. It's -- moving! It's -- breathing! It's -- standing! What is your name?
MMMmmmmmm.

## How sweet! Such a quaint little tune.
What's that tune that you're playing

## It's an honor for me, sir. You play the violin?
Oh, just a little.

## Did you have a pleasant trip?
Yes, thank you. It wasn't bad.

## Did you ever have a roll in the hay?
I'm not sure I...get your drift.

## That's quite all right. What is it, dear?
Could I lie down in your bed for a little while? I just can't sleep.

## Would you like a sandwich?
I don't know. It just woke me up.

## Oh, Frederick... you're not only a great doctor, you're a great... you're almost a...
But who was playing it?

## I know.
A god?

## It looks that way.
Right here?

## What are you going to do?
I think I'll...carry him.

## Oh! Yes, Doctor.
Do you think you can sing it?

## Did you do it?
I think so.

## It's terrible -- the price society demands in the name of fidelity... ultimately?
Not fooling around.

## I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?
I see what you mean.

## What?
I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.

## Why don't we talk inside?
MMmmm.

## I love it when you're excited. Come then, my Apfelstrudel! Come into my arms and let me hold you.
Are you ready for me?

## There must have been someone else down here then.
Sweetheart.....Is this really you?

## His what?
His schwanzstucker.

## Do you know the theme from 'Doctor Zhivago'?
I'm getting tired.

## How do you know they're done?
The doctor said to allow seven minutes, no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed.

## Yes.
How long is it so far?

## What d'ya want to do to kill time?
Oh, Igor -- I'm so afraid! I just hope this all ends well.

## Igor -- are you sure the monster has a good brain? Are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of Hans Delbruck that night?
Sounds like visitors. It's all right -- Frau Blucher will show them in.

## Why don 't the Zulus attack?
An historical moment, Gentlemen.

## Were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory?
They spurred onto high ground, My Lord, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu. Full of sport they were, My Lord.

## Splendid horsemanship Who are they?
Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.

## Excellent. Thank you. Give them to Crealock, would you?
My Lord. This list was prepared for you. I don 't think another can understand its true value.

## You intended to bring your reserves across the river?
I'm explaining my reasons.

## And the threat of counter invasion no longer exists? 40
And the threat of counter invasion no longer exists? 40

## What's that strange name the newspaper chap's called?
Er, called Noggs, Sir Actual name is Norris-Newman. He presented credentials from \"The Standard\".

## Our runners bare his dispatches, do they not?
The only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the Royal Kraal, at Ulundi.

## Yes?
Yes.

## How quickly can you move your artillery forward?
Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.

## Which one?
So far only their scouts. But we have had reports of a small Impi farther north, over there.
