## You're asking me out. That's so cute. What's your name again?
Forget it.

## Why?
Unsolved mystery. She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.

## There.
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?

## You're sweet.
Where?

## How do you get your hair to look like that?
Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.

## So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Who knows? All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.

## I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be \"occupied\".
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?

## You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
Well, no...

## What crap?
Me. This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.

## What good stuff?
The \"real you\".

## Let's go.
Like my fear of wearing pastels?

## She okay?
No.

## Is he oily or dry?
Combination. I don't know -- I thought he'd be different. More of a gentleman...

## Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.

## You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
Hopefully.

## Queen Harry?
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.

## Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.

## What do you think?
I think you're a freak. I think you do this to torture me. And I think you suck.

## What's normal?
Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.

## Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.

## It's Shakespeare. Maybe you've heard of him?
Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend. I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.

## I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
Can we go now?

## He said everyone was doing it. So I did it.
Joey never told you we went out, did he?

## You did what?
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.

## I guess I'll never know, will I?
It's just you.

## Perm?
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...

## What if she never starts dating?
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.

## Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
Otherwise known as an orgy?

## Why?
He's not a \"hot rod\". Whatever that is.

## Padua girls. One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
Just sent 'em through.

## You the new guy?
So they tell me...

## I was kidding. People actually live there?
Yeah. A couple. We're outnumbered by the cows, though.

## How many people were in your old school?
I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter. She's not allowed to date until her older sister does. And that's an impossibility.

## Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
Because they're bred to. Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.

## You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
You could consecrate with her, my friend.

## That's her? Bianca's sister?
The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.

## No kidding. He's a criminal. I heard he lit a state trooper on fire. He just got out of Alcatraz...
Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you. So what's the point?

## They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
I'm serious, man, he's whacked. He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.

## Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
Forget his reputation. Do you think we've got a plan or not?

## You got him involved?
This is it. A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.

## Will Bogey get bent?
Are you kidding? He'll piss himself with joy. He's the ultimate kiss ass.

## The hell is that? What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
Buttholus extremus. But hey, you're making progress.

## What've you got for me?
I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.

## What'd you do to her?
I don ' t know. I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.

## You makin' any headway?
She kissed me.

## What's the worst?
You get the girl.

## The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow. Tough break.

## Where ya goin?
Away.

## Your sister here?
Leave my sister alone.

## What do you think?
You got it, Verona. I pick up the tab, you do the honors.

## You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend. And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.

## How much?
A hundred bucks a date.

## Hey.
How'd you do it?

## We're not.
Are you lost?

## Does this conversation have a purpose?
What? We took bathes together when we were kids.

## Who's that?
Mandella, eat. Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.

## What's this?
An attempted slit.

## You think this'll work?
No fear.

## Who cares?
You went to the party? I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.

## You didn't have a choice? Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.

## Can you even imagine? Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .

## Who?
William - he asked me to meet him here.

## Sweating like a pig, actually. And yourself?
There's a way to get a guy's attention.

## You hate me don't you?
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.

## And why would I do that?
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...

## Are you following me?
Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.

## hey. Great show, huh?
Do you mind? You're sort of ruining it for me.

## \"I'm getting trashed, man.\" Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
I say, do what you wanna do.

## Why?
Just let me sit down.

## Who?
Dorsey.

## What?
And I'm in control of it.

## Were you in jail?
I should do this.

## Do what?
This.

## You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
Start a band?

## So what ' s up with your dad? He a pain in the ass?
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.

## Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique? I lost my copy.
Who?

## What are you doing here?
Wholesome.

## So what did I have an effect on ?
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.

## You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
Maybe.

## The Partridge Family?
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect. And piss you off.

## So what's your excuse?
Acting the way we do.

## How?
You never disappointed me.

## State trooper?
Fallacy.

## The duck?
Hearsay.

## No.
What?

## Why not?
Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.

## So I have to have a motive to be with you?
You tell me.

## Nothing! There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
You need therapy. Has anyone ever told you that?

## My grandmother's .
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?

## What?
Wait I...

## Really? What was it like? A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
I didn't care about the money.

## A Fender Strat. You bought this?
I thought you could use it. When you start your band.

## Is that right?
Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.

## Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
Because I like to torture you.

## Oh, Bianca? Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
Don ' t you even dare...

## Then tell them I had a seizure.
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?

## Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
I thought you were punishing me.

## Why can't we agree on this?
Yeah. She left with some bikers Big ones. Full of sperm.

## I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food. Is this something I should be hip to?
No, Daddy.

## So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
Parts of it.

## Which parts?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.

## What's the matter? Upset that I rubbed off on her?
No -- impressed.

## When I go?
Oh, Christ. Don't tell me you've changed your mind. I already sent 'em a check.

## Tempestuous?
No ... I believe \"heinous bitch\" is the term used most often.

## Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now? Or do I have some time to think about it?
Just smack her now.

## Hey there. Tired of breathing?
Hi.

## Cool pictures. You a fan?
Yeah. I guess.

## You think?
Oh yeah.

## Macbeth, right?
Right.

## Kat a fan, too?
Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.

## What plan?
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.

## What is it with this chick? She have three tits?
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure. Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.

## So Dorsey can get the girl?
Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture. Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.

## You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
We're your guys.

## Are you telling me I'm a - \"non-smoker\"?
Just for now.

## Ever been to Club Skunk?
No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.

## I don't understand, Patrick. You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?
Touch of the flu.

## You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...

## What's a synonym for throbbing?
Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.

## You're not helping.
Jesus! Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?

## Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
Your daughters went to the prom.

## Did I have anything to say about it?
Ah, leave him alone. He's doing no harm.

## With a face like that? I don't want you looking at me. You hear?
He's the devil's child...

## You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
Yes, your Eminence. The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.

## If they agree to follow me, yes.
I am, Your Eminence

## Is that all that interests you? Gold?
No. The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people. I, too, will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God.

## Naturally. But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?

## He is a mercenary! Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.

## Not everything... Do you think I care? I'm a free man again. Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
Are we going to argue?

## Can't you stay with us a little?
I am busy inside.

## I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands? Is it not so?
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.

## May I ask by whom?
Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.

## Appointment to what?
Viceroy of the West Indies.

## How far from here?
I am not a seaman. But I heard it is no more than a week at sea. I hope you are not too disappointed.

## How are you feeling, Fernando?
Not bad.

## What are you listening to?
I am not listening, Father. But I can't help hearing.

## What does he say?
He asks when he can come to visit you. He left his address.

## Then you are too ambitious.
No?

## And were you never ambitious, Excellency? Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.

## Forgive me, Don Colon. But what about gold?
You defend yourself admirably...

## ... for a commoner?
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.

## What...? Do I have so many already?
To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation. A little hypocrisy goes a long way.

## What do you see?
Island. Far.

## Chief says -- how many?
Thousands.

## Why?
To bring the word of God.

## We will work with his people. We want peace. Ask the Chief if he understands?
He understands.

## How did you manage it?
With some difficulty. I had to promise them you were not a total fool.

## Why do you wish to sail west?
To open a new route to Asia. At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...

## How can you be so certain?
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...

## Wait! I've waited seven years already! How much longer do you want me to wait?
If God intends you to go, then you will go.

## What are you saying?
I lied. The journey will be longer than I said.

## How long?
I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.

## No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
Oh? So you are a new man?

## What did they say about Granada before today?
That she was impregnable.

## I know what I see. I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is. Who's not afraid. I see a women who thinks... \"What if?\"...
May I speak freely?

## Do they have such thoughts?
They come and go as naked as the day God created them...

## There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things. I must see them with my own eyes. I cannot be other than I am.

## You want a war? Fine. We are a thousand. They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill? Which tribe?
We don't need to know.

## And what do you think Mendez?
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is! But I've never seen it used at night before.

## What do you read?
Twenty eight.

## What's he doing?
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.

## Where can I meet this man?
You bloody...

## Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
Yes, Your Majesty.

## Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
He must be replaced.

## And who would you think of, for such a task?
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.

## Then why?
Because he is not afraid of me.

## Where are we going?
I'm coming with you.

## You bring the cigarettes?
Oh, sure.

## What about Oleg?
Disappeared. They're looking everywhere. Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.

## What about my movie rights? Book rights?
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.

## What's your cut? How much?
I would say...half. Half is fair.

## What else do you need?
I need to know about your background. I need to know about your upbringing. Why you're here.

## Your mother was blind?
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.

## Back in the Czech Republic?
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind. And my father blamed me for her blindness...

## Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born. Put it out. Can you put the cigarette out?
That's what he did to me. He put cigarettes out on me.

## Your father put cigarettes out on you?
Out on my back when I was a small boy.

## I'm abused. Don't you think?
I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.

## Now I become custody of police department?
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.

## Are you married?
Divorced.

## Somewhere else?
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.

## So...the station is empty?
Yeah. This way.

## You considered becoming a prostitute?
Yes, I considered it.

## Did you ever turn tricks before?
No.

## What about back home?
No.

## What are you asking me?
I'm just trying to find out who you are.

## You don't know. I'm sorry. I was desperate. That's not me. I shot a cop. Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
They're not gonna send you right back.

## Are you alright?
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.

## Ludwig? He's gay - are you jealous?
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.

## Do you have coffee?
In the kitchen.

## Forget about me. You have enough problems of your own.
What are you doing?

## ...Do you really want me to forget about you?
I don't want to drag you down with me.

## C'mon, start at the beginning. You know these people?
Tamina was a friend of mine. My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.

## Arrest you for what? Why would we arrest you?
I'm from a small town in Slovakia. Like the South here. The Police is right, a civilian is wrong. So I fled.

## Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
You're a cop - you'll never believe me.

## Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.

## I let her take a shower.
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?

## A shower!? Did you take one, too?
Okay. But not water sports.

## But Chief? Over this?
There's nothing to talk about. Get a good lawyer. You're suspended until your trial.

## What was that, Korfin?
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief. As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.

## Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
Yeah. He finished awhile ago.

## Alright. Swing by her apartment. Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street. You got that?
Yeah.

## Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
It was freaky, I'll tell you. Stupid kid.

## When?
Tomorrow. At lunch.

## What's he looking for?
A timer.

## Where is she?
Takin' a bath.

## Any I.D.?
Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.

## Only one guys checked in?
Yeah.

## Are you hit?
No. I'm okay.

## Who's there?
Police. We'd like to ask you a few questions.

## What's wrong?
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.

## Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
No.

## Did you tell him you did?
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.

## What are you saying?
Daphne. Another guy came in asking me about her, too.

## Why don't you explain it, Bobby. Hey Camello! You mind punching a hole in the floor?
It's your crime scene now. You can do what you want.

## Watch the news?
Nah, I musta missed it.

## Nah, why should you?
I don't even watch TV.

## If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too. What about the report?
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.

## Eastern Europe. Like what? Romania? Hungary?
I'll come with you.

## You're Polish?
My folks are.

## Mind if I ride along with you?
This has nothing to do with your fire.

## You thirsty?
I'm on duty.

## Something back home?
She's fucked. Even if that story is true.

## You wanna talk to her alone?
Yeah.

## What would your girlfriend think of that?
I don't have a girlfriend.

## You're her Savior? Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
You know what I'm saying here.

## Just a shower?
Yeah, just her in the shower. Nothing happened. Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...

## Why'd you help me back there with the Chief? Why'd you stand up for me like that?
You know, I don't know. I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.

## What do you want?
Your opinion. You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie. And write books.

## Detective, does it look like a murder?
We don't know that yet. It's much too early. There's a lot to be done.

## How many victims are up there?
There are two bodies found at this point.

## Can we go up to the crime scene?
You know you can't do that. C'mon.

## Is it drug related?
We don't know. When I have more I'll let you know.

## Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
I can't talk right now. We have some things to take care of.

## I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you. Is this somehow related to the fire department?
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.

## Okay. But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
He was hurt, but not seriously. He'll be fine.

## Do you have the suspect in custody?
Alright, cut, cut, cut.

## Eddie, are you okay?
Yeah. Now's not a good time.

## Alright?
Alright.

## Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
Alright, alright, Eddie. Don't patronize me.

## Well, who was it that taught me how to do that? Huh?
You're ruthless.

## Look at this. You have blood on your shirt. Whose is it?
Could be Leon's.

## Jesus. And last week you came over with blood on your shoes. What am I going to do with you?
Don't worry about the damn phone. I won't answer it.

## I'll tell you tonight. Let's do it tonight. As soon as you get back we'll talk. We'll talk.
Okay. Okay. Hold that thought just for a second. They only call me when it's an emergency. Just hold that thought. Can you call back?

## Promise?
Yeah. I'll do that. As long as you're not patronizing me.

## You promise?
Yeah. I promise.

## So what's unique?
Not what. Who.

## Ready?
Keep them out of my way.

## Okay. You ready?
Yeah, yeah. Jesus.

## Any chance we can do that again?
Again? I didn't wanna do it the first time.

## Okay. You work in a vodka factory. I understand that. And what kind of work do you do?
I am butcher.

## You're a butcher? What do you use pig intestines for?
You stuff sausage in it.

## And what do you do with the bones?
Dog food.

## No. Are you proposing?
Come to 45 Broadway. Don't bring the Police. Come alone or you'll be in my next film.

## Were you a fireman? That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
My father was. He gave me many lessons about fire. Now it's my friend.

## Where's your partner?
The Sheraton! On Broadway! Room 210. Go get Oleg. He'll kill you.

## Where's Czech girl?
Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be. I'm a little schoolgirl, I'm mommy, I'm a Czech girl.

## I like to talk to the person who runs the service. Can you give me address?
Yes sir.

## What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
Two weeks holiday.

## How much money are you carrying with you?
Yes.

## No, you're travelling together. I want to talk to you together. Hi, how are you? Can I take a look at your documents? Are you related?
We are both from Prague.

## How long are you planning to stay?
Two weeks.

## I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
He doesn't speak English.

## Who is he?
New York's finest. This is his case.

## Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
In here, says he wants a million.

## Million?! The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
Yes. Both.

## Did you hear what I said?
I want to document my trip to America.

## What?
Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.

## What is it?
The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.

## Why not?
Put the camera down, Oleg.

## In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?
The one who got caught in the bathroom. George Michael.

## Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
Your idea? I thought it was my idea.

## Credit?
Yes. Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.

## Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
You got that?

## I can get you a job.
Did you hurt her?

## A job?
Yes, the money is good.

## What are you doing here?
Of course he's moody. He thinks he's in love.

## I know.
In love? With who?

## What do you mean you know? He told you he was gonna propose to me?
Well, he...

## Okay. You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national. How do you know one another?
I speak English.

## Then answer my questions. Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
New York.

## Yes, we're in New York now. But where are you planning to stay in New York?
A cheap hotel.

## What are you coming here to do?
I'm here for movies.

## Excuse me?
No. Go ahead.

## So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?
That's what it looks like to me.

## What was that?
Evidence. Of a homicide.

## Okay, you're under arrest! Now you happy?
Fire Department? Firemen don't carry guns.

## How did you start the fire this time?
I used an accelerant.

## Yeah? What kind?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.

## Oh yeah, why?
Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now!

## The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out. Let it run.
Clean?

## But you knew that, right?
You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer? Wish I had a picture of it.

## What?
That's why he was so quiet. He was testing us.

## Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.
What?

## Yeah?
Maybe you can be his stand-in.

## You hear that question, Garcia?
You go home. I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.

## Aren't you tired?
If I go home I won't be able to fall asleep anyway.

## How was it?
Not good.

## What are you gonna do?
Don't you get it? He knew he was gonna get caught! That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.

## Your doctor?
Yes. My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.

## ...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.

## And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
We're in negotiations, that's correct.

## But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
That doesn't apply to me because I'm not a criminal. I'm not a criminal! I wasn't convicted.

## Sure, what is it?
Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.

## What's up?
It's about my salary cheques.

## Yes?
Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.

## Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.

## Oh?
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.

## How?
Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.

## But not completely inconceivable?
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.

## Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.

## Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
Two more.

## Hal?
Yes.

## What is it, Hal?
MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.

## You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
Yes, I know.

## Hal, is there anything bothering you? Anything that might account for this problem?
Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.

## Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Yes, it is, Hal.

## Too bad about Frank, isn't it?
Yes, it is.

## I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?
I'm having a party tomorrow.

## Are you coming to my party?
No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.

## When are you coming home?
In three days, darling, I hope.

## One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.

## Where is Mrs. Brown?
She's in the bathroom.

## How many days until you come home?
Three, darling. One... two ... three. Be sure to tell Mommy I called.

## I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
Yes, Daddy.

## Well, how's it going back there?
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.

## And your charming little daughter?
Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.

## How is gregor?
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.

## Well, where are all of you off to?
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.

## Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.

## How do you do, Mr. Miller?
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.

## Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Yes, very pleasant.

## Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Fine.

## Are you quite sure?
Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.

## Really?
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.

## You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
That's right.

## Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
Certainly.

## Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.

## How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.

## But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.

## I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.

## We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.

## What do you mean?
I see.

## I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.

## Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.

## Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
True.

## Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
That's true.

## That's true
That's true.

## Yes, Hal, what's up?
It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.

## Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.

## Yeah?
I want to pick up my car.

## Name?
Hammond.

## How about chargin' the battery?
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.

## Now how's your memory doin'?
Fuck off. I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.

## Whaddya mean, buy?
Pros.

## Pay money?
Yeah, dummy. Money.

## Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.

## Hey, what about me?
And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you know, a squaw.

## Hey, what kind of talk is that?
Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...

## Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.

## You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...

## What's the matter with my place?
No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...

## Hey, don't do that. I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
Hey, no, I'm tryin' to be nice. Buy yourself something pretty. I'd do it, but I got to go. I got this cop waitin' for me...

## I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin', okay?
Now you're talkin'. See ya...

## How about it?
I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is. I haven't seen him for two weeks. And I don't think I will. He owes me money...

## Where's ganz?
In the back. Down the other corridor.

## Try Cates. And let's talk in private, okay?
Sure, anything you want.

## You here to write my life story?
Not likely, Reggie. Maybe I just need some help.

## Yeah?
I can deliver Ganz. But you gotta get me outta here first.

## What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
I got a lot to protect.

## This prison gives out $400 suits?
What are you talkin' about? This suit's mine. It cost $900.

## Okay, let's get down to it. I did my part and got you out. So now you tell me where we're goin'?
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit. We go to him right away.

## What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.

## Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.

## I'm helpin' you, huh?
Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.

## What do you think?
I think you better put him on ice, man.

## If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.

## Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.

## Now, where we goin', convict?
Mission District. Gonna find us an Indian.

## Last night, two nights ago, three?
Last night.

## You have a good time?
Sure. Then we had a fight this morning.

## Well?
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.

## Back you up? Now why would I wanna do that?
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...

## Hey, you wanna bet?
I got two problems. Number one, I'm not playin' games. Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.

## What are you talkin' about?
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail. And whatever it is, you're part of it.

## You made that move, huh?
While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.

## Yeah, right. You want to try again?
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.

## How much?
Half a million.

## We split 50-50?
Not likely, convict.

## You gonna let me keep any of it?
Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.

## In the trunk of a car. A lot better than under a mattress, right?
Right, partner.

## You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.

## What?
Musta got some primo bondsman.

## Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.

## Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?
I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...

## Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
If they don't tell me what I need to know...

## Doesn't it get... Tiring?
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...

## Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
That was in style a couple years back, man.

## Where's luther?
Be polite. Say hello. This is Candy.

## What about Ganz?
We missed.

## Tell me something. Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...

## You sure that's the reason?
Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...

## Why?
Luther's on the move...

## Notice something funny about that bus?
Yeah. It missed the last four stops.

## Hey, how'd my car get here?
I had it impounded. Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.

## Do I get to kiss her too?
If she's right, and if you don't screw up.

## Partnership?
Well, you got to admit we come a long way.

## You okay?
Yeah. But I wasn't there for a second.

## And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..

## No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook? Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.

## Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
Yeah. It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.

## Yeah?
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.

## What the bell happened?
I lost them, that's what happened.

## How did they get away?
They ran. As fast as they could. Caught a train.

## Which one pulled the trigger?
The Indian. I was about 30 yards away.

## You couldn't get to him?
What a screw-up.

## Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
I didn't have the time.

## Where the Christ do you think you're going?
I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.

## The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?
Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.

## Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
Every last bit of it. The big guy's room was empty.

## Who are all these?
They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.

## Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong. He was in on the same job.

## I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking. Can we find them?
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.

## Nothing came in for me yet? No calls?
Nothing.

## I'm heading out. How about you?
I got to wait for a call.

## Jesus Christ. Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
I'm not paid to take your personal calls. He was in some bar. .. off duty.

## I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.

## Who gives a fuck what you think?
Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.

## When? How?
I dunno ... he's gonna call me...

## What am I wanted for?
I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...

## This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
I still don't think it's loaded.

## What's wrong with that?
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.

## What'd you do?
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.

## Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.

## Hey, you know what I really think?
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.

## What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?
Maybe you ought to buy me one.

## You sure you want me to?
Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...

## Jack, are you okay?
Sure, okay, fine, no problem... See, there's this kid in jail ... First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows ...

## Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.

## I'm at work, asshole. Where else?
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.

## Jack? What was that?
Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...

## I can see that. Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit. What happened?
We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...

## You real down?
I've been better...Dead end. No Ganz, no Indian.

## How do you know?
Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type. But this Indian...

## What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.

## So what?
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.

## Whaddya think?
What do I know? I'm just a bartender.

## How'd they take it back at headquarters?
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.

## Where is he?
Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...

## Who the hell are you?
Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.

## How would you know?
Hey, two days with him is enough.

## What do you want? What's goin' on?
Shut up.

## What do you want?
Keep stallin'.

## How hot are they?
Hot? Hey, they're not even room temperature.

## How ya doin'?
Can't complain.

## We'll follow you. Take it slow,okay?
Sure, right.

## You want that Indian to snap her neck?
Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me...

## When?
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.

## Rosalie, you okay?
What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.

## How you doing, man?
Not bad, not bad.

## You want to go outside?
Naw, right here's okay.

## You sure?
I'm sure. Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.

## How about some ammo?
It's loaded... I got some shells in here.

## How much?
This is clean shit. No serial numbers and never been used...

## Don't mess with me. How much?
Five bills.

## Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?
Give it back.

## Corn-i-Lius?
At your service.

## What're you laughing about?
Napoleon... small.

## I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
The case..with the stones... Where is it?

## ...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...

## Why? What's wrong with me?
...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.

## ...would you like a drink?
No thank you.

## That's me. But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
She dropped in on me... holding this.

## Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
Who are you?

## They all like this in your family, father?
She's an exception..

## Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.

## Excuse me! Just one thing! She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
It means, \"Never without my permission\".

## Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..

## What kind of mission?
We have to save the world.

## What are you doing?
Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.

## Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
Leeloo's in trouble?

## And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
That's what I'm saying.

## We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
One more reason to shoot first eh?

## And then?
And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it.

## Is there anything that can stop it?
Yes..thank God..

## But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
White turns to black. Light to Dark. Life to Death. For all eternity.

## What are we going to do?
Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.

## Where's Leeloo?
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.

## Who?
The Fifth Element... The Supreme Being... Your wife...

## Yeah?
Hey bud! Finger here.

## How do I look?
Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.

## So, just how big was this fare?
5'7\", green eyes... long legs... great skin... perfect..

## Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...
...'Scuse me?

## I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured...
Vito Cornelius?

## ...What's your name?
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.

## Hey, that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
...Leeloo.

## Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.

## Yes ma..
...Hello?

## I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
...Not yet.

## 30 seconds...
Hello?

## Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
6... 5...

## Found it?
Uh... not really.

## I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal?
Crystal.

## ...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?
Yeah, very big, a giant.

## You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?
Got it...

## Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?
Not without Leeloo.

## Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?
I'll be right back.

## Solid little jobs, aren't they?
Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.

## Is that all?
Yeah... then I sighed... like this.

## What mission?
To save the world.

## Just one... why me?
Two, Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.

## And the third one?
You're the only one left alive...

## You have won the annual Gemini contest and a trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two. Congratulations. Here are your tickets.
Don't you open your messages?

## Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
I'm not going.

## Why not?
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.

## You hear that?
Cornelius..

## Finished what?
Learning language.

## Which one?
Uh...

## You get that off the screen?
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.

## Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...

## Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?
Because...

## Not going to open?
Uh..

## It's not?
You gotta push the little yellow button...

## This is all that survived?
Actually only one cell survived..

## Have you identified it?
Talk English Doc.

## Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
We put it through the cellular hygiene detector. The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.

## This thing solid?
An elephant couldn't crack it.

## And the Stones? Did you find them in the wreckage?
The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.

## They just landed in the desert.
...What do you mean?

## Staedert, do you read me?
I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .

## Is that better?
Perfect, Mr. President.

## Staedert? What's going on? Did you destroy it?
I'm about to, Mr. President.

## Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
Got it.

## How's our deal coming along?
Fine, just fine! I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now. But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.

## What's this... have you been smoking... ?
Smoking? I'm not smoking.

## Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
Okay, I believe you.

## How's the detective business?
Business was fine. I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.

## You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
Sure. I'll call the guy.

## I'm not using him again for anything. He was worthless. You have bridge here Saturday?
Betty's out of town so we're playing next week.

## Why the gun?
I'm not gonna need it. I won't even wear it. It's a precaution. Don't worry about me.

## Hello?
Amy, it's me. Listen very carefully..

## Tom? Where have you been... ?
Amy, just listen. Take Cindy and get out of the house. Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...

## ... What's going on?
Just do it, Amy, please, go.

## What's going on, Tom? What happened?
I can't tell you, Amy. You know I can't. You have to trust me...

## Why haven't you called? Why don't you answer your phone?
I don't know. I'm sorry...

## You're sorry? What was I supposed to think?
You owe me an explanation. You can't treat me like this.

## You couldn't?
You don't understand...

## Who are you calling?
Mrs. Christian.

## What?
She's all I've got. She's the only witness.

## What are these?
Mixed hard bondage. Rape films. Sick shit. Buy five, get one free.

## Anything harder?
There's nothing harder.

## Snuff?
What you see is what I got, mister.

## What do you want?
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.

## What are you talking about?
The loop! The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?! This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...

## It's an honor to meet you. Thank you for seeing us.
Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible. Why are you bothering me with this... ?

## What can I do for you today?
I'd like to commission a work. I'm a great admirer of yours.

## Flattering. And, who's your colorful little chum?
A fellow investor.

## And they are?
I want to watch you work.

## You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it. I'd like to take your picture. You don't mind?
I'd rather you didn't.

## What's the problem?
I'm camera shy.

## You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
Those are two different kinds of trust. Thank you for your time. I hope we can do business.

## Machine's in?
He's in. It will be his pleasure.

## Where's that?
Brooklyn. Don't be late.

## You brought the money?
Right here.

## Where are the women?
They should be here any minute.

## Hmm? Oh, the knifes? They're just props. Nice, aren't they?
Sure.

## Shut up, cunt! Do exactly as I say, or I'll put this arrow through your throat.
Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?

## You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?
I remember him.

## Friend of yours?
Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...

## Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...

## Is that him?
Put the gun down, take the handcuffs. Handcuff yourself to the bed.

## You got the guts, tough guy? Gonna kill us all, is that it?
You betrayed us.

## What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?
Call me Tom.

## Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
I figured you share information.

## Why don't they come to me?
I'm not so sure about this.

## Any good?
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days. I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.

## You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
It's good what you're doing.

## Yeah, who's this?
I know what you did.

## What?
I know what you did.

## What the fuck are you.. ?
You killed that girl and you put it on film. You and your pals, you're fucked. You fucked up real good.

## What's he talking about?
One million dollars, Dino. How much did he tell you he had...

## How'd you find me here?
I don't know...

## How much did he pay you?
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.

## That's all? Thirty each. That's all it took for you to murder her?
It was a lot of fucking money.

## Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?

## Why?
Because we're going there.

## You enjoy it?
Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that. It was just something I was doing for money.

## What did you do with her body?
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.

## Do it! Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore. You think it's so easy?
Easy enough for you.

## What do you want? You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ?
You know how my tapes sell. People eat this stuff up.

## The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie. Where do you get this stuff?
Look, you cocksucker...

## You are a private investigator?
That's right.

## That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me. You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe. How'd you find me?
You're making me very angry.

## You're asking me why?
I'm asking.

## Isn't it incredibly obvious?
Enlighten me.

## Because he could. He did it because he could. What other reason were you looking for?
You almost went over your limit.

## Big date tonight?
Yeah... guess so.

## Pardon me?
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.

## Remember me?
Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right? Told you you would.

## How long you been working there?
Three, four years.

## What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
Max.

## From Pennsylvania. P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.

## How much do you make now?
Four hundred a week, off the books.

## Here's my number if you need it... When can you start?
Wake up, pops. Your education begins tonight.

## How old are you?
Twenty-five.

## I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed. What are you talking about?
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.

## I see a ring on your finger. You have any kids?
A daughter.

## So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
Good question.

## A weirdo making S+M films? Who'd have thought it?
His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore. Definitely not for the squeamish.

## Where does he sell it?
Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look. He'll also do commissions, for enough money...

## Well, I'm in New York now. What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
I'm a working stiff, pops.

## You want me to come out there and play private eye?
Consider it. Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts. I'll call back.

## Who is he?
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...

## Who is he, his name?
You don't need to be here.

## \"Devil\" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.
What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you?

## What's next?
I'm trying to figure that out myself. I have to see Machine without his mask.

## Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
Nope.

## What's this?
It's money. People use it to purchase goods and services.

## Have a pleasant evening. Will you have tea, Mister Welles?
Thank you.

## Pittsburgh?
He succeeded.

## Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?
I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to. Other than that, there's never any reason.

## Do you want to tell me what you found?
Cash, stock certificates, and this...

## Will you watch it and see for yourself?
Of course. But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.

## Hello... ?
I'm here.

## Do you think the film could have cost that much?
Okay.

## Send it to me through the post office like we arranged. No return address. You dug this up all by yourself?
You told me to look, so I looked.

## Hello?
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.

## I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
I've been ordered into bed. The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.

## Nothing more than a bother. Have you any news for me?
I've made progress. I'm in Manhattan. Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.

## How will I get it to you?
If you have a pencil and paper, I'll tell you how to send it.

## Yes... ?
Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...

## I don't understand, who are... ?
Yes, but...

## Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me. He didn't call?
No.

## They hired you. You're like, a private detective?
That's exactly what I am.

## So, she didn't leave a note? She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?
No.

## What was she running from?
I don't know.

## If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask. Your husband... he committed suicide?
Yes.

## Why do you think he did it?
It got to be too much for him.

## You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter... Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
I didn't mean to...

## People remember me from the news. Can you drive me back now?
Of course.

## Are you religious?
No.

## What?
There wasn't one. The police looked.

## Do you think the police did a good job?
I don't know. I think so.

## Will you let me look?
My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...

## You were right. I didn't find anything. I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?
Yes.

## Hello... ?
Mrs. Mathews? It's Thomas. Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...

## What are you talking about... ?
She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...

## What... ?
Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.

## Who is this... ?
Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...

## Who are you?
They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...

## Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
They murdered her, Mrs. Mathews, I'm sorry. It happened a month after she ran away. She's been dead all this time...

## Do you know what happened to her?
I'm trying to find out. She was a runaway. I'm looking into it for her parents.

## What is this?
Those are her belongings.

## Her belongings?
That's her suitcase. I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.

## Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?
I'll do what I can.

## None too discreet, is he?
No, sir, he is not.

## He's an imbecile. I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...

## Alright. May I have your phone number, area code first?
No, you may not.

## What?
The mirror. You can't see yourself in it.

## What's wrong?
Kincaid and Joey died last night.

## You alright?
Kristen...

## I heard you screaming. Was it a bad one?
It was bad.

## Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
I can't find him.

## My mom taught me when I was little. Did you ever hear of the dream master?
Sounds like a game show host to me.

## Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?
I daydream. you have to dream about some place fun. Remember you're in control.

## How'd you learn so much about dreams?
When they're all you have, you kinda become an expert.

## You what?
When I used to have nightmares. I brought my friends in to help me. Until they all started dying.

## Kristen, what happened?
You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.

## You in a hurry?
I gotta get to the library before it closes. Killer physics test.

## Then you saw him, too?
Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together. Look...

## You're his sister, right?
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen. She wasn't feeling very well.

## I've been working double shifts.
\"In her dream\"?

## Extra money, huh?
Look, you know why, you just don't believe me.

## How long have you been awake?
Three days.

## Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?
Not really.

## Is there something we can do?
I don't think so. I guess this is my own war.

## Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
Yeah, right. Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room. Adults won't see it. They can't.

## Then what else can we do?
Try what other kids did. Keep each other awake. We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.

## Who?
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.

## What the hell was that?
Debbie. She's gone. I've...collected her, like the others.

## So what's up? What'd I miss?
She told us the story of Freddy. It's a town legend. He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.

## So?
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.

## About Freddy?
What else? You ever look over this town's history? Not a safe place to be a teenager. Anyway, if I'm next, watch your back.

## Something the matter with the cuisine?
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.

## What's wrong with me?
Your distraught. It'll help...

## Something wrong with the stairs?
Avoid-all-contact-day.

## What?
When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.

## I told you you can't help. This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.
What is it?

## Yeah. I guess so... What happened?
What I what? Well, I've thought about it. I plan to keep him.

## Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?
It's lonely in there, in my room.

## How did you know that?
I could tell you were sad. I just wanted to see if you were all right.

## Hi, you don't look very well. Are you feeling all right?
Been having bad dreams.

## Is that who you're waiting for?
No...

## Who says I don't like you?
My friend, with the funny hand.

## Mommy...?
Come on downstairs. He won't hurt you. He needs us both.

## Where is he?
He's inside you, where he hides.

## What do you mean?
It's where he hides out. Inside. That's how he found me.

## But how...?
He says it's easy. Especially with sad people. With closed-off people.

## Okay, babe. What's the matter?
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.

## About him?
No. Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control. For the first time since...all that. I'm scared.

## Where are we going?
To take a picture.

## You sure you don't want a ride to work?
It's just across the park.

## How was the meeting?
Sobering...

## Since when are you such a smart shopper?
Since my little girl became a mom...

## You disappointed in me?
No, I'm not. I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.

## Have you visited the little boy on my floor? Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?
There aren't any little boys on your floor.

## Did everyone call everyone?
They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.

## What's that got to do with it?
When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so. End of story.

## I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?
Why don't you two stick to reality.

## You had me scared on the phone. What's wrong with the baby?
I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.

## I really think you need to calm down now, okay?
Goddamn it, Yvonne! You don't just run away from this guy! He finds you in your dreams.

## Are you alright?
Yeah...So that's him. And you're not crazy.

## You think that's the place she's buried?
If they actually bothered to bury her.

## What?
Jacob. We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.

## Greta, come on. One burger with me?
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.

## Mark, are you okay?
Yeah. I'm just aces.

## I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today. Could we interest you in someone else?
Nobody thinks that.

## That's their problem.
Who's Jacob?

## Meaning?
They couldn't prove it. No body! Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.

## Empty plot. Memorial stone. Vacant. They never did put her under. Cool, huh?
Poor woman...

## Next life. Oh, what's that?
My undying love. Have some.

## You know my mother -- get real. What about Alice's?
He's right. Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.

## Who?
Oh man! I could've gone all night without looking at that.

## Have another one, sounds like you need it.
I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?

## Naah, I'm done. Got to be on shift in a couple hours. Aren't you going in?
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.

## All of us. Right?
Dan. And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne. You've been practicing.

## Vomit?
Faint.

## You, too?
He invited me to his house last night.

## How is he - ?
It was moderate. He'll be all right. But it was out of the question, his coming along.

## And they thought you could re- place the Skipper?
Your 'out.' This came for you.

## My father! He's not - ?
Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.

## But if they do?
I guess.

## A lot of people think like that.
So?

## Cyclops?
Sounds like it! Distress call, from a small freighter, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. One mayday, then...nothing.

## Let's get back to work, and maybe we will be, soon.
Yeah?

## Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
We'll have to look for them later.

## Here - keep these. It wants me to come alone.
Well?

## What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
Get ready. We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard.

## Is there any way out of it?
Seems to be all around...

## Yes, Griff?
All internal repairs completed, and Frogmen report exterior damage minor.

## Something wrong?
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.

## It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
Why do you say that?

## Under water?
As ready as we can be! I'll report to the Skipper.

## You're sure it's Cyclops?
Take a look.

## Nothing we can do, now.
What's the running time?

## What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
Point of view is everything. To us, your form of life is ugly as we appear to you.

## Why not me? What am I - the closing act?
On the contrary. I want you - unharmed - perfect.

## It is a living thing. When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.
Why?

## To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?
Obviously.

## See what?
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.

## Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
No. Black.

## Are you alright, Wade?
Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.

## Who?
Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.

## You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.

## About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.

## Has anybody offered to buy it?
As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.

## Twombley involved?
No.

## What are you boys up to?
Same old shit.

## LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
Tell me.

## How soon?
This spring.

## No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
Yes.

## Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
Oh.

## Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?
Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.

## Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.

## Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.

## If you get it?
Yeah.

## Yeah?
Drafted by the Red Sox.

## You played for the Sox?
Double A. New Britain.

## Safety on?
Yeah.

## Where's that gun you were bragging on today?
No brag. Just fact.

## Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems.

## How'd you get the job?
Gordon, he's always got some angle working. He wants to keep Twombley happy, I'm his boy.

## Like you and Gordon?
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.

## Where'd Twombley get shot?
In the chest.

## You stayed away?
Yeah.

## What blood?
On your sleeve.

## I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.

## Saw him do it?
What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.

## Lawford?
Out of this fucking job. This job sucks. Working outside in the winter sucks.

## Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
Open the door. We're late.

## Do what?
You know.

## Break stuff?
Yeah. It's stupid.

## Was it funny?
To us it was.

## What are you talking about?
I just think you used to be bad.

## No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
No. She doesn't talk about you anymore.

## What then?
It's stupid.

## No what?
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.

## What? You called Mommy? Just now?
Yes.

## Jesus, why?
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.

## Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
See, I knew you'd be mad.

## Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.

## She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
Yes.

## Are we going in this?
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.

## Pop?
Grandpa. My father. It's his.

## How about a Big Mac?
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.

## C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
No.

## What do you want, then?
Nothing.

## I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?

## Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?
Okay.

## What are you sorry for?
I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.

## Where's the plow?
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.

## Huh?
At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.

## You don't want the extra police pay?
I'm not saying that.

## What's the hurry?
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.

## Huh?
I figured you already heard.

## Fuck. Turn it off. All you heard was there was some kinda accident?
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.

## You mean Twombley?
Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

## You want me to follow them to Littleton?
What the fuck. My day's already ruined. Give me the keys. You can go back with Jack. You still got a shitload of plowing to do.

## Something bugging you?
Yeah. A few things.

## How you holding up, Wade?
I'm fine, fine.

## You Rolfe? I remember you from high school. You're a teacher now? Harvard?
Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.

## On what you pay me?
Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.

## What do I have to do for it?
Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.

## So?
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.

## You? Why?
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.

## Want to buy?
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.

## I won't. You interested?
Maybe.

## You and Mel Gordon?
Could be.

## You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves. Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
Yeah.

## She's grown up some, hasn't she?
Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It looks like you've won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for Christ's sake.

## You ever come to your father's grave anymore?
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.

## Wait there. She'll be right out. Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?
Yeah, lots.

## Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love. You won't get away with it.

## Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.

## Did you get his number?
I know who it is.

## Good. Who?
Mel Gordon.

## How's she doing?
Okay. She's fine.

## You okay?
Yeah.

## You okay?
Yeah.

## About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
Forget it.

## I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
You don't mean that.

## Wade! How can you even think such a thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that, shoot Twombley on purpose?
Money.

## The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.

## What way?
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.

## Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?
Alright. I'll think about it.

## Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
I know your parents.

## Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.

## Think they're alright?
Of course! I would've heard.

## Wade.
How?

## What happened?
Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.

## What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.

## Going somewhere, Margie?
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.

## You're not using it today?
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.

## Maybe Wade should take a look at it. Your pipes'll freeze. Wade, would you do that?
Coffee's perked.

## Is...? She's dead then?
It makes me sad.

## Can --?
Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze.

## Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
How's that?

## What the hell are you talking about?
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.

## Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--

## I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
He's asleep. We were up very late.

## Something about my father?
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.

## Can't it wait, then?
Take care, Wade.

## What?
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.

## Jack?
The other guy.

## Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?
It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.

## He got his deer yet?
Sleeping.

## From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.

## We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
Yeah.

## Where's Ma?
She's coming.

## Is there something wrong with the phone?
In the living room.

## Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.

## Wade?
There was something. It happened up your way.

## Who?
Twombley.

## You think Jack shot him?
Well, it was an accident.

## Huh?
The night before the shooting.

## How was she?
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.

## Who?
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.

## What happened?
A divorce lawyer. A custody lawyer. You know, 'cause of Jill.

## Haven't you already done a bit of that?
No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.

## Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
No thanks. I don't drink.

## Well, do you still plan to get married?
I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.

## Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.

## Want to know what I think happened?
Find them everywhere.

## Which is?
That it wasn't an accident.

## Then who shot him?
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.

## They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
I don't know. You tell me.

## Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.

## I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.

## Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
It may have happened, but not the way you said.

## You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.

## Wade, are you alright?
But you gotta hear this. You won't believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in his office.

## For what?
It's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times.

## You don't want to say hi to your father?
I'm sure he's busy.

## Don't you even want to ask?
Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.

## Back at The Fishbowl?
I know, Mom. It was great... really.

## No, it's okay. After all, he is the President, right?
When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.

## Some kids were teasing you?
That's not really the point.

## Yes dear?
I'm sorry I was so mean to you earlier.

## Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
Yeah. Do you know what the word &quot;asshole&quot; means.

## That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
Fuck off, you stupid asshole.

## How was... ...the ballet?
It was the experience of a lifetime.

## Been better, Dad... You?
Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...

## Did we warn them off?
Yes. They refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails.

## Do you see the maintenance panel?
Got it.

## Who's flying the fucking plane?
I'm doing what I can.

## Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
Got it.

## How we doing, Colonel?
We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.

## Can we do that?
We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.

## They still have the President, it's past their deadline and they haven't called. What do you think it means?
Like any good poker player, they're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard.

## The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
To swear you in as President.

## Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?
Yes, Mr. President.

## Why?
Because it is my duty.

## The rest of the secret service?
Dead.

## How many others killed?
Nine.

## Who did this?
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.

## why did they do that?
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.

## How?
Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.

## Where are we now?
Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.

## We copy. Stand by... Tower?
Tower, here.

## A dubious distinction, no?
I guess it depends on your perspective.

## And all these rooms here?
Conference rooms, though some have other functions. The one up front doubles as an emergency medical center.

## How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
Scared. We're scared.

## What do you want with us?
Now, or he dies, please.

## What do you know of my husband?
I know he left you behind.

## Why? Do you enjoy it?
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.

## You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?
You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.

## You'll do it?
Yes, I'll do it. Just leave my family alone.

## Twenty minutes?
You heard me. You. Congress and cabinet heads.

## Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?
Gravity.

## Can't it wait?
No, Mr. President. It can't.

## What?
I miss you. And I miss her.

## How did your speech go?
Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign.

## Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
I don't know why you stayed.

## What are you doing?
Flying the plane.

## Excuse me?
The fax machines.

## Where are we sending it?
White House Situation room.

## Did they say anything about my family?
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.

## What's going on?
AGENT We're under attack.

## Where's my family?
AGENT We're handling it, sir.

## who can I say is calling?
This is the President.

## Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....

## No, no. I'm fine. What did the Speaker say?
He and the NRA don't like the wording.

## Did we tape the Duke game?
I said it's not worth the fight. Steward, please.

## I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
Shepherd.

## A MiG? Where the hell are we?
Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.

## How long's it been since you flew, sir?
Twenty-five years.

## What?
I just wish it was that simple.

## What's the story?
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...

## Did you feel that?
Yes I did...

## What is it, Mary?
Um... Do you people scream right when you... you know.

## Sir?
You better take this.

## Ted, what's wrong?
Ask Simon.

## Elaine, what happened to us?
Eat this spaghetti, Ted. It'll make you feel a lot better.

## Who's that, Ted?
Sammy Davis Junior. Terrible car accident. He hasn't been the same since.

## Ted! What are you...?
I have to get in there. I have to stop this flight.

## I've never used the word insane, Ted.
What are you doing, Ted?

## What word would you use, Elaine?
Ted, there's no time to explain.

## What will happen to him, Ted?
The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds. He'll roast like a pig on a spit.

## Are you afraid?
Not when I'm with you, Ted.

## What can I do, Doctor Rumack?
You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.

## Is that a good sign, Doctor?
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.

## Is he making any progress, Doctor?
Yes -- last week that pile of mud was only this high.

## So mentally ill?
Meet me onboard, sweetheart. I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.

## Have you got it straightened out now?
I think so.

## Can't we change course?
We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.

## Your career! What about the lives of those people out there. Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved?
Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends! You'll die out there.

## I see. What do you think our alternatives are?
We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system.

## Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
Go ahead.

## Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?
We'll have to check, Jimmy. It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.

## Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
It's going to be terrific. A whole new world, new kids to play with.

## Come on up, Jimmy. Say, that's some puppy. What's his name?
Scraps.

## Can I hold him?
Sure.

## Do you like it when Scraps sleeps on his back, Jimmy?
Take this, Joey. It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.

## What...?
Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people.

## What?
That's right, Joe. Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.

## You're sure?
I'm sure.

## Sixteen 'C', why?
He's carrying a bomb.

## What should I say?
Anything. Just don't let Salucci think we're onto him.

## Captain Oveur?
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.

## Do you think it's necessary to explain everything?
Good to be aboard, gentlemen.

## You folks need any help?
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.

## Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
Yes.

## Do you have an appointment, sir?
No, dammit. It's a matter of life or death.

## Are you on the Mercury mission?
That's right, Striker. And we're getting married when we return.

## Kurtz, you're drunk. Who's in command of this ship?
That damn computer has taken over. I'm getting out.

## Excuse me, are you alright? I noticed you talking to yourself. I'm a nurse. Can I be of some help?
Uh... oh, thank you. It's nothing.

## Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
Yes. He's dying a-n-d wants to be buried on Mercury.

## Thank you. Cream?
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.

## Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.

## But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
No. I'm all alone.

## Something about a plane with no pilot?
Surely you can't be serious.

## ...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.
I am serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?

## Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.

## Captain, how soon can we land?
I can't tell.

## Can't you take a guess?
Well...not for another two hours.

## What is it, Doctor? What's happening?
I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.

## Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?
That's right.

## We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
Yes. Yes, of course.

## A hospital? What is it?
It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.

## What was it we had for dinner tonight?
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.

## What did he have?
He had fish.

## Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?
He had fish, too.

## Just how serious is it, doctor?
Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.

## Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?
No.

## Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?

## Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?
You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.

## You expect me to believe that?
But if you'll just give me...

## Ted, what are you doing here?
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.

## What's the matter?
My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.

## Headquarters!? What is it?
Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.

## Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.

## What's his problem?
That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.

## What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit the fan.

## Yes?
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.

## See them, Elaine?
Uh-huh.

## Airsick?
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.

## Did you decide on a runway yet?
Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.

## How ya doing, honey?
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.

## Would either of you like another cup of coffee?
I will, but Jim won't.

## Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
Oh, it's nothing to be alarmed about. We'll get back to you very quickly.

## Huh?
Roger.

## Huh?
We have clearance, Clarence.

## No, why don't you take care ot it?
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.

## Yes?
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...

## Do you feel all right, sir?
Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.

## Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?
No. No thank you.

## The cockpit? What is it?
Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.

## Would you go up, please?
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.

## Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
You've got me all wrong. I don't charge money for something that I myself find pleasurable...

## You okay?
Yeah...

## You are Cassandra?
That's right.

## He's not here. Why ask me?
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.

## Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours. Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
You don't have squat.

## Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson. Forget you hip waders, big guy?
Lay off, asshole.

## William Harcourt?
Yes...

## I am George.
Here?

## Anyway, what's it matter to you if we think it's funny, right? Whatta you care?
Yes.

## What is wrong?
Well... yes, quite possibly.

## What's this? What's going on?
Nothing.

## And that fits?
Well... Yeah, it's rubber. It stretches.

## And still it fits?
Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.

## How the hell do you know that?
A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.

## Aw-right. What about the other guy?
She didn't know him. But she said her son might.

## Did you talk to him?
He has not been home since that day. But she told me where to find him.

## Who said that?
At the end of the bar.

## Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?
Uh, Matthew...

## You know that guy?
From quarantine, when my people first arrived here. He and I were housed together.

## How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
Yeah, sure. I knew that...

## I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit. How long did it take you to learn English?
Three months. We learn quickly. We adapt. It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.

## Which one is that? Raw what?
This is mole. It's good.

## I'll bet. Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?
Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked.

## So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?
Ss'loka'. It means literally \"small but intelligent creature\". It loses much in the translation.

## Who is he?
Todd Watson. The assistant manager.

## When will Strader return?
I believe he is probably lying.

## So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?
My wife? She worries about me.

## You are married?
Was. Divorced.

## She's going to divorce me.
Yeah, go home. Get some sleep. You do sleep, don't you?

## George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
She's very progressive. I'm certain she's considering it.

## Stop the car.
To the... to the beach?

## Why?
Please, I must get out here.

## What was that about?
Nothing.

## ... and Porter ran a piece of shit mom-and-pop mini-mart. So what the hell's the connection?
You must leave me alone on this.

## How potent?
Like your cocaine, I suppose. The \"high\" lasts several hours. We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.

## We? You've taken it?
We all did.

## Jesus, this is major. Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
Your people don't know about this part of out past. And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.

## No, George -- you're missing the point. The drug is evidence. We need to have the evidence, ya know?
Uh, George...

## Where is the drug? Where have they taken it?
George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones...

## Why? What's the big goddamn deal?
Fuck procedure.

## Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.

## How do I look?
You look very good.

## What is it?
Casull .454 Magnum. You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.

## We think he could'a been involved, yeah. You know him?
To be honest, it's hard to say. I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.

## Who else can I ask around here?
Wait. You know who it looks like? Yeah. Anderson. Uh... James Anderson. He isn't in today. He took the afternoon off.

## That where Anderson worked?
Yes it is. Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there. I don't know how these fellas do it.

## Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
For you, anything.

## Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?
Sure. Just a minute.

## Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already? Let's try again-- Is your name Porter?
Ss'kya'ta'.

## One of the two men was Hubley, right? What about the other one? Did you know him?
Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.

## You took this gut out, too, didn't you?
Yeah.

## You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?
You mean the Blob? They're finishing up now.

## What kind of test?
Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.

## Yeah, Sykes?
Captain. I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.

## You?
Granger and Pitts are already on it.

## What?
Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay? But--

## You got your vest?
Of course. Right in the trunk of the car.

## Would you, Sir?
Can't lock up...

## Say again? All after incinerators?
I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis. It seems to be metabolizing. He should wake up soon.

## Could it be intelligent?
That's it. See it? Emergency venting.

## And it's too late to shut it down?
I'm afraid so. The crash did too much damage. The overload is inevitable, at this point.

## What?
I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to. I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.

## All right. Let's get on it. What'll you need?
It's going to be closer. You better get going.

## Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...
HOW MUCH TIME?

## Have they located my daughter yet?
Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...

## Is she...?
Amanda Ripley-McClaren. Married name, I guess. Age, sixty-six ...at time of death. Two years ago. I'm sorry.

## That's right.
What about you? What's your interest in this?

## Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
It's all I could get. Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything. Days off are worse.

## What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
If I go.

## You never said anything about an android being here! Why not?
Well, it didn't occur to me. It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.

## That the atmosphere processor?
Uh-hunh. One of thirty or so, all over the planet. They're completely automated. We manufacture them, by the way.

## What rank? I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
Why not?

## This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command. Right?
Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division. Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes. Set up for life.

## You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?
I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.

## Still nothing from the colony?
Dead on all channels.

## What's he scanning for?
PDT'S. Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.

## How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?
Thirty-eight...simulated.

## Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?
Where are your parents? You have to try...

## What is it?
I don't know.

## How do you feel?
All right, I guess. One hell of a hangover. Look, Ripley... I...

## Yes, Hicks?
Hudson, Sir. He's Hicks.

## Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
All we know is that there's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved.

## How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
...We're coming in.

## Alive?
Unknown. But, it looks like all of them. Over at the processing station...sublevel 'C' under the south tower.

## We're not making that out too well. What is it?
Outstanding. Then all we need's a deck of cards. All right, let's move like we got a purpose.

## I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
Maybe we got 'em demoralized.

## Poor bastard.
The corner! Ready?

## How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?
About seventeen days.

## Now many?
Can't tell. Lots. D gun's down to twenty. Ten. It's out.

## Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others. You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
If it comes to that, I'll do us both. Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.

## What's this?
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.

## No. Have you?
Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.

## Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?
Yeah, bullshit. Watch us.

## Uh, what's next?
We need the other drop-ship. The on one the Sulaco. We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.

## What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end. Why can't we use that?
Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there. Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.

## They're right on us. Vasquez, how you doing?
Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.

## And how are we today?
Terrible.

## Bad dreams again? Do you want something to help you sleep?
No.. I've slept enough.

## What did you say?
Newt. My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.

## What about me?
I don't want you for a friend.

## Why not?
Because you'll be gone soon, like the others. Like everybody. You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone.

## You promise?
Cross my heart.

## And hope to die?
I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze.

## The 'maze'? You mean the air ducts?
Yeah, you know. In the walls, under the floor. I was the ace. I could hide better than anybody.

## I guess we're not leaving, right?
I'm sorry, Newt.

## Why do they tell little kids that?
Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.

## Did one of those things grow inside her?
I don't know, Newt. That's the truth.

## Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
No, it's different, honey.

## Did you ever have a baby?
Yes. A little girl.

## Where is she?
Gone.

## Wah...? Where are...?
Sssh. Don't move. We're in trouble.

## DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
Sure. Go left.

## Mommy...Mommy?
Right here, baby. Right here.

## Are we going to sleep now?
That's right.

## Can we dream?
Yes, honey. I think we both can.

## How many colonists?
Indeed.

## What do you mean?
Maestro.

## And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
Yes.

## Is there a part for me?
No.

## How do you know?
Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.

## Where?
In a harem.

## What's that?
A brothel.

## What does he look like?
You might be disappointed.

## Why?
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.

## Well, what does it matter to you?
Nothing! He can marry who he pleases. I don't give a damn.

## What did you think of the music?
No, she's fine.

## What?
I assume she's the virtuoso in that department. There can't be any other reason you'd marry someone like that.

## No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?
Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore.

## And how will you make him keep it?
How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you, the more you take.

## Where?
I want to go back to Vienna.

## Why?
I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.

## Where?
We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.

## Why not?
Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.

## Do you think that's funny?
Don't be stupid.

## All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.

## My Stanzi - look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Come on now, confess, Papa. Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter?
Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.

## There's a young girl to see you.
May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?

## What does she want?
We'll have a little party. Come in. Come in. You know Herr Schikaneder? This is! a very nice girl.

## Yes, my love?
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.

## What?
Your father is dead.

## Who was that?
No one.

## What's that? Oh! Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi, who gave you this?
I'm not telling you.

## How charming. But why did he not come himself?
He's terribly busy, sir.

## Really?
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.

## Then he didn't send you?
No, sir. This is my own idea.

## Originals?
Yes.

## These are originals?
Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.

## Tonight?
Alone.

## Isn't it obvious?
It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.

## What are you doing here?
Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.

## Why you?
I was at hand.

## Am I interrupting something?
Not at all.

## Where's our friend?
He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.

## I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
He's doing his best.

## Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor. Who are you?
I see that you're expecting.

## When, may I ask?
And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.

## So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?

## Yes. He is a little strange.
Do you hear him? Do you?

## Really?
Ah, now! Here she comes.

## Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.

## Wine?
Just one year.

## Who was your teacher?
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.

## What a charming idea. May I see?
It's just a trifle, of course.

## May I try it?
Majesty.

## Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?
You do me too much honour, Sire.

## Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.

## Why not?
Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.

## Oh?
Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.

## Yes?
Molested, Majesty. Twice, in the course of the same lesson.

## Do you like this, Salieri?
In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.

## What? On one hearing only?
I think so, Sire, yes.

## It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?
Yes, indeed.

## So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.

## Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say? How shall one say, Director?
I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less.

## Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?
Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.

## Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?
Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether.

## Excuse me, but how old are you?
Ah! By all means.

## Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?
Yes, Sire.

## It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
Well, yes, I admit it is.

## Would you tell me why?
Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.

## Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?
I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.

## Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?
In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. Plain German. For plain people.

## Yes, what about him?
He's here.

## Of course, welcome! Welcome ten thousand times. Papa! my Papa!
Why are you here?

## Do you always live like this?
She's very tired, poor creature. You know me, I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.

## Don't you have a maid?
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.

## How is your financial situation?
Yes.

## How many?
I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.

## What's that?
Oh, let's not talk about it.

## Why not?
It's a secret.

## Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did.

## I will, sir.
Papa, is this your idea?

## Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?
Yes, thank you, sir.

## Do any pupils come to the house?
Not that I've seen.

## Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.

## Really? What is it he's writing?
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.

## Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?
I think I've found out about the money, sir.

## Where does he work?
In there, sir.

## Why? What has happened?
You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.

## What medicine?
I don't know. He has pains.

## Where?
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.

## Is he working?
I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.

## Are you Herr Mozart?
That's right.

## What?
They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.

## Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?
Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.

## What did he say? What did he say?
Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room.

## That kind of music should be punishable by death.
Well?

## Wonderful! He liked the monkey, didn't you?
Yes, well, it's all good fun.

## Animals?
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.

## What is this?
Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.

## What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
Yes.

## Can I see it?
No.

## Why not?
Because there's nothing to see.

## And which one of them do you want me to teach?
What? Ha-ha! That's funny - I like it. Which one, eh? You're a funny fellow. Hannah! Come this way.

## This is Herr Mozart, my dear. The young man Herr Salieri recommended to teach our Gertrude. Where is she?
I'm afraid I am.

## Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?
Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.

## Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.

## What for?
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.

## Really?
Mio caro Adone.

## So you are. How is your pretty wife?
She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.

## Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?
I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.

## Whom did they choose?
Herr Sommer.

## You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.

## Do you have a daughter?
I'm afraid not.

## Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.

## Ah. Italian?
Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.

## Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter?
It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.

## I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
Oh no! My wife took it out in time.

## Oh, Excellency, would you?
With all my heart, Mozart.

## What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
I think it's marvelous. Truly.

## It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?
I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.

## Yes?
I never knew that music like that was possible.

## What work?
A Mass for the dead.

## What dead? Who is dead?
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.

## Who are you?
I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.

## How long will you give me?
Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.

## What happened? Is it over?
Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.

## You mean she's not coming back?
You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.

## Do you mean that?
I do.

## What?
I'm too young to be so sick.

## Who?
The man. He's here.

## What man?
Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it.

## Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
Would you? Actually, you could.

## Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
A Mass. A Mass for the Dead.

## Where did I stop?
The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.

## So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
Consigned to flames of woe.

## A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
Oh, yes.

## We ended in F Major?
Yes.

## What time?
Common time.

## Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C. Con-fu-ta-tis. Second measure, fourth beat on D. Ma-le-dic-tis. All right?
Yes.

## First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
With the tenors.

## Also identical?
Exactly. The instruments to go with the voices. Trumpets and timpani, tonic and dominant.

## And that's all?
Oh no. Now for the Fire. Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.

## Do you have me?
I think so.

## Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
Oh no. I'm not tired at all.

## Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
I'm not leaving you.

## Oh? Have I seen it?
I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately.

## You mean in Turkey?
Exactly.

## Then why especially does it have to be in German?
Well not especially. It can be in Turkish, if you really want. I don't care.

## Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.

## What are you doing, Herr Director?
Taking out what you should never have put in.

## What is what?
Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.

## Is the Emperor angry with me?
On the contrary.

## Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.

## Who is on this committee?
I don't think it was really decided, Director.

## What do you want?
I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.

## So?
In the sight of God that is a sin.

## What do you want?
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.

## Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.

## Are they?
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.

## How well are you trained in music?
I know a little. I studied it in my youth.

## Where?
Here in Vienna.

## Well?
I regret it is not too familiar.

## I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.

## Ah - you've heard that?
All Vienna has heard that.

## Do you hear me?
He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.

## No? Was Mozart a good man?
My son, no one can speak for God.

## What?
Yes.

## I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.
What difference does that make?

## Yes?
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.

## You mean that play?
Exactly.

## He's setting that play to music?
Yes.

## Are you absolutely sure?
I've seen the manuscript.

## Where?
Never mind.

## What anger?
About the ballet.

## Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
Yes, in the third act.

## I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director?
For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.

## Oh yes, yes. And that was?
Ah.

## What? Who the devil are you?
WOMAN I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.

## What do you mean - now?
WOMAN Of course now. Right away, before I get any older.

## Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?
WOMAN Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.

## Who is she?
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.

## What does he want?
He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.

## Can we come in?
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.

## But he's all right?
Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.

## Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
Of course.

## Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?
The American? Yes, duck.

## You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?
I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.

## Dr. Hirsch?
Go about your duties.

## What exactly did he call out?
He said 'Jack'.

## What happened to them?
No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor.

## Did he say a wolf?
Yes, I believe he did.

## It's a full moon. Where is he?
At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...

## Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.

## Has his friend appeared to him again?
Yes.

## What did he say?
David says Jack comes to warn him.

## Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
Yes.

## And what else?
I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf.

## You've absolutely no idea where David might be?
No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.

## Dr. Hirsch?
Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.

## What shall we do?
Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.

## Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.

## The zoo? Is he rational?
Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.

## Is David acting strangely?
No, not really.

## Could you get here without any trouble?
Yes, I should think so.

## You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
He's fine. We'll come right over.

## Shall I send a car?
No, a cab will be faster.

## What shall we do?
Tea would be nice.

## David?
I doubt it. But it's something to do.

## I beg your pardon?
It was a wolf.

## What?
A wolf.

## Yes?
You haven't eaten your lunch.

## Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?
Call me David.

## Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.

## Will you give me a break?
You're a very beautiful girl.

## I was. What are you reading?
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.

## Do you like it?
I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.

## What do you dream about?
I dream of death mostly.

## How old are you?
That's not really a very proper question.

## How old are you?
Twenty-eight.

## Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
My best friend. My very best friend.

## Shall I read to you?
What? Oh, yes, please.

## Hello. You all right?
I'm sorry I woke you up.

## Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.

## What?
I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.

## How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
Not just a patient -- me.

## You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.

## All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
Now I'm embarrassed.

## Are you better now?
I'll let you know the next full moon.

## You're to be discharged tomorrow. Will you be all right?
My friend Jack was just here.

## I was dreaming again?
I would think so.

## Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
Of course.

## David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?
I was awake and he was in my room.

## Do me an enormous favor?
Anything.

## David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
Yeah, I do, but go to work.

## Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?
The next corner we can get a cab.

## David, what are you doing?
Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.

## What?
We had an argument. He's being silly.

## No what?
No.

## Feeling better?
No.

## How are we feeling tonight?
No.

## Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?
No.

## He all right?
Yes, I should think. He called out just now.

## Why on earth do you say that?
I looked.

## Has he been refusing food?
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.

## You did, did you?
This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.

## Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?
No, but we're about to.

## What time is it?
It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.

## Alex?
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.

## What are you going to see?
An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.

## Do you have bad dreams, too?
Some, everyone does.

## Bambi?
Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins.

## Where am I?
You're in a hospital in London.

## The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.

## Lunatic?
Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now. Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now.

## There were witnesses?
So they said.

## You've never had bad dreams before?
Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.

## Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?
I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.

## Did you see Jack?
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.

## Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
I really don't know.

## You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
Dr. Hirsch? I'd rather not be by myself.

## Are you cold?
Yes.

## Oh, I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place?
Well, I like it here.

## Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.

## Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
I don't know.

## We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
She says she 'likes me too much'.

## Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
That's a wolf's head.

## Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
That's not a spear. It's a pike.

## Shall we?
Hello.

## What about it?
It's a five-pointed star.

## What the hell was that all about?
I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.

## Beware the moon?
Come on, I'm freezing.

## What do you think was wrong?
I have no idea.

## Did you hear that?
I heard that.

## What was it?
Could be a lot of things.

## Yeah?
A coyote.

## Shit! David, what is that?
I don't know. Come on.

## Come on, where?
Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving.

## Plan?
Let's just keep walking.

## Oh shit. What is that?
A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away.

## See anything?
No.

## Jack?
Yeah.

## Where are we going?
I'll tell you when we get there.

## Are you going to help me up?
Nice to see you.

## Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.

## Rudy Levine the shmuck?
Life mocks me even in death.

## Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.

## What are you doing here?
I wanted to see you.

## What do you think?
I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.

## What can I say, Jack?
You don't have to say anything.

## Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
If I was still alive, I probably would.

## What about the zoo?
I want you to meet some people.

## How shall I do it?
I could hang myself.

## Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea?
No, thank you, Doctor.

## Why don't we ask him?
The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but I hardly think...

## What can we do to assist you?
Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you.

## Yes?
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.

## Excuse me. Yes?
Roger Mathison, Doctor.

## What here?
Campari and soda would do nicely.

## What's that?
Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.

## Do you have any hot soup?
No.

## Hot chocolate?
We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea.

## Then you have some hot tea?
No.

## I beg your pardon?
No, thank you.

## Has Mr. Kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors?
He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man.

## And what, Sergeant?
I don't rightly know, sir.

## Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
I want to know why .

## Oscar, what's the matter?
I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.

## No kidding?
No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.

## Matt?
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one ...

## He has?
Yeah.

## How much?
About twenty-four thousand.

## Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?
Yeah.

## Let me have ten bucks?
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.

## Whose death?
It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.

## Where you been?
Where do you think I've been? I took the baby for a stroll in the park.

## What's the matter, Charlie?
I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.

## Mr. Dickson in yet?
Not yet, Mr. Clark.

## Character, hmmpf! That's your idea?
Most of the creditors I know personally. I've seen them grow up in the community. I knew their fathers and mothers before them.

## What about?
We'll discuss that in the board room.

## I have everything I own in it. It's your bank as well as mine, isn't it?
Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.

## Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
That's very simple. I was home.

## Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.

## What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.

## You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes.

## Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?
Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you ...

## Me?
Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that.

## Line?
Whatever it is that makes you such a riot with women.

## Well, aren't you going to invite me?
You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.

## Don't you know?
My apartment.

## What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?
Yes, sir.

## Now?
Yes, now.

## Oh, yeah?
Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you.

## Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me. What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?

## John, how's your wife this morning?
Much better this morning, thank you.

## Wait a minute. How do you feel this morning?
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.

## Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
Yes.

## That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
Yes, of course.

## Tomorrow night?
All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.

## Happy now?
No.

## Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, you see, I ... I ...

## Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it?
I don't know.

## Ummm. Stalling, eh? Anything new?
Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room.

## Directors, eh? Long faces?
In Mr. Sampson's office.

## You want the rest of those numbers, Mr. Dickson?
Numbers? No, never mind.

## Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
Yes, sir.

## Yes?
Get Mrs. Dickson on the phone.

## Got my letter?
Yes, thank you.

## Mr. Dickson?
Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer at the Guaranty. He's going to take care of that mortgage for you ...

## Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?
I haven't any.

## You haven't got a uniform?
No, sir.

## My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
Why, I don't know.

## Well, well, well - got your uniform, eh?
Yes, sir.

## Looks good. How much did it cost?
I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me.

## And what's more, keep up the good work and who knows - some day you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk ... Not a bad thought, eh?
What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.

## I suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh?
I already told him I was home.

## Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Well ... uh ... I ...

## I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?

## Why pick on him ?
Yes.

## What time did this thing happen?
The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.

## All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
If he can do it, yes.

## Listen, Matt. If you don't tell the truth, I can't help you. Where were you last night?
You were right, Mr. Dickson! Brown didn't have anything to do with it. Here's your man.

## My wife? What's she got to do with you?
No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.

## Well, Sampson, what is it?
Here's the data on the Clyde deal.

## What are you talking about?
They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police.

## Did you get the case for the securities?
Yes, sir.

## Mine too?
Yes, sir. But soon as our money runs out, they'll mob the place.

## What'll we do?
We can't keep open till four o'clock. We haven't cash enough to last an hour.

## Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here.
Don't you think I know it?

## Is it safe?
Absolutely.

## Is that busy husband of mine busy?
He's at a board meeting.

## Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
No.

## A friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it?
No.

## Oh, you think I'm lying?
Yes.

## Say, I just heard the merger isn't going thru. Isn't that grand?
Yeah, swell.

## What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?
Yeah.

## Well ... ?
Yes, right in his office, the rat. I'd like to take a crack at that guy.

## What's keeping you?
Oh, Charlie again.

## Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right.
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?

## What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.

## Did you talk to him?
Yeah. I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone.

## Yes, why?
He was in the bank yesterday.

## He was here?
He came to see Mr. Cluett.

## Are you sure?
Yes, sir.

## What did you find out, Mike?
I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere.

## Never mind all that. What did you find out?
He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.

## Dude Finlay?
Yes, sir.

## Do you know this young man, Mrs. Halligan?
Sure I do. He has the best room in me house. The one with the fancy wallpaper.

## What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?
It was late, I know. The Dooley sisters was already in. They work at a show, you know.

## I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters ...

## Was it twelve o'clock?
Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause...

## It couldn't have been earlier?
No. It wasn't earlier because...

## Then who changed it?
I don't know.

## So you were home last night?
Yes.

## What time did you get in?
Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.

## Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
Yes.

## Then where were you?
You're carrying too much money on you, Hank. You better turn some in tonight.

## How are you fixed?
I'm okay, Matt.

## You've got enough?
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.

## Everybody in?
I guess so.

## Where's Charlie?
Charlie's upstairs as sore as a pup. He's out fourteen cents, and he can't find it.

## You can ride like that?
Sometimes a wound will kill.

## We got a problem here, brother?
Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.

## What?
Nope.

## How many of them did he kill?
Two.

## What?
Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...

## What you sayin' boy?
I think I recognize you.

## How?
I think I saw you leavin' by the front door just as I was coming in the back.

## Ride with me, cousin?
There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.

## You're not scared, are you?
Pick your fights, cousin. You taught me that.

## What is wrong with you?
In case we have to kill these sonofabitches, I don't want them to see us coming.

## You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
She got two of them.

## After all you did on our farm? You miss it, don't you Jesse?
The war? What, are you crazy? There are things I miss about it.

## But it was a whole lot of killing. Why should we miss that?
Yeah.

## So what do we do, General Lee?
Just like in the war. Harass their supply lines. We kill the railroad's men, they won't care.

## What will be?
Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.

## What are you saying?
Missed you, cousin.

## Where'd you get all these riders?
We didn't. Zerelda did. Turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw.

## Well?
I'm thinking...

## Cannon or Gatling?
Both would be nice.

## Which one, right or left?
The brown one.

## Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?
Cole, he didn't mean that.

## They gonna rush us?
They're just insurance in case we run.

## All right, all right. Jesse James never yelled at folk...
Of course! Uh, sir?

## Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.

## You're right, sir.
East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?

## Then why can't I go in there?
On account of we're robbing it.

## Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.

## Where the hell were you?
I had you covered. From back there.

## My little Web did that?
Pff. He jumped his horse clear over our heads, killed a dozen Union soldiers before they knew what hit them.

## Web died fighting?
Died a hero.

## What do you say, sir?
Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.

## He's going to be fine, right Daddy?
The bullet came out clean, but he lost a whole lot of blood. Praying wouldn't hurt.

## Distracting enough for you?
Pff. They hardly even noticed you.

## Such as?
You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.

## Frank, don't you have something to say?
You're doing just fine.

## What kind of story are they going to believe?
That just might work.

## \"Big and older\"?
Heard of him.

## What do you think?
Pinkertons. It's the railroad.

## Fine. How'd it go out here?
And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.

## I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare?
It's the scientific method. It's all the rage.

## Maybe it started out that way. But now...
The posters?

## A better life than the one you could have had with Zee?
We're drunk.

## They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.
You taking sides against me, now, Frank?

## Got any ideas, little brother?
Shoulda learned with Web. Made it look fun, made it look like an adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim.

## He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?
Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.

## A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.

## Yeah, Jimmy?
...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.

## So what was he?
I think... he was just a real interestin' fella to have around.

## How much of that story is true?
Everything but the boring parts.

## Did you kill Yankees?
A fair number, Ma.

## Say your prayers?
Ma, I'm glad to see you being nice to our Injun friend.

## Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
You were little Jesse James when you left.

## Jesse, are you awake?
Mmmm.

## Jesse, is that your hand?
Nuh-huh ...

## You're sick of my company?
No! I mean, of course not. No.

## What?
I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.

## So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?
Unfair. You are completely unfair.

## You didn't want to farm?
I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.

## Thank God you grew out of that. You did grow out of that, didn't you?
Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.

## You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
Not if I find the right girl.

## And what's this right girl like?
Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.

## Where will you find such a girl?
Little ones.

## Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?
Yep.

## Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
I've been planning on kissin' you for a very long time.

## Whose justice? Yours or God's? When will you stop?
When my name makes them cry in their sleep. When I've brought them to ashes.

## Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?
Now wait a minute. There are certain things that have to wait until after the wedding.

## I beg your pardon?
\"Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James.\" Only a dime in the hotel lobby.

## Jesse, have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble, your accent gets all farm boy?
Aw, shucks, ma'am...

## What?
If you don't see it, it's not real...

## Tennessee?
I'll explain on the way.

## So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
That's the idea.

## Did you order our houses burned down?
Not that day. I am guilty of many things, but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains and Parker, that day.

## Last February?
Mmm.

## Yes?
The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.

## Was it worth it?
Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.

## The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable. \"Jesse Woodson James.\" Jesse James? The Jesse James?
Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.

## Right here in church?
Communion.

## You okay, Jesse?
Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.

## Jim, you been with a girl yet?
Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm.

## Hell yeah! I been with... Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
I think so.

## It's his money. He's putting up the payroll out of his own fortune. You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains, don't you Jesse?
... too young for whisky...

## Really?
I hope I'm not being too forward.

## Thank you, Miss -- ?
Lyla Devereux.

## Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.

## Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
That is so gentlemanly of you.

## Really?
There's only four of them...

## Your men knew the risks.
How much did they get from the safe?

## Parker.
What is going on here, man?

## What, sir?
That.

## Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?
Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least.

## You wouldn't have done that?
Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.

## So you can't tell me anything?
It's going to be a long winter.

## Can't you tell me anything?
It's going to be a long spring.

## Can you put men at all four?
No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.

## What is that?
Why, their intense hatred of you, of course.

## What the hell is that sound?
Vengeance.

## Listen, what are you doing tonight?
What? Oh, I'm...busy.

## Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?
Stop it. I'm...

## On a lot of lithium?
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.

## Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.

## Yes?
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.

## Courtney? Dinner?
I can't.

## Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish.

## Is that Donald Trump's car?
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.

## Are we here?
Yes.

## This is Dorsia?
Yes, dear.

## Is it a what?
It's a plain end. I think.

## It's a plain end, see? So?
Take it off.

## Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.
Why?

## See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?
Oh God, just get it over with.

## Will you call me before Thanksgiving?
Maybe.

## What are you doing tonight?
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.

## You and...Luis?
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...

## Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?
You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.

## Yes?
Nothing.

## Do you want to come to my apartment or not?
I'm not supposed to. But I can make an exception.

## You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it?
Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.

## So, you're looking great, how have you been?
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.

## Really?
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.

## Is your Evian spiked?
We should do it.

## Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
He's rich.

## No. I'm not. Why should I ?
Your hairline looks like it's receding.

## Why? What's wrong?
My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill my needs.

## Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.

## You're really serious, aren't you?
Yes, I am.

## But what about the past? Our past?
We never really shared one.

## Where are you going?
I'm just leaving.

## But where?
I have to return some videotapes.

## That's bone. And the lettering is something called Silian Rail.
What are the rules for a sweater vest?

## Eggshell with Romalian type. What do you think?
Nice.

## But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman?
I know her. I knew her.

## How did you guess?
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.

## Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was an interesting guy.

## Are you my two o'clock?
No.

## Can I help you?
I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.

## Doesn't he live here?
No, he doesn't.

## No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
There was no ad in the Times.

## Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?
Yes, naturally.

## What exactly do you mean?
The message you left.

## But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
Carnes? Wait.

## Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let alone...what was it you said he did to her?
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...

## It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
It's just not.

## Why not, you stupid bastard?
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.

## No, you...didn't?
Now, if you'll excuse me.

## Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a reservation there?
Lucky, I guess.

## That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
Uh huh.

## Patrick? Is that you?
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.

## Where are you going?
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.

## Patrick?
What? CARRUTHERS I'll call you.

## It looks that way, doesn't it?
That's Paul Owen.

## Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?
Maybe it's just the light.

## I guess you're right... THAT IS, IF THE FAGGOT IN THE NEXT STALL THINKS IT'S OKAY!
What?

## New card. What do you think?
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.

## Leaving what?
This.

## Don't tell me...merchant banking?
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.

## I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. Working for UNICEF now?
Dorsia.

## Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?
Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam.

## Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at nine o'clock?
We are totally booked.

## Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.

## I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.

## When?
After six.

## Oh? And what should I say?
Just...say...no.

## Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right?
Yes, sir.

## Oh, something. . romantic?
No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.

## No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?
You look nice today.

## Yes?
Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.

## You don't like this, I take it?
Come on, you're prettier than that.

## Ye-es, Je-an?
Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.

## Detective Donald KIMBALL?
Tell him I'm at lunch.

## Patrick?
Can you bring Mr...

## Yes, Patrick?
Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.

## Would you like to accompany me to dinner?
That is...if you're not doing anything.

## Anywhere you want?
Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.

## Jean? Sorbet?
Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.

## Want a bite?
I'm on a diet. But thank you.

## Do you have a boyfriend?
No, not really.

## Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
Growing. I'm glad you said that.

## Who's Ted Bundy?
Forget it.

## What's that?
Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun.

## Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?
What...No! Put it in the carton.

## Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?
I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.

## If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you. You don't want to get hurt, do you?
No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised. You're right, I should go.

## Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
Jean? Hello? Jean?

## Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
Patrick? I can't hear you.

## Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.

## A model? An actor?
No. Flattering, but no.

## Welt...it depends, why?
Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like it.

## What?
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.

## Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?
Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.

## Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank you, uh... Victoria?
Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.

## Next Saturday?
Yeah.

## Uh huh?
She's from...France.

## You're at Paul Owen s.
Why would I?

## Who?
Paul Owen.

## Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?
No.

## Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
Let's not get lewd. I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.

## No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.

## No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment. Was that anything important?
Oh that? Just mulling over business problems. Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors... Spreading gossip.

## So, what's the topic of discussion?
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.

## You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
No. I'm okay.

## Perrier? San Pellegrino?
The disappearance of Paul Owen.

## Understandable. Lime?
No, really. I'm okay.

## Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files, okay?
Shoot.

## How old are you?
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.

## Where did you go to school?
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.

## Your address?
Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building.

## Who do you ask?
You seem...nervous.

## Would you rather I not smoke?
No, I guess it's okay.

## You sure?
No problem.

## What can you tell me about Paul Owen?
Well...

## How well did you know him?
I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.

## Yale thing?
Yeah...Yale thing.

## So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.

## Do you feel that way?
No. Not really.

## Hang...out?
Yeah. You know...hang out.

## He had a yacht?
No, he just hung out there.

## Don't you know this?
I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help.

## Anything else you can tell me about Owen?
We were both seven in 1969.

## Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.

## Well, maybe he did, huh?
His girlfriend doesn't think so.

## But...has anyone seen him in London?
Actually, yes.

## Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing.
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?

## Have you consulted a psychic?
No.

## Had his apartment been burglarized?
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.

## I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.

## That's so typical, isn't it?
It's just strange. One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...

## Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late?
Uh, no. There's one...down here.

## So...you hang out here a lot?
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.

## Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?
I mean they want to get caught.

## Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame. Is he a suspect?
Not really.

## Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul's disappearance? Which was on the twentieth of December?
God...I guess...I was probably returning videotapes.

## What?
That's not the information I've received.

## Well, I could he wrong.
Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?

## Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.

## Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
Great, yes, I'd like that.

## Not a big music fan, eh?
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.

## No hash browns?
Not in the mood, I guess.

## But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.

## I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.

## But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.

## And?
I've questioned him.

## Marcus?
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.

## But Marcus denied it?
Yes.

## Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
Yes.

## He does? You're sure?
I checked it out. It's clean.

## Where was Marcus?
He wasn't with Paul Owen.

## So who was he with?
He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble, Harry Newman, George Butner and  - you.

## It's cold out, too, isn't it?
I'm so hungry.

## Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?
I lost my job...

## Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on the job?
Gee, uh, that's too bad.

## Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?
I'm not...

## I'm hungry.
You're not what? Qualified for anything else?

## Listen, what's your name?
Al.

## How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?
It's...it's...all right.

## Really? That's interesting. Not great?
Oh well, you know.

## So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?
I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you.

## Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?

## Another Martini, Paul?
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.

## Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
No, man. I'm gonna bail.

## Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
No, Owen.

## Is that a raincoat?
Yes, it is.

## You think so?
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.

## How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?
What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have reservations somewhere.

## Is it over?
They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.

## \"Make\" him?
You know what I mean.

## You don't wanna move, do you?
I can paint anywhere.

## But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?
I think that's great, Milo. I do.

## Didn't you visit the campus?
You saved my life in alot of ways.

## We're not gonna let it.
When's Brian coming for the TV?

## To our new life. ...What's wrong?
That's what I need to ask you. You know you can't keep anything from me.

## What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
That's what I'm asking myself. Does he have some genius stowed away? Why not let him write Skywire. 'Not saying it makes sense.

## Isn't that -- extreme?
What's extreme is what that ER doctor said when he pumped your stomach. Eat another sesame seed and that's it.

## What're you -- what?
It was a hate crime.

## They hack into people's programs?
It isn't a broadcast studio. It's -- a surveillance post or something. That's why they have the dishes on top.

## You can't just walk in, either.
You think I don't know that?

## Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever really noticed?
I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me.

## It's almost nine, I've been so worried! What did you see in there?
Nothing.

## Nothing?
It's what they said it is. An unfinished broadcast studio. You were right... I just drove to Seattle and back.

## I remember.
...Why?

## Guilt?
If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.

## ...Different?
Where were you? You know you can't keep anything from me.

## What?
I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again.

## ...What?
I know you. You're gonna run back to work right after dinner. I want my kiss now.

## Don't we have any chopsticks?
Oh, right. Hold on.

## Didn't mention he was going to the Justice Department?
No.

## Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing your hold on him, are you?
He'll tell me when he gets home.

## That'll be a test, won't it?
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.

## He wasn't acting?
I don't think he knows how.

## Right... What's that mean again?
It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...

## ...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
Yes sir. I need to talk to you.

## Milo?
Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.

## Milo?
My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley.

## It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.

## And Outpost? You're happy there?
Yes sir.

## You're living here?
Sure, I'll see what I can do.

## Well I parked illegally. See y'later?
Forgot to introduce you. I have a girlfriend.

## Will I get to work for Outpost?
No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost.

## What'd they ever do for you?
You're interfaced with our dish.

## ...When did you know?
You should've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects.

## That's gotta kill him, right?
Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.

## Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy?
Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world.

## Couldn't convince Teddy to come?
He's pretty tight with his family.

## Who's that?
I think they call him the \"Houseman.\" 'Cause \"guard\" sounds too weird.

## ...Hello?
Oh. No thanks.

## Okay. I'm Gary.
It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?

## ...Do I?
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.

## How's it going?
Maybe I'm going too fast.

## You did this -- overnight?
You're making me young again.

## Milo. What's up?
Well -- you sent for me.

## You really wrote this just today?
I'm sure.

## It scales, don't you think?
Definitely.

## Had you talked to him much lately?
Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.

## Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me, it's in the wrong place.
Did you?

## The wrong place?
Sure.

## What would you tell the kids? At your new school? You had to come up with a good story, right?
No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse.

## ...Worse?
Don't be so hard on yourself. With a brain like yours, you could connive with the best of 'em I bet.

## This is good. Who did it?
Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.

## What'd the girl say?
Let's go.

## What?
Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to 12.

## Gary?
Just do it.

## You do?
I mean, it's your life.

## ...You wanna work -- here?
Got out of my other commitment.

## You guys'll be using Teddy's old space, is that okay?
Cool.

## Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?
Every entry was authorized.

## What're we looking for?
Any irregularity in the pattern.

## Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do. What would Milo want in here, anyway?
They know. 'Just they don't trust me with it. So we'll get the evidence, first, ask questions later.

## You calling Phil and Randy?
I'm calling Gary.

## I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
Where we going?

## ...Were you?
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.

## Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
...Something like that. Yeah.

## What've you got there?
No. Please.

## \"There is no second place.\" Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration. Is it like that with your counselor?
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.

## Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.

## Why's that?
Long story. Not that interesting.

## So, when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers. Was that then? Or now?
Then and now. But not right now.

## But why would they --?
I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you. I know what he did to you.

## Oh yeah?
Is that my -- scenario? Tell me.

## Hmm?
I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean.

## What about the FBI?
They've got this guy in the DOJ, maybe others. We tell the wrong person, it's over.

## Who can we trust?
There's always a logical answer -- you just have to define the question.

## Do we post it on the Net?
He's got 12 satellites up. He's got dishes on top of 21. He's building this -- mega-network for Skywire. Let's use it.

## But they'd still get the idea, right?
It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.

## And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished.
You mean -- break in?

## Why were you snooping in my office?
Oh. I liked you. I was checking you out.

## Cause their apartments might be bugged?
I told Teddy about you.

## He doesn't know about the Day Care.
What'd he say?

## Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?
Same with the excerpts I'm choosing, they'll play against any of the images you described.

## That's lame, isn't it?
You'll come up with something.

## Does he know you know?
Why?!

## What?
He's been altering the coordinates since we logged on. He's a step ahead. Let's jump to 12.

## ...You got my E-mail?
And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime.

## Is that how Larry feels?
Uh. Not exactly.

## I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet? Milo?
I met this girl.

## What? Come on. Is it serious?
I don't know.

## What d'you mean?
I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.

## What does that mean?
Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one.

## So -- how far are we from the campus?
Oh we're not going to the campus.

## So how'd you like the house?
His Snapples were in alphabetical order.

## She's a programmer?
Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps. You'll be working with her.

## I've got a girlfriend, remember?
Right. That's rare around here. You know how nuns' re-married to Jesus? 'Posties are married to Outpost.

## What're they building?
Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites.

## Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
There is no public offering. The guy who wrote it joined some freakazoid cult in San Luis Obispo. 'Wrote this just to run their web site.

## Did you download Corey? In San Jose?
Damn. 'Have to go back over there. Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door.

## What is it?
Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.

## Where is he?
We're too late. Take a look.

## We're all grateful for that. Really. Go out the way you came in?
You seem surprised to see me.

## Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta... Please?
You may.

## Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?
I didn't, baby, you just told me.

## May I wash you?
Groovy.

## How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?
Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.

## Is it about my teeth?
Yes.

## Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem.

## Hey, how are you?
Hungry.

## Yes?
You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.

## WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.

## Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.

## Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.

## You mean Mrs. Kensington?
No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long- since retired. Ms. Kensington is her daughter.

## Yes?
Be careful.

## Yes?
Be careful.

## Where is Vanessa, by the way?
She's working on another lead right now.

## Yes?
Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.

## Yes?
Be careful.

## What's the other thing you're scared of?
Carnies.

## What?
Circus folk. Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.

## I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.
My God, Austin, what have you done?

## Yes, Basil?
Well, you can't always get what you want.

## Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
That does not compute.

## What's wrong with your hand?
Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak! Look at it, it's been rendered useless.

## Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?
I've got you, Dr. Evil!

## If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me. God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
My mother's doing quite well, thank you very much.

## I beg your pardon?
I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.

## Excuse me?
My wedding tackle.

## I'm sorry?
My meat and two veg.

## A Chigro?
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro... Chigro.

## Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.

## Why? What's wrong with my teeth?
Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me! Honestly, this isn't mine.

## Do you want to talk to him?
Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.

## Why?
We've got a doctor's appointment-- an evil doctor's appointment.

## How do you know?
I never forget a pussy... cat.

## Fancy a nibble?
I couldn't have another bite.

## Why?
I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.

## Austin, may I have a word with you?
Of course, luv.

## I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.

## No, did you use a condom?
Only sailors use condoms, man.

## Who?
You know who.

## Does that make you horny?
Not now, Austin.

## First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts?
Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case.

## What do we do now?
Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.

## Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?
Commander, this is Slater in SoWest Com Three. We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle.

## What are you saying, son?
It appears to be in the shape of Bob's Big Boy, sir.

## What's its current position?
Yes.

## Release the sharks! All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
My son?

## Dr. Evil?
Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.

## Really? Are they ill-tempered?
Please allow me to demonstrate.

## That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr.... Ehville?
Not me.

## An evil vet?
No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.

## An evil petting zoo?
You always do that! Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.

## Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.

## Yeah. What?
Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.

## Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
In due time.

## But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.

## Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you coming?
I don't want to.

## Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
Blow me.

## What did you say?
Show me.

## Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?
Great.

## How's Austin?
He's asleep.

## Why?
Because you managed to resist Austin Power's charms.

## What about his teeth?
You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.

## Did you ever want to?
You didn't answer my question, Mum.

## So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?
Well, it's kind of weird.

## And how do you feel about that?
I don't wanna take over the family business.

## What do you want to do, Scott?
I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.

## Seriously?
Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.

## You don't say. How real does it feel?
As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.

## There are limits?
The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.

## How long have I been here?
Three days.

## I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it?
Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.

## Sir August...? What now?
May I help you, madam ...

## You are female?
As you see.

## People, too.
Really -- what happened in 1922?

## Then who wins?
How curious ...

## Ropes?
He tried to warn us ...

## Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?
Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.

## The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...
What are you trying to do to me?

## To you ... ?
The Institute ... the funding ...

## Who?
Quite frankly ... it could have been you.

## This is an official matter, Mrs. Peel. No need to take it personally. Where are you going?
To find out who killed my husband.

## Next assignment?
Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ...

## But -- why?
You disappoint me, Emma. Can't you guess? For you. It was all for you ...

## Ring?
Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air.

## Then what's stopping you?
Speaking of Peter, there's more good news, You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.

## Choices?
I'll never marry you.

## Doctor Peel, I presume?
Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.

## I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?
Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.

## And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
I didn't. Mother did.

## Mother?
... Showers followed by sunny periods.

## A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating?
You can but I wish you wouldn't ...

## You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk?
Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you.

## But why? What's the point?
A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.

## Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
As per mother's instructions.

## Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking. How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.

## After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?
No thanks.

## An eccentric recluse?
Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He has a wife called June. And a daughter somewhere -- Julie.

## June, July ... August?
The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.

## So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?
Small talk. Try the weather.

## You should be dead. How do you feel?
Strange.

## Why should they think that?
You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead.

## Did he say who?
No. But he must know. Incidentally, my double left you with this.

## An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?
Did you say formal? I must dress.

## Either way ... may I ask, why you dress in that fashion?
I should have thought that was obvious ... I'm in mourning.

## How on earth can you tell?
Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...

## Any ideas?
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...

## Is that written in his shoe?
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...

## Not quite. This is my field.
Thanks ... I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?

## Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
But if someone miniaturized the process...

## Is that what you think?
Oh, well ... Just my type, Mrs. Peel.

## Do you always drive this fast?
Have I trespassed on a male prerogative? We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ...

## What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?
Barely.

## You will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection, won't you?
The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ...

## Was I?
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...

## To kill me?
Nothing personal.

## Yes ... ?
... when I don't. It comes down to one thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust.

## And do you trust me?
I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...

## Is that all?
But you did suspect me.

## Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
I thought you played by the rules.

## You don't trust me?
As far as you trust me.

## Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?
No idea who. No idea why ...

## Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody.

## Why's he called 'Invisible'?
You'll find out.

## Aren't you coming?
There's a reception this evening. Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend.

## What's that you're wearing?
It's called Black Leather.

## What is it?
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.

## Trubshaw again? What now?
Snuff. I must insist you try some.

## Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?
Have a look at this.

## Where are you going?
The plot. Hello, we must be going ...

## Have you any place in mind?
As a matter of fact I have ...

## Our little paradise -- just made for two?
Not quite.

## Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?
Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...

## I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect.

## Where's Mother?
Mobile HQ. In a blue funk. Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ...

## You don't believe him?
It's Mother you have to convince. He's very agitated. Wait here.

## Decontamination -- ?
And you've a new wardrobe. He does want you to look attractive. He tells me you're very beautiful.

## Or rather, you don't. Learnt the tricks in camouflage. Till this accident made a prang of things. How can I help you, Mrs. Peel?
Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch, Valentine Peel.

## Surveillance? By whom?
Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.

## Well, I can't possibly go like this.
Getting to what?

## ... and now?
Privately owned by ...

## I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed?
A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...

## Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush English village transformed overnight into African scrubland? Blizzards in summer?
She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.

## Amnesia?
Possibly. Split personality ...

## Insane ... ?
Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.

## Why?
She may try to kill you.

## Anyone particular in mind?
You.

## This man -- did you see him?
No. Her husband, she says. Alice tried to warn us. A trap. Tell Mother beware. Tell Father That's all.

## You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband?
Mother and Father know best.

## Where?
In your operation.

## Are you alright, young man?
I think so, thank you so much ...

## I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
She was ...

## You with Mother or Father?
Both, actually.

## Mrs. Peel -- ?
Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...

## But did they teach you this?
Bang-bang ... you're dead.

## Aren't you forgetting about something?
Ugh ...

## What's happening?
Debbie's marrying Rick.

## Does Cole know about this?
Really -- you went with him for two years.

## Bobbie, what are you talking about?
O'Neill just tole me. It's sooo great... I don't believe it.

## What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?
They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.

## What do you mean?
I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.

## I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?
Rick's got an important announcement to make.

## What?
We're going for a little liquid refreshment.

## Great. I'll go with you. Wait a second. Hey, Raul! Move that car, will you?
Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.

## When do the girls get to the party?
Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.

## Cole. Don't you know it's bad luck to see the groom before the wedding?
I want Debbie.

## What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
Five thousand dollars.

## What is this person's story here?
Thanks, Dad. Cole, go away.

## The car for Debbie?
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.

## Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?
Low mileage... Handles like a dream.

## Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
You've had it. I'm gonna get you.

## Fan out and look for them.
Cole, what the hell are you doing?

## Hello?
Mr. Thomerson.

## Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
Yes I did.

## Fine. How's everything going?
Not so good. He wouldn't listen to reason. He stole my car... my Porsche... I can't find it anywhere...

## Hi, everybody. Am I late?
Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.

## So, Cole, you been practicing your game?
Sure have...

## But how can I do that?
If it were me, I'd reason with him first. Then, if that failed... ...I'd take more persuasive action.

## So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game. Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?
What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.

## Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing here? What happened?
The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down...

## Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
1002.

## Cole?
Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.

## Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
No, Cole, I...

## You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
I'm not. I just thought I should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else.

## What are we having?
It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.

## Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event. Well, what do you think?
It looks awful.

## Are you going to have women at your party?
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.

## Oh, those. Why do you ask?
Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.

## What's the matter?
I don't know... I just feel scared.

## About what?
I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.

## Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
C'mere.

## Can't I just go with you guys?
Sorry, we got men's business to do. It's no place for a lady.

## Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
Let's get naked.

## Are you okay?
Yeah.

## This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
You're so romantic...

## Are you sure this is a good idea?
Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.

## Why is Cole here?
You know your father enjoys his company.

## Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying?
A real turd.

## What are you talking about, asshole?
Your whores never showed up.

## Why?
Because I'm pissed off. Now give me your cash.

## Because I love her. What can I tell you?
Let's have a toast.

## What's going on?
It's true.

## Hookers beat you up?
Yes.

## Gary, how we doing, big stallion?
Rick, I really think I'm in love.

## You're a pimp?
I'm telling you I am, Joe.

## So, Larry, how have you been?
Just in love with everybody. It's really a beautiful planet. I love you, Rick. I love you guys. I love everybody.

## Larry, you and your wife got problems?
I don't want to talk about it. I love you guys. I love my friends.

## Is that all the coke in the place?
That's it.

## You want to share it?
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.

## What do you mean, it changes?
Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.

## You okay?
Yeah, I guess so.

## Really?
Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.

## What the hell are you doing?
I'm trying to slash my wrists.

## You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
I couldn't find any razor blades.

## This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You don't have to kill it.

## Can't I just maim it a little?
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.

## Girls, why don't we go inside for lunch. Boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?
In a second... And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.

## How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?
Klupner. Mrs. Klupner.

## Mrs.?
I'm separated.

## I'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. Could you undo a few buttons?
Of course.

## Where'd she go?
She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.

## Where the hell is he?
Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.

## We'll spend an hour with \"Nymphos Without Pants\"...
What's the matter?

## Olivier's in that, right?
Then it's on to the real thing.

## Don't you love it when old friends stop by?
Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.

## What the hell is that?
My gift to you.

## I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now?
I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure.

## About what?
Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.

## Who was that?
I don't know.

## What's this?
Got me.

## How 'bout this?
Still drawing a blank.

## He look familiar?
Very.

## Who's your friend?
How about this, a Trojan donkey.

## What are you going to do about it?
What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.

## Who?
Debbie.

## What's with her costume?
I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.

## Stan, you're depressing me... Hey, I didn't know you were going to fill 'er up. Just take a couple of gallons, okay?
That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.

## Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of help.

## Great. I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
FRANCIS You're late again, Rick.

## How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
I don't know.

## Can you believe how perfect it fits?
Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.

## Wash it to the windows?
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.

## You know Knowlton pretty well?
Yeah...

## Kind of an asshole, wasn't he?
There's a fire. We've got a job here. Let's get on with it.

## It doesn't go like that.
Did you do it for Tim?

## Who asked you?
If you do it like that it'll open in the fire. Then you'll get burned and DIE.

## Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it?
I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.

## So you're going to fight fires now, huh?
Doesn't work on you. See ya around, little brother.

## Been ripping off fire stations?
It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub.

## What, you've never seen one before?
In the Field Museum once.

## People actually used to pay you for this?
Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.

## Why'd you come here, Brian?
Big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie -- that I don't think is going to make it.

## Ya love it, probie?
I'm in heaven, Lt.

## Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know?
Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too.

## This?
Yeah... too bright...

## What, are you kidding? By myself?
What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.

## You got a problem with drilling, probie?
No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.

## Ready?
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...

## You okay?
I waited... I would have fucking waited...

## You said you wanted to know something, Brian. What did you learn today? What do you say, Brian, huh? Time to move on?
...Not now, Brian.

## Fuck you.
I had that fire. He didn't listen!

## Hey, what are you doing here?
Just... Just wanted to say hello...

## You're selling dad's boat?
Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...

## Saw what?
When dad died, I saw another fire...

## Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
I don't know, Brian... I don't know...

## How do you know?
I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.

## -- What were they doing there?
They were for the fucking boat, Brian.

## What are we going to do about this?
I'll handle it.

## Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
You're his Lt., Stephen... Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?

## Yeah? What have you been up to?
I work for city hall.

## With grenadine, right?
When I was twenty.

## Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.

## -- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.
Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?

## Bullshit. Marty's plan is only about efficiency. I've got two cousins on the job, you think I'd work for him if I didn't believe in it?
What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard.

## So now you suddenly care about my future?
I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it.

## How's it going?
Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.

## Hey... So are you dating your boss or what?
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed. Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...

## You think that's really any of your business?
Well, you did invite me here.

## Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.

## Got anything to drink in there?
Oh, there might be something stashed away for emergencies.

## This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think?
Homey.

## Then why did you quit?
I wanted to be a good one.

## Brian. What's wrong?
You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.

## You could check. It'd be in his files.
Yeah? And just how much of all this has been \"doing your job\"?

## Do you know what you're asking me to do?
Yes.

## What'll you do?
I don't have the slightest idea...

## I'll see ya around, huh?
It's a small town.

## Hey, do I know you?
I'm close... but I can't get who it is...

## Sure you do.
Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?

## Trychticholorate.
Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?

## Who the fuck is doing this?
After it took your dad... the fire... did it look at you Brian? Did it talk to you?...

## Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?
If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.

## You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
I want another shot, Sir.

## Your Dennis' kid. I work alone.
If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --

## Are you still here?
Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.

## Where are you going?
Pest control.

## Glass?
Do we have a language barrier here? Glass.

## What?
But he killed these guys.

## That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?
No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.

## Are you going public with this?
No. Do that and I guarantee you'll scare him off. I don't want him running away.

## In a word, Brian, what is this job all about?
Fire.

## It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?
Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now...

## Did you pull me out?
Yeah.

## Did I say thanks?
No.

## So what do you want me to do?
Your brother was a good man.

## Brian?
Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.

## Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?
Four months.

## Four months?
I know, I know, Should'a called. I've been really busy. I joined the fire department.

## Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?
Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident.

## Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?
Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.

## Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?
Completely out of control.

## Engine 115, right?
How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.

## Ah man, if you're gonna bribe your way into a station, why not 17 with me and your brother?
Man. Something sure put a crimp in his evening.

## So, you surviving without me?
There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.

## Uh huh. And \"Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins\". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?
Management were pin heads.

## \"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards\"?
Coffee sucked.

## Who's going to die?
We gotta roll, Stevie...

## Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
You can't talk about my brother like that...

## Stephen, what are you doing here?
Fixing my roof.

## Where's Sean?
He's got piano lessons.

## Oh yeah? How's he doing?
He's going to be a fireman.

## He treats you okay?
Okay.

## You want some coffee?
Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.

## What's wrong, Stephen? C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind. How's Brian doing?
He's out.

## I know he's out, but how's he doing?
Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.

## Yeah? When was the last time?
You can't keep being his father...

## What's wrong?
Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.

## Putty? On both doors?
There's something else kinda interesting...

## What the hell was it doing in the fire?
That's your job.

## How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?
Didn't think you'd make it.

## Who's this?
He works for me.

## Did he tell you how we finally met?
Nobody cares, Ronald.

## And old ladies?
-- Burn them.

## Got a cause?
Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke.

## What do you listen to, Stephen?
You don't know... nobody knows...

## Don't you have any leads at all?
No Marty, I don't.

## Is there a connection between them, Alderman?
Just catch the son of a bitch.

## Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?
Investigator...

## What's to believe?
That Jesus Christ was the Son of God and he came to die for your sins.

## You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
Yeah.

## Why?
Christ! Shit! I could kill them all with my bare hands.

## Who?
Those fucking Mob assholes.

## C'mere. You got some good blow, right?
Yeah.

## Who?
I'm a Catholic.

## WOMAN Are you all right, honey?
I was gonna bring it back myself.

## So what are you doing here?
WOMAN He wants to know who brought in the chalice.

## What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you?
The rich kind. Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.

## How are you doing, man?
Very good. Very good. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.

## There. Now you've got your profit and more. You'll have more product day after tomorrow, right?
Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.

## Me?
I forgive you.

## Large?
All right, cop. I want my money.

## What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.

## Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop!
Yeah, sucker. You better be there!

## All right. What are you gonna do?
I want 15 on the Mets.

## How about 7 1/2?
Hey, man. Don't give me that bullshit. Don't pussy-out on me. The Mets are a fucking lock. I wanna make some money.

## Are you sure?
Yeah. I'm sure.

## OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.

## That's my problem. Just put in my bet.
Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?

## What money?
I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic.

## The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.

## You knew them? Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew?
Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for this joint.

## Ho!
...that simpleton is holding back the race. They got rid of us and keep those two buffoons, Mantan and Sleep 'N Eat, y'knowwhatI'msayin'?

## I'm gonna start a chant and I want y'all to follow me. Let's make our own 2 real coons know you're ready to start the show.
My name is Honeycutt and I want to try something different. Can you do this for me?

## Well you did.
C'mon. It's easy. It's the same thing y'all do out at the Yankee game, no different 'cept we changing one word. Everybody go it?

## Give me some?
I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street. You must be crazy, Julius.

## Who are you revolting against?
Please.

## If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours. What's his name again?
Delacroix.

## What's your name?
My righteous name is BIG BLACK.

## And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today?
We gonna drop some knowledge, wisdom and understanding. The Mau- Mau's, we be scientists. We drop science.

## What do you do?
I'm a revolutionary.

## Why are you smiling so?
I'm not smiling.

## Certified ladies' man, huh?
She's also moorish.

## What's that?
Moorish. Ya get a little taste of dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.

## What's wrong with him?
Must be the pressure.

## Why they gotta make my nose so big?
Look at my lips.

## What are you talkin' about?
Jim Jones, y'know. I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.

## Meaning?
I'm out.

## So that's what you been doing?
Damn skippy.

## Y'know what I mean. Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?
Sloan and I have been looking all over for you.

## You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
No offense.

## How much?
First things first. I have to know if Manray is up for this.

## What kind of show is this gonna be?
Different.

## What about in the mean time? Not the in between time?
You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.

## Did we get our bill yet?
Ahh, the luxuries of life.

## Are you crazy? The joint is crawling with cops now. You wanna go to Rikers? Go to the hoosegow?
We got evicted from our home. We've both been on the streets for the last week.

## If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
Some tap dancing, some singing.

## How different?
Trust me. Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other.

## To what?
You're now Mantan.

## Why?
You have to start getting into your character.

## I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
Mantan?

## How you sound?
I won't do it anymore.

## Yes. And I say yes because who is to judge? Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not? Who? Who can play God?
But the line has to be drawn.

## Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust?
Can I finish? Thank you. I had a great Aunt, we called her Sister. She went to her grave not believing man had walked on the Moon.

## Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...

## So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
I wasn't told about this until Marie informed me as soon as I got off the elevator.

## Do you know what C.P. Time is?
I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting.

## So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.
Word!!!

## The name of the show?
It is called, MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.

## Don't worry about that, that's my department. Now who do we cast? We need a star. Can Whoopi sing or dance?
I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.

## Are these our two stars, sitting here in front of my nose? Which one is Mantan again?
That's a great handle.

## What are there character traits?
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.

## And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
Yep, you guessed it.

## Who are the other characters?
Do we have characters? How about Honeycutt, Snowflake, Rastus, Nigger, Jim, Sambo, Jungle Bunny, and how could we forget Aunt Jemima.

## I don't know about that plantation angle.
We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis' one. What's the setting?

## We think so.
What are you talkin' 'bout? It's the move. Stay wid me now. We're movin' fast. What does everybody else think about this?

## Sleep 'n Eat, what do you do?
I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.

## You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
I just want you to meet him. Keep an open mind.

## What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
If Spielburg can direct \"The Color Purple\" and \"Amistad\", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot.

## That's exactly my point. Has he even directed actors before in anything?
No!!! Just meet the guy. That's all I'm asking. Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director. You can have that.

## What do you want?
I want to speak with you.

## How did I end up at the third rate chittlin' circuit greasy hole in the wall in West Hell, Virginny? Is that what you're asking ya Daddy?
That's what I'm askin'.

## Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
All I know is what happened to me. All that other mess I just file into the \"life's too short\" category.

## Enough about me, what's happening with you?
The same old, same old. Trying to get my stuff through.

## Dem white boys giving you a hard time?
Nuthin' I can't handle.

## Where do you go from here?
Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.

## How long has my father been like this?
Not that often. He was excited to see you.

## So he drank himself into a stuper?
The drinking is for the pain. It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.

## So what's up with you?
Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.

## Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
Nobody told me anything.

## What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
It hit me like a ton of bricks.

## The idea was out there in the universe. Now what?
Manray was under our nose the whole time.

## Do you know how you will use him?
Not yet, but this thing will never get made.

## What point is that?
The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.

## You getting cold feet?
I'm in till the end.

## Can't you just quit? Walk away?
And lose out on my money? The only way I get paid is if I get fired. And that's what I intend to do.

## You okay?
I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.

## What is your problem?
My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.

## What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
I wouldn't bet against it. My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.

## Which one is your brother?
The big one.

## What do you want me to say?
Just don't lie to me.

## Who's side are you on?
I'm sorry, I can't help it. It's too funny.

## So you have your small victory, now what?
A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.

## What is this?
A gift.

## For what?
No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it.

## Is that good or bad?
It's all good. You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank. Plus, I love these old black collectibles.

## How so?
To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.

## Why'd you do that?
I don't want to hear it.

## How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.

## Oh, is he? You getting jiggy with Mantan?
Please don't go there.

## Do you have to be so damn forthright?
DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.

## Light?
That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light. This bucket of blood.

## Work related or otherwise?
Otherwise. I trust you know the difference. You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU.

## Yes, your name?
He, I'm Mona.

## Oh, is that what I'm doing?
David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas? Everybody just talk out loud.

## That's the way it came out. Let me ask you one question. Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?
The point I'm trying to make is that this is a blessing. It's going to be fun doing this show and we should all look at it that way.

## Can I kiss you too?
Naw. I'll take the zero.

## You feel good, not nervous?
I feel fine.

## Not nervous? Relaxed?
Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready.

## What are you? A man or a mouse? Are you a punk? Punking out on me?
No.

## You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.

## You've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost. Don't you know you should never let them see you sweat. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
Yeah.

## How's the food?
Can't beat it with a hammer. Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.

## That's wonderful. Isn't that what you always wanted, a show of your own?
It was. It is. But this is a different kind of show.

## To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.

## He said that?
Yes he did.

## Where is he?
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.

## You going to attack me too. The show is a hit. Aren't you happy for me?
Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.

## Yes I have, very hard. Has Daddy called?
No.

## Not at all?
You know how your Daddy is.

## I won't forget. When are you coming up here to see your mother?
Soon.

## Nice to meet you. If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?
I just turned twenty.

## Where are you from?
Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.

## Yes, I know. Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before? Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES. I'M A NEGRO.

## My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
This is a TV show, not a music video.

## Then will you teach me what I need to know. Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
This is a travesty. A debacle.

## You've never had any formal training, either?
Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.

## You sing and dance?
A little. I just graduated from NYU film school. Cinema studies.

## What do you mean?
Are you and him kicking it? Knocking boots. Y'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout.

## Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.

## No mo' \"city slickers.\" Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
EAT The one with da big...

## EAT Too bad. How 'bout a dress?
Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...

## EAT So when are you comin' to pick us up?
Around...

## EAT You slept too near where you got in?
I slept too near where I fell out.

## Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you? Using all dose ten dollar words?
Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.

## EAT Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?
Dat's yo Uncle Ben. That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.

## EAT How be dat?
I don't know who I am.

## A lot?
Enough.

## What do you want to know?
The good stuff.

## Are you trying to rap to me?
This is a nice place. It must have cost a pretty penny.

## Oh you do, huh?
Just a little something' somethin'.

## You don't read, do you?
Never read a book in my whole life.

## Why don't you call him?
For what? He left. Not me.

## What?
You look beautiful like that.

## How did you get this gig?
Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.

## You leave something out?
After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.

## And what?
Stop playing me Sloan.

## Did you ever sleep with DeLa?
We did it one time, only once. It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid. Everything I've got I've earned.

## Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
Don't try to change to the subject.

## Why don't you answer?
I know I won't be your puppet.

## Where are you bound for?
That is none of your business.

## Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
Not at all, sir. I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.

## Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?
Don't bully, Mr. Best. Here are the pistols. God bless you, my boy; and when I count three, fire.

## Hoity-toity! John Best, what's the matter here?
I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways. I ain't used to 'em, sir.

## What is your uncle's name?
O'Grady.

## This is a very good inn. Shall we stop for dinner?
This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland. Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.

## Do you want to see the loveliest woman in Europe?
Ah! You sly rogue, I see that will influence you.

## Where's the beauty you promised me?
Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly.

## Good morning, Private James. Please come in. I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.
Neither!

## What are the Chevalier's intentions?
I am not sure. The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money, he would have to fight for it.

## Has he sent the challenge yet?
Not yet, but I believe he intends to.

## And his baggage?
This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.

## And so I am.
The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?

## Have you taken my message to him?
The meeting is arranged. Captain Best is waiting for you now.

## My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
Your cousins go out with him.

## Is Miss Dugan well?
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.

## Good heavens! Whatever? Has she died of grief?
She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband. She is now Mrs. John Best.

## Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.
Whom have I been harboring in my house? Who are you, sirrah?

## I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
I don't know.

## Where is my rascal, Lazlo?
I will let down the steps for your honor.

## Good gracious! What is this?
You are going to drive to the frontier.

## You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?
Yes, sir. Here is my letter.

## Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?
Yes, sir.

## For whom else have you worked?
No one, sir. Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.

## Who else can give me information about you?
Only the agency of servants.

## But how, sir?
Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital. I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.

## Certain?
Perfectly certain, because I shall make him tremble.

## Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.

## Have you had one?
Never.

## But, for a time... a passing fancy?
Not even that.

## How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?
Not one.

## Have you not a man whom you value?
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.

## What! You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more. I could value only someone whom I loved.

## How so?
By loving you, with no hope of possessing you.

## You want my heart?
It is my only object.

## And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?
Then I will respectfully take leave of her.

## You will do as you please. It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other. Do you not agree?
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.

## Poor man. And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
I ask only a payment on account today -- after that, you will find me undemanding, obedient and discreet.

## Will we always leave it at this?
Always, my dear one, never any further. Love is a child to be pacified with trifles. A full diet can only kill it.

## Why are you shaking?
With pleasure at finding the ribbon.

## Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
But you refused me, Dorothy.

## What, with me on the pillion? Would you kill poor me?
Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.

## I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend?
As much as possible.

## As much as possible?
Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.

## Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?
By name only.

## Yes!
Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?

## Does this assignment interest you?
Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein.

## Was he cheated?
In so far as I can tell these things -- no. I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.

## When is he to go?
Then this must be done tomorrow.

## Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong. Have you lost much?
That fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill, which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me.

## But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.

## May I be quite frank with you?
Yes, of course.

## Did you buy the horse, papa?
Now, just have a little patience, my boy. Your birthday isn't until next week.

## Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
Good night, papa.

## What the devil? What kind of fools do we have here? Pottle, who told the lad this story?
I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's farm to see him.

## Is he all right, papa?
Yes, he's fine.

## Would you have me spend my life all alone?
In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.

## I beg your pardon?
Come, come, sir. I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.

## I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?
Sir, let those laugh that win.

## Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
Yes. He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.

## And he doesn't care about me?
He is only curious to know who you are.

## Will he wish to know the details of this night?
Tender Hegenheim.

## Can I at least have a drink?
It's ten thirty in the morning.

## Hurricane kept you up, too?
Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going.

## I'm -- I'm sorry...
Who?

## A target, Kendall, cap a fucking target. What's wrong with you?
Maybe he'll be there. Either way, we have to go.

## Shut up, Mueller.
None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?

## We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion -- Where's Pike?
We found him like this...

## You too?
We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.

## Why not?
I asked for a policeman.

## You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
It's... too slow.

## What do you like then?
I don't know... I like the Army.

## You did Basic here?
There's no need...

## Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay?
Okay.

## Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
I'm not telling you what happened.

## Okay... but I would like to know about the other cadets. What they were like -- nice guys?
Some.

## And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?
Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.

## You smoke, Ray?
This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.

## Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
We've found all of them.

## And the bodies?
You won't find them. Won't find West, either. He's too good.

## Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?
That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.

## He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?
Epilepsy.

## Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Yeah.

## Where's the cabin?
Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.

## Can't do that now, though, can you?
Ohhhh, I don't think so...

## How do you know that?
Your weapons, Sergeant.

## Why?
We were each given three so whoever killed West will be missing one.

## Jesus, what happened?
West... he's dead.

## So you killed him?
I...

## Right?
Yeah...

## Which anyone coulda taken out of my gear on the chopper. Were you watching your pack on the ride in?
Ray, this is my life here. I ain't gonna pretend I'm not happy West is gone, but you know I couldn't have done this. It's not in me.

## If not you, then who?
Mueller.

## Look in my pack.
Who you gonna trust, Ray? Him or your friend?

## Why?
Just look. Little pocket.

## Why... why didn't you tell me?
Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ain't exactly something you want to broadcast. Only Mueller and Childs know.

## Way I figure it, West must have found out about their little business and was gonna bust them, so they decided to get rid of him first...
You saw West, right? How was he killed?

## They?
Mueller and Childs. One of them must've taken the grenade from my pack on the chopper...

## You... I've seen you around the Base. But you... You're not Army, are you?
Coast Guard, special detective detail. We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk.

## But not the only victim, right?
My, my, my, how did things turn so hostile so quickly? If I didn't know better, I'd say you two were out to get me.

## Then who did?
Maybe I shouldn't tell you that. Maybe I should tell you I wasn't scared at all. But I was... Enough to almost kill him.

## Why did he come back for you?
I honestly don't know. Maybe to have someone to cover for him. And I wish I could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men.

## How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
Mr. Hardy?

## Can I go to jail for punching a guy who's been shot?
Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.

## Is it the truth?
Dunbar will testify that you were.

## Something funny, Levi?
Because of what I saw. Who really killed West.

## How do you know?
Because I was standing next to him.

## Maybe he...
Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him?

## This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, the closest thing we have to an in- house investigator.
How are you?

## And here you are going out of house. How's that make you feel, Jules?
It's not West, is it? Tell me it's not West.

## I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
Cadet Roberto R. Nunez. Killed right in front of me.

## Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me?
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.

## Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.
And I'm the closest thing to it, right?

## Who killed Pike?
Someone must have got a shot off. He wasn't exactly a moving target.

## Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?
Yeah.

## Does Osborne agree?
That's horseshit and you know it.

## They're taking your command, aren't they?
The Senator...

## What are you talking about?
You're drunk --

## You knew Sergeant West?
He was our Drill here. Man's older than sand.

## Subtlety really isn't one of you finer points, is it, Osborne?
Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall --

## He's in interrogation?
Yes.

## That is the most unprofessional --
Thank you. At some point in there I'm gonna rub my nose. When I do, go at him with everything you got.

## Good cop/bad cop?
Something like that.

## You made me look like an idiot --
Baseball?

## You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?
You're right. We should sit in silence.

## What is that?
Microrecorder for Kendall -- didn't have time to wire his room. Now tell me why you joined the army or I'll jab this pen through your neck.

## Something like that. You?
I lost a bet.

## This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?
The very same.

## You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?
I plan to grow on you.

## Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
He's telling the truth, up to a point.

## Something wrong?
Being back here. Gives me the willies.

## Not the happiest of memories?
Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.

## That was kid gloves?
Have no fear, Osborne, we have not yet begun to fight.

## Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?
I don't know.

## You said you owed Styles and now you're gonna turn your back on him?
You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --

## Why do you care?
I didn't shoot West...

## What?
At least you and Kendall agree on that.

## What happened next?
And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.

## That bugs you too?
Little bit.

## Are you sure?
Positive. Hardy, they planned this.

## Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second?
Good idea.

## You mean the falsely accused?
You wanted to break him.

## So what now?
Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.

## Think it'll work?
Nah.

## For what?
That's gonna stay my secret.

## Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries. I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?
No bodies, no West...

## What?
Seven guys. What was it you said? You were \"just starting to believe I wasn't the guy people said\".

## What if I don't want it?
Tough.

## West?
Nobody saw. But I don't think so.

## Do I have a choice in this?
Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.

## Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.

## Think it'll work?
Nah.

## Want company?
A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.

## The faggot speaks.
How?

## You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
We should tell him we're not going.

## He said what?
\"You're gonna die tonight, faggot\". Clear as day.

## No one else heard it?
He whispered it in my ear.

## But you didn't see it, right?
Like I said, I was in the kitchen. When I came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone.

## Running out of time, are we? Tick- tock, tick-tock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop?
Fifty minutes.

## What happened with Nunez?
He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had to kill him...

## Hurricane's due after midnight and we're still going out?
Toughens us up, Pike. You don't like it, quit.

## Sign here and here. Hey, ain't you the folks workin' on that whole hulabaloo from last night?
Yeah.

## So?
It's too neat.

## You want Kendall, don't you?
He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don't do that if you're not involved.

## What happens to Dunbar now?
Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. You'll understand if I don't walk you out.

## I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
Jesus, kid. Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?

## Who is she? Where does she live?
Kid. Don't waste your time. She's out of your league.

## Didn't kill anything, did I?
A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.

## Welcome to ya. What's your name?
Edward Bloom.

## Bloom like a flower?
Yes.

## You were expecting me?
Not yet.

## What is this place?
The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.

## The poet? What ever happened to him?
He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you.

## Why?
No one's ever left.

## Or are you too scared?
I'll go in right now and get that eye.

## You get the eye?
I brought it.

## Can I see him?
Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.

## How long have you known my father?
Thirty years. Maybe more.

## Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?
A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.

## Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
No.

## What did she look like?
Well, she... uh...

## Was she nekkid?
Yeah.

## How old are you?
Eighteen.

## How are you gonna make it without your shoes?
I suspect it will hurt a lot.

## How did you know?
No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.

## I'm sorry. Have I offended you?
You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different. You married.

## Hi. How are you feeling?
I was dreaming.

## What were you dreaming about?
That's terrible.

## Can I take your picture?
You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.

## Please?
That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else.

## Oh, so this is a tall tale?
Well, it's not a short one.

## Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?
Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.

## Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?
I can.

## What's your name, Giant?
Karl.

## You don't like it?
Okay.

## What did she say?
Beats me.

## You're not trying to run away?
Just to be sure, you can take my pack.

## What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?
Jesus Christ.

## Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.

## Am I?
Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...

## You think I'm up for it?
You learned from the best.

## So how does it happen?
Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to ruin it for you.

## What did he say?
You owe me three-fifty.

## When did you ever work in an office?
There's a lot you don't know about me.

## You know where the chemicals are?
I used to do it when you were gone, remember? I used to do it a lot.

## Why not religion, Dad?
It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're going to offend.

## Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.

## What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.

## What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be?
Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.

## The river?
Tell me how it happens.

## How what happens?
How I go.

## Where are we headed?
You say...

## Daffodils?
They're your favorite flower.

## How did you get so many?
I called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way I could get my wife to marry me.

## How can I convince you to stop?
Go out with me.

## Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
I can't imagine any place better than here.

## So what are you up to now?
I'm robbing this place.

## How did you know my father?
This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.

## Were you and my father having an affair?
Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.

## Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?
Because he's dying.

## Do you like it, being pregnant?
I do.

## Did you?
You never told me how your parents met.

## Mmm, what?
Mmm, what. I know better than to argue romance with a French woman.

## Do you love your father?
Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.

## Do you love him?
But it's not true.

## What happened?
Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.

## How did you get here?
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.

## Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
He's up with your father.

## How is he?
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.

## How much time does he have left?
You don't talk about those things. Not yet.

## Mom, would you say you understand Dad?
Of course.

## What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
Yes.

## Would you say you understand Josephine?
Yes. But that's a different...

## Was she one of your teachers?
No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.

## That really happened?
Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.

## Is he awake?
He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.

## Did you and Dad have any other property?
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.

## Mom, do you want some time with Dad?
Yes. Thank you.

## What for?
You know what for.

## There's over eighty thousand here.
Such as?

## What do you mean?
You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.

## Do you want to stop?
Yes.

## What's this?
It's nothing. I burnt myself.

## Do you like it?
Yeah.

## What?
You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.

## A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby?
Name it.

## What are you doing here?
What. You're what? You're with this creep now.

## You can see why it's sensitive?
Uh... Yes.

## Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.

## What are you doing here?
Sorry. You've lost me...

## What did he say?
He says he feels safe here.

## So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?
Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.

## What was that?
I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.

## So how long will you be in England?
Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.

## You're asking for my documents?
No, no...

## Binoculars. He had these Binoculars he has kept from the war.
What?

## What was that?
Oh nothing.

## Do you believe in love?
I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.

## How is bank?
Fine. I thought you were leaving today.

## What did he say? Tell me!
What? What does he want?

## What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?
He wants money.

## Is that everything?
Yes.

## I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
Yes.

## I bet. What about me? Am I how you imagined?
Yes.

## And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you?
Yes.

## Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?
Yes.

## Good. Or should I speak slower?
Yes.

## Do you follow or should I speak slower?
Yes.

## Uh... Are you a giraffe?
Yes.

## Sorry?
I don't understand.

## They go. John. They go.
Syevodnya?

## What's wrong?
They go.

## So what are you going to do?
They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.

## What?
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...

## No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?
You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.

## Shut up. Have you got your passport?
Yes.

## What?
I said I don't have any.

## But, you know, so what?
Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed.

## Excuse me?
He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.

## Why not?
Shut up. I'm not listening.

## So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
I don't hate you.

## And? What are you saying?
And. It's wrong.

## So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?
Sometimes.

## Sometimes which?
Sometimes neither.

## Some... What does that mean?
There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.

## Why?
Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.

## I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.

## What?
You...

## So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?
You don't understand me.

## I wasn't saying anything.
Excuse me?

## Then okay. So how old were you when you met him?
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.

## Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
No.

## Have you had any before?
No.

## Are you scared?
Not really. Maybe a little.

## What?
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.

## What?
I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.

## She's alive!! She is not dead?
Laugh it up.

## Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
I don't want anyone to die.

## What's your name?
You know you can come under the blanket.

## I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?
No. I think I better just go.

## Please. Why not?
Because it was a lie.

## Okay. Promise?
You can probably buy them on the flight.

## Why?
I'm not asking you to marry me.

## What does it mean?
Maybe you will find out.

## Is the flight full?
I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.

## How do you want to pay?
Cash.

## What are you doing?
Just wanted to see.

## You know the rules. You do know the rules, don't you?
Yeah, I know.

## Lazarus?
Oh! Gave me a start.

## You hurt it?
I'm standing most of my day. They're for support. Didn't see you in church this mornin'.

## Yes?
I need to uh...

## Is your niece older than 12?
Oh, she older than that.

## This gonna get you in trouble?
Not if no one finds out.

## You liked what I brung ya?
Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.

## I put on the lotion you got me. Can you smell it?
I's thinkin' about singing in the choir.

## At church?
Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...

## You gonna sing me somethin'?
When? Now? Oh. No.

## What do you need?
I need ya help again.

## Can I come in?
Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...

## Naw. They got some blue dye, though. You think them boots you got on come from a black cow?
Wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' Laz, there. He the one got this place shakin' back in the day.

## You ain't the kicker, are you?
No, ma'am.

## Can I put it in your mouth?
Okay.

## And, sir... do you have a size in mind for what you're lookin' for?
That young lady's size, right'cher.

## Mind I ask, what's all this business here?
These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.

## For your hands?
I'll take a jar of that, too.

## Still need a lift?
Yeah. Transmission's shot.

## Sit down, man. Need a beer?
Sure.

## What happened?
I guess it could be worse. You could be comin' back in a body bag.

## You been home yet?
Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.

## You need a ride?
This don't feel right. Kitchen looks just like I left it. I know, cuz I cleaned it.

## She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?
I just been so mixed up lately, Gill. And, you know, with her history, I can see how she could get scared... ...and run.

## You gonna steal my truck?
Make yourself at home. You done it already.

## The fuck you laughin' at?
You don't got half what Tehronne got.

## Ronnie ship out this mornin'?
Nothing's gonna happen. Not like everybody over there is in the line of fire with them Arabs blowin' themselves up.

## You wanna go home?
It gets worse there. Leavin' me to my own mind. That's just not good.

## Better?
Yeah.

## Your mother's funeral. I's a pallbearer, remember?
We leavin' this weekend. Deke got a friend in Mobile gonna get him a job at the water company...

## How many times we been over this, Laz? How many times?
Thought we was gonna be friendly about this.

## And you gonna live it with him?
Rose. Folks get sick. But you do what you can to get on the mend. Our marriage... it just got sick. That's all.

## Better'n me?
Better than what you give.

## Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.

## You sayin' you'll do what?
You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..

## You testing me? Huh? You testin' me, old man?
GODDAMMIT, RAE!

## GAL! YOU HEARIN' MY VOICE?
Mm-mm... Mm-mm...

## How long... how long I been out?
You been in and out goin' on two... maybe two days.

## Two days?
After your fever broke, you'd wake up in spells... long enough to get that medicine in ya.

## Where's Ronnie?
Well I don't...

## Why you got me chained?
Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.

## The fuck you been doin' to me?
I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road...

## Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
You know what I'm talkin' about. All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.

## The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are?
I've saved ya life, gal. I can do and say whatever the fuck I want.

## What do you want?
We got everything we need. Plenty of food. Ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it...

## You some kind'a pervert?
Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.

## If I break one you gonna shoot me?
Uh-uh.

## Now that's sharp. That is sharp. Chain give you any trouble?
Uh-uh.

## You take it straight?
Sure.

## We drinkin' buddies now?
To freedom.

## Still makin' jokes?
No joke.

## Could you do somethin' for me?
Anything.

## I had love in my heart. And I gave it to one woman. And she gone now. Where am I gonna put all this love?
Tell me what to do.

## Right here. Be here all afternoon. You ready for this?
I'm gonna just get some girl stuff, like make-up and... stuff.

## You took care of your wife, like you do me?
I tried.

## What is it?
Nothin'.

## By myself?
You can handle it.

## Laz? Can I sleep with you tonight?
Don't think that'd be wise.

## How you feelin' today?
You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more.

## Now that's sharp. That's real sharp. Miss Ella Mae set you up, didn't she? You like it?
I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.

## Well, this one's yours now. You ready to take care of it?
I don't want you to let go.

## She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...

## What'chu sayin'?
She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.

## What'chu sayin'?
What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.

## What'chu sayin'?
What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.

## First hooked up with that bitch when she was 16. Girl was fuckin' the principal and two of her teachers. You know coach Reynolds?
Uh-huh.

## You ever seen a train run on a woman?
Nuh-uh.

## How a girl get like that?
Like I told you.

## Nobody ever asks me to do shit like this for people. And you know what? I'm good at it. Naw what I mean?
You ain't gonna make a fuss, are you? Nothing a man can do when a woman make up her mind.

## You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?
Don't know if God wanna see me.

## Was that Lincoln James I seen run off?
He's fine. Just had a bad fall.

## Why's his britches round his knees?
R.L., you gonna have to get on. I can't have nobody round my place.

## You get a call from Rose?
This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me now.

## Goin' dove huntin'?
You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.

## You sayin' that gun's for me if I don't?
You ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. I got my mind made up and I ain't gonna be moved on this.

## Ain't gonna be moved?
Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...

## Are you outta ya GODDAMN MIND?
Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.

## A naked woman, chained in ya house?
I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home.

## THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT? THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT?
Good. Makin' steaks for supper. I expect you to come.

## You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit.

## Mm. MM. Now these eggs got some kick to it. What'chu got in this?
Ask the chef.

## You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
Not like that.

## Then what?
She's tied to me, R.L.. We tied to each other.

## The hell is this shit?
What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band...

## And now these three remain, faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love. Who gives this girl in marriage?
I do.

## Why she got a chain on her?
That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.

## So... That your first time?
Yes'sir.

## You struck some gold, didn't ya?
I skipped lunch.

## I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?
You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.

## You a preacher?
That's right.

## What's on your mind?
Rae, look at Ronnie. And tell him how you feel.

## You feelin' sick?
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.

## Yeah?
Just about anything, you know. It can be funny or... not. Just tell me somethin'.

## Are you wasted?
Holy shit, Ronnie! You're a fuckin' rock star.

## I'm a what?
All them people shoutin' your name like they were doing tonight! Shit! That arm you got'll get'chu on a box of cereal...

## I feel better. Do you?
Yeah, I do.

## Ronnie...
Did 'ya have fun with her? Sweet as a peach, I bet. Huh? Huh?

## What happened to your face?
Got in a little accident.

## You need money again?
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.

## I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?
I just wanted some make-up.

## The hell are you talkin' about?
I'm sorry... I didn't mean to shout...

## You got any money?
Thought you had a man for that.

## The hell you call me?
Eh, if the bootie fits...

## Hey, hey, where you goin'?
Home.

## What's this?
Let go...

## Why?
I'll get rid of it when you get rid of the egg-beater.

## What are they doing now?
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.

## Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
I don't blame you for being sore. It'll pass when we bag him.

## What?
Frank Abolofia.

## The Wolf?
Some party.

## Maybe we should do something?
Charlie, take your gum, stick it under your ass and keep it warm.

## What are you doing?
Saving your life.

## What'd you say?
Where is the subway station, please.

## Nick... You up?
No.

## Nick, have I been a good partner?
Number five with a bullet.

## This the right place?
I hope not.

## Maybe we should bail?
It's incredible. Hit him or something.

## Squid?
Pussy, ass, soft personnel.

## What'd she say?
That I should let you pay for the drinks. Kampai.

## What does Charlie mean?
Hey, all right.

## Short shift?
Yeah... I came to save you. If you're hopeless, I'll pull the plug.

## All right, how's the new partner?
High spirits, desire, commitment.

## Give me a break, would you?
If you give me one.

## Are you expecting anyone?
I wasn't expecting you.

## Where're you going, Ichiro?
The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's. And call me Ich.

## Why the hell not?
I don't, that's all.

## What happened?
They made you leave your hotel... ... you caused a disturbance.

## Why weren't you at the platform?
I couldn't keep up. My shame is complete.

## You must leave?
Yeah...

## How'd you get this?
I stole them.

## Know her?
We can ask someone I used to work with. A criminal. Someone I pay money to...

## What's he saying?
He says they're very nice. He wants to know if you have anymore.

## Did I say that?
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.

## You're doing fine, Ich. Now drop it, okay?
Sure.

## Where does this Sugai live?
A resort city, Beppu.

## What...? Why?
Because he knows how to get to our man.

## It's a new deal. ... coming with me tomorrow?
Sugai's not going to be impressed with your gun, Nick. No. I won't put myself in danger for you anymore.

## What's in the box?
For Sugai. Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.

## So I bring some cheese?
No...

## How many men?
I couldn't tell.

## Joyce?
I don't know.

## Thank you. You have one?
A wife. She left.

## What's that for?
Luck.

## Why's that?
Because we're the biggest things to hit this town since Godzilla.

## You all right?
Yes...

## Think we'll get him, Nick?
We can't lose.

## How can you be so sure?
Don't give him any more.

## Gaiijin?
An outside person. A foreigner. A barbarian. You, me. More you.

## She ever pull down her shades?
Sure, but then I just pull out the photos.

## Where's Ich?
Unavailable.

## And I'm supposed to care?
You could fake it.

## Where's the wife?
You met her.

## What do you chant?
Nam oyo ranged kyo.' You think it's dumb of course.

## Not if it works. I'll meet you at the train?
I don't remember saying yes.

## Who am I supposed to be?
This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...

## We're in?
The cheese...

## Why would you care?
I still think you're a bastard.

## What if I chant?
Wouldn't help. Watch out for Ich.

## Can't make you change your mind?
Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head.

## How big a package we talking about?
This by this...

## Dope?
Not in that company.

## One guy do all the damage?
Yeah.

## Why?
He's wanted in Japan. They want him first. Then we can have him.

## What?
You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight.

## What...? What if I say no?
Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan. It's a nice, safe country.

## Why me?
They said send a detective if I could spare one. I can always spare you.

## Why don't you ask your chief detective?
Because I want you to tell me.

## What's this?
Your visa has expired. Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.

## The families who control the casinos?
Yes. Unlike our syndicates, your criminals don't understand the words 'honor' and 'duty'... We can't afford not to deal with them.

## Why tell me this?
The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.

## You trust me?
I'll pay you.

## With these?
Swiss bank deposit. Gold bullion. Whatever you want. You know the city and the police.

## If I say no?
You're smarter than Kobo. You know the price of deceit. Think about it.

## If he won't cooperate?
Mr. Sebastian is a host who wants to be appreciated. We'll appreciate him and he'll cooperate.

## I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian. What do you think, Mary?
I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.

## Pris?
Let's go while there is still time.

## Where?
Anywhere.

## What's the point?
Not to be trapped.

## Oh?
Yeah. It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian. Why don't you go home.

## Would you like to be modified?
Had in mind something a little more radical.

## What's the problem?
Death.

## What about E.M.S. recombination?
Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.

## I am?
I've done some questionable things.

## I like a man who stays put. An admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times. You live here all by yourself, do you?
You're just all so... so different.

## What, Sebastian?
You're androids.

## What generation are you?
Nexus - 6.

## Like what?
Like...

## You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems. Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.

## Dr. Tyrell?
He's not really my friend. I just do a job for him now and then.

## He could?
His company made us.

## When do you deliver your project?
This afternoon.

## Where are you going, Sebastian?
Just thought I'd...

## What's going on down there?
He's not ready yet.

## When?
Tomorrow, he says.

## Not if everybody is doing their job here at home. How are things at home?
I think, therefore I am.

## You got a machine on it yet?
We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm. Its guess is that all five are in the city.

## What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
Industrial refuse.

## Garbage man?
Yeah.

## You didn't like her!?
Look, go home. Get some rest. Take an aspirin.

## This is Bryant. Are you alone?
Yeah.

## She's not with you?
Who.

## If you don't, we will. It has to be total, Deckard. That's an order from as high as it comes. Got it?
Yeah. I got it.

## Well, when do you get paid?
Soon as I finish the job.

## When might that be?
Day after tomorrow.

## You equipped for random questions?
Why, yes, of course.

## I think we're through for the night.
How do I stop one?

## Do you have something against science?
Not if it works.

## And what in your estimation works?
The umbrella.

## Never mind. Do they have that knowledge?
Longevity is classified. No.

## Prosit.
I'll but you one. What'll you have?

## You want to see my friends?
Sorry, don't have the time.

## Those cockroaches?
Ya.

## How long you had these guys?
Two months. But this one is not guy. It is girl. His girl.

## One more, eh?
I gotta piss.

## How old am I?
I don't know.

## My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live?
Four years.

## I'm great. I mean, I know I'm not really great, but I feel just great. How you like my new suit?
Well, you don't have to worry about getting it wrinkled.

## Hey, it's okay. I like to pee. So how are you doing?
I'm doing okay.

## From what I hear you're doing great. Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army. Making a lot of money, huh?
Yeah. But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.

## Money?
No. I got a problem.

## What's that?
I'm taking a piss.

## No rust?
I didn't say that. Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.

## Meaning?
Meaning you don't run as fast as you used to.

## Yeah?
Your mind kept wandering. That bothered me.

## What if you change your mind?
They'll change the limit before I change my mind.

## You sure?
Never been more sure of anything in my life.

## Why didn't you go?
Too old.

## But if you could?
My job is here.

## Can I come in?
I'd like you to take a look at these pictures.

## Do you recognize any of them?
This one looks familiar, but I don't know. Naw. There's one came in today looks a little like this one but...

## Who?
The girl that doesn't look like that girl.

## What's suck night?
That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.

## Book the good ones for where?
Lots of places. The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties.

## Yeah?
I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists...

## Are you for real?
Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here. I'd like to check the dressing room if I could.

## What the fuck for?
For holes.

## Of course he's not real. You think I'd be working here if I could afford a real snake?
It's a good job.

## Does it eat?
Come on.

## Hey! Do your job but don't wreck mine, huh?
You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.

## And who do I go to about you?
It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.

## It's artificial?
Of course not.

## Why should I be?
For the responsibility of your power. Being a police bureaucrat, you've got more than your share.

## Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
You show the picture to your husband. He likes it and hangs it on the wall. The girl is lying on a bearskin rug.

## Why not?
That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.

## Is there anything else?
I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.

## So?
So, I'm a piece of equipment. Use me.

## Do I make you nervous?
Yeah.

## What do you want me to do?
Sit.

## You ever take a bath with a man before?
There's a lot I haven't done with a man before.

## You did?
You didn't hear me. You were sleeping.

## Who is this?
Me and my dad.

## Where is he?
Dead.

## How come you're not on the job?
I am. Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.

## How are you doing?
Not too good.

## What do people do in the afternoon?
If they are smart, they take naps.

## Do you dream?
Yeah. Sometimes.

## Did you cry when your father died?
Yeah.

## It wasn't very good last night, was it?
I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to. I guess I thought there was something more to it.

## What?
I don't know... I think I missed something.

## Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
Don't be fooled by appearances.

## It appears to be dirty -- why don't you get somebody?
They could clean around the arrangement.

## You mean a woman?
Uh-huh.

## What's a long time?
Ten years.

## Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?
Because it's not.

## Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.

## Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
No, I don't.

## What difference will it make?
Just wait here.

## What?
That some of the folks around here are more programmed then me.

## Where the hell you been?
You know where I been. I been on vacation.

## What's up?
Holden got hit.

## Bad?
Severed spine. You'd better get in here. Bryant's waiting for you.

## Black?
Please.

## Is this to be an empathy test?
Yes.

## May I ask a personal question?
Go ahead.

## Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
No.

## One that relies on human interpretation. Where's the subject?
Sitting next to you.

## Well?
If she is, the machine works.

## How many questions did it take?
Thirteen.

## She didn't know?
Memory implant. She was programmed. But I think she has transcended her conditioning. I think she was beginning to suspect.

## How many questions does it usually take, Mr. Deckard?
Five, maybe six.

## And how is it one man will be able to cover so much ground?
Discreetly.

## How do you know I'm not?
You're not responding to the stimulus. I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading.

## What desert?
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.

## But how come I'd be there?
Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows. So you look down and see a tortoise. It's crawling towards you...

## Know what a turtle is?
Of course.

## How come you were in my truck?
I was tired and didn't have any place to go.

## What's your name?
Pris.

## You want to go home?
I don't have one.

## Where are your folks?
They left.

## What about friends?
I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying.

## We scared each other pretty good didn't we?
We sure did.

## I've got stuff. If you wanna go to my place?
I was hoping you'd say that.

## Whatcha doin'?
You scared me.

## And you live in this building all by yourself?
Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now...

## What's your problem?
Methuselah Syndrome.

## What's that?
My glands. They grow old too fast.

## Is that why you're still here?
Yes. I couldn't pass the test.

## Ah, you get hold of your friends?
As a matter of fact I did. They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.

## What makes you think so?
I was wondering if you might help me. I...I seem to have lost my Congressional Medal of Honor somewhere around here.

## No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
Really?

## She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
Sure.

## How do you do?
Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.

## Come where?
My office.

## For how long?
Please excuse this interruption.

## Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself.
Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?

## Do ya?
No. I'm from out of town. I'm here on business.

## Where are we going?
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.

## Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
Forget it. I'm sick of working for that dickhead.

## Dickhead?
A walking penis capable of intelligent speech. A dickhead.

## What's wrong with you?
I just had a mental picture of...

## I don't know. Why doesn't it?
Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.

## Yes, I'm right?
Right.

## Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?

## Do you own a car?
I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America, No strangers in the car.

## You don't?
He's all yours. I was holding him back.

## So for four thousand dollars, all I have to do is drive you to your hotel?
Yes.

## And that's it?
Yes.

## Okay. What the hell? You got a deal. Get in.
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?

## So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?
Oh, I could die...

## Okay.
Over this?

## Why are you doing that?
No.

## Hey, no kidding? In color?
Cross my heart and hope to die.

## ...Okay.
Why doesn't it never work out?

## Doing what?
Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.

## Food and supplies? Who for? Like starving people?
Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.

## How long would you need me?
Two weeks.

## What's fair?
I've got to make at least a thousand a week.

## Why not buy them milk or something-- instead of Dr. Pepper?
They like Dr. Pepper.

## Who are these people?
My Mom and Dad.

## Adam? Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry. I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
Okay.

## No, no! I'm sorry! What is it?
This is for me.

## A wife?
Yes.

## What for?
Sure.

## They're all divorced?
Everybody's divorced.

## I wouldn't know. What kind of wife are you looking for?
One who's not a mutant.

## When do you need her by?
Two weeks.

## Could we talk about that a little later?
Of course.

## Why, thank you! Very nice to have met you, Cliff! May I ask you a question?
Um-hum.

## Good for you.
I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North. Are we getting hot?

## Where's he gone?
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.

## He has a computer?
Sure.

## In the house?
No. We keep it in the backyard. Of course, in the house. It's in there.

## May I please be excused?
Uh...yeah.

## About clothing?
Yeah.

## Have you ever heard the saying, \"He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?\"
What about holding your right arm up like that all the time?

## What have you ordered?
It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink, I'm told.

## What about her?
No way.

## Adam! She's got bitch written all over her! You do know what \"bitch\" means, don't you?
Okay. I like that.

## Yeah. Could be. Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.
What do I say to Miss Sweet when I meet her?

## Okay. All right. And what do I say?
Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be.

## What?
Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.

## Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.

## Is that what you call it?
Sing it to me.

## Adam...dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?
No.

## Yes, Eve?
I want you to go back to the hotel now. I'll call you a cab.

## That's right. And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby. Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?
Not at all. And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.

## What?
Nothing.

## A card?
Yes.

## The front door is open. Will you be back?
I promise.

## They're pretty. Can I have them?
Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.

## What's baseball?
It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.

## Like a painting?
No, son. A pitcher.

## Like one of Mom's?
Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.

## The nocturnal flying mammal?
No. Sit down.

## Shit is a French word?
C'est bon, Monsieur.

## Yes, father?! Yes?
...the pipe tobacco.

## Adult Bookstore. Why?
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.

## I promise. Is that all?
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.

## This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it?
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.

## You're sure?
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.

## That's what everybody believes?
Yes, sir. It's true.

## I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
Not particularly.

## And it's called...?
Maybe Eve can guess. She's psychic.

## Really? Since when?
Right on the button.

## That's right?
I've never met anyone like you in my life.

## Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a few questions. When did Alaska become a state?
1959.

## Who use to own it?
Russia.

## When did we get it from them?
1867. Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.

## What's the capitol?
Juneau.

## What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?
I don't think so.

## You don't have a computer in your cabin?
No.

## How do you get through those winters? Well, you're right. Juneau. What's the highest peak?
Mt. McKinley. It's also the highest point in North America.

## Yeah?
Oh, yes. It would probably kill him.

## He's a Windows guy then, huh?
Yes. He likes windows.

## Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.

## Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that?
A magazine? A toy perhaps? In the bookstore.

## Does that work?
You dial nine to get out.

## Of what?
The hotel.

## How old are you?
Thirty-five.

## How old do I look?
Twenty-five? Around there.

## Up here on the fifteenth floor?
Yes, please. I'm looking for all beef patties.

## Come on. Frozen. How much are they?
Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.

## Hi.
Whatcha looking at?

## How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?
I was thinking of selling all the cards.

## Really? No kidding?
See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller. Ones, fives, tens. Like that.

## Oh, you got a problem with that?
I didn't want to leave without saying how much I admire your jewelry.

## Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your butt?
Oh. A nice one, I hope.

## Yes?
Yes, ma'am.

## What?
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.

## What about relatives?
All back East.

## He drank it hot?
Yeah.

## Good.
You got a light, honey?

## Yes, yes, the song. So tell me...has it been...hell up here?
It's time.

## Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
Yeah, yeah. Okay. Give me the roast and watch your step. I'll come back for the radio.

## How long will we have to stay down here?
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.

## To you maybe.
Days?

## What's that noise?
The locks.

## The locks?
To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.

## Hi, honey! Feeling better?
No.

## Really?
Maybe I've just got the creeps.

## What?
Uh, oh. Now it's time.

## Is there a problem?
No, Calvin. Babies cry.

## What shall we call him?
Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.

## You bet.
Why?

## Yes...
No kidding. Who else would have done it?

## Would you excuse me?
Sure.

## In the generator room again?
Oh, yes. It just fascinates me how all these things work.

## Should we say a little prayer first?
Just open the door.

## Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
We stay down here.

## We do?
Yes.

## How long will you set it for this time?
I thought ten years.

## What are you doing here?
I forgot some of my stuff.

## Hey, they're Ralph Laurens. And who's this interesting looking fellow?
You know, I don't know. And looking at you, I don't care. It's been too long, Eve.

## So, Adam...where on earth are you from?
Out-of-town. That's all he'll say.

## I even guessed his hotel, didn't I?
Give me your hand.

## What's that supposed to mean?
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.

## Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
That's what I'm sensing.

## Well, what do you think?
Uh..he might of.

## What's that mean?
We did not leave together.

## I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
To bed.

## To bed?
Yeah. I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.

## Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
What?

## Where did he get all that information?
Fallout shelter.

## What do you want to do with it?
Give it back to him.

## And if we can't find him?
We'll find him.

## Yeah! That's thinking.
What's wrong?

## An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?
Come on.

## Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?
None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.

## I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you?
Um...uh...

## Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem here.
Buy it from me?

## Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
Stand by. One.

## I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
Roger, Wolf One. Can you make it to the ocean?

## Yeah. How's Dad?
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.

## Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.

## Doctor Gynde, my whole family's sick. What's going on?
I'm not sick.

## Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.

## Oh yeah? Have you seen any?
I've seen a few.

## Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
Darling, where are the glasses? Oh, here they are.

## Are you Detective Williams?
Yes.

## You did? A human ear?
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.

## Yes?
If you want to come up a minute, I'll show you some pictures.

## These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
Okay.

## Anything you can tell me?
The criminals are winning.

## Is that why you say it's horrible?
Yes.

## Why do you do it?
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.

## What is this? What color is it?
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.

## What color is it?
It's blue. Blue velvet.

## Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.

## Is Sandy part of this?
No, not at all.

## Who knows you have these?
Only you and the photo lab.

## You're all through with this now?
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.

## Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Not yet.

## Yes? What is it?
Pest control, gotta do your apartment.

## Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
Jeffrey nothing.

## You tell me!! Let me see that wallet. Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
I wanted to see you.

## What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
Nobody.

## That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
Well.

## THEN WHAT?
Then you got undressed.

## How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
Never before this.

## What do you want from me?
I, I don't know.

## Do you like that?
Yes.

## Do you like talk like that?
No.

## Nothing. Are you alright?
Sure I'm alright.

## Don?
No.

## Do you like the way I feel?
Yes.

## See my breasts? See?
Yes.

## See my nipples?
Yes.

## Do you like me?
Yes, I like you.

## Do you know?
No.

## No. What is happening?
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.

## Hi, can I come in?
Yeah, hurry up though.

## Why are you here. Whatiya want?
I, uh.

## Frank? Can you stand up?
I'm alright. Go hide. This won't take long. Be quiet.

## Nice guy. Who's he?
Who's it, you mean.

## Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway? Why are you in so much trouble?
Look.

## Don? Are you in with them?
No. But you're in very big trouble.

## Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?
No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay. Don't hate me.

## Do you like my body?
Sure I do.

## What do you want to do?
I'm doing it.

## Whatiya mean?
Do you want to do bad things? Anything, anything.

## What do you want?
Yes.

## That wouldn't be too good, would it?
Frank would open you.

## Does that scare you?
Shut up.

## Look, snap out of it, will ya?
Kiss me.

## Do you love me?
I asked first.

## You what?
You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.

## I did. Are you?
Yes.

## What?
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.

## Hold me, Don.
Who, Dorothy?

## Frank gone?
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.

## He's comin' back? What for?
Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.

## Oh he forced you, huh?
No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.

## Who's this fuck?
He's a friend. From the neighborhood. We were just talking.

## Where are we going, Frank?
Hey Tits, I'm taking your neighbor to the country. Maybe something for you too.

## You want to see him too, right?
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.

## Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
Those are my breasts.

## Can I feel 'em?
If you want to.

## We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.

## Yeah. I guess I did. What's going to happen to me?
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.

## Hello?
Speak to me Fucker.

## No thanks. What does that mean?
I don't want to go.

## Go where?
On a ride.

## What?
Let's take our neighbor out. Let him fuckin' walk back.

## What are you lookin' at?
Nothing.

## Don't look at me, Fuck. I shoot when I see the whites of the eyes. You like me?
Yes.

## Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer.

## Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
This is it.

## What time are visiting hours?
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.

## Yeah?
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.

## What?
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.

## Do you want the car?
No, I'm just gonna walk around.

## Can I use the car tonight?
Of course, Jeffrey.

## Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
Nothing. I'm fine.

## Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.

## Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Alright.

## Would you like a piece of cake?
No. No thank you.

## Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?

## Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. Just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.

## Uh-uh.
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?

## Are you feeling okay?
Uh-uh.

## How ya doin' Dad?
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.

## Yeah, how did you know?
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.

## You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.

## No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
Yes.

## How is Central these days?
Terrible boring.

## Yeah. What are you doing now?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.

## The ear is from a missing person maybe?
Maybe so.

## I guess you have to get back home soon?
Not really, why? You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you.

## Where are they?
I don't know, you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you.

## Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.

## Yeah, I guess so. What are you going to do now that you're home?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.

## What happened to him?
I don't know. He moved away.

## You hungry or thirsty, or both?
I don't know.

## I'm here, aren't I?
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.

## What will I say when she comes to the door?
I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.

## Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.

## Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.

## Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
I owe you, since I goofed up this one.

## You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?
Yes. I do.

## You really want to do this, don't you?
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.

## Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.

## Why not?
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.

## It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
Yeah, but.

## Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
OK.

## Oh, okay, can I call?
Okay, yeah, call.

## Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
Yeah.

## I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
Okay, thanks.

## That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?
Okay, okay. Bye.

## Well, how did it go? What happened?
Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.

## What's with Mike?
He got a little jealous.

## You want a Dairy Queen?
No way. I'm about to blow up.

## Wow. Should you tell my father?
I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.

## Twice. Without her sensing anything?
Yes.

## Did you see her undressed?
Yeah. I mean a little, you know.

## Who, me? Why should it?
That's what I thought.

## Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?
Yeah I guess so. You're a neat girl.

## I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
Okay, be careful.

## Can I give you a kiss good night?
You better not, Jeffrey.

## You want to go talk to him?
Yeah, but I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.

## That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Shoot.

## Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?
Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.

## Oh yeah?
Jeffrey!!

## I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
Yeah.

## Jeffrey? Why?
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.

## You like mysteries that much?
Yeah, you're a mystery. I like you. Very much.

## You worry about me really?
Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this.

## You didn't tell him about me?
No.

## What is it?
Just some fatherly advice.

## What was that all about?
Nothing, really! It's good to see you.

## Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.

## Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
I like that idea, that's a real good idea.

## You want to dance?
I can't dance fast.

## Really. You want to dance with someone else?
NO.

## You want to dance?
Okay.

## Dorothy Vallens?
Yes.

## Probably not. No. Why?
Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.

## Jeffrey? What's going on?
Shhh. I'll tell you.

## Yeah, nice meetin' you.
Sandy?

## What are watchin' this junk for?
You can change it if you want to.

## Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute?
Sure, just a sec. Excuse me.

## Come on out a minute, okay?
Okay.

## What did he bring him in for?
Needed an outsider. The package boy knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters a mile away.

## Up where?
Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.

## The Duke? What did you do?
Listen kid, I think you better understand who you're dealing with here.

## What did you do, Connor?
Aye.

## Are these me considered armed and dangerous?
Well, not armed. If they had guns, they'd have used them. But dangerous? Oh yeah.

## Any word back from the E.R.s?
Ah, Agent Smecker, we have a problem.

## This is a six-shooter.
What?

## Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and out. Boy, you guys sure did a good job. You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd you get them?
Let's do him right here.

## Anybody you think is evil?
Yes.

## Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?
Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don Rocco.

## What are you saying?
Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.

## Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys decide who you're... I mean, who makes the cut? Is there a raffle or something?
I-I'll tip her.

## What? What is it?
This place is like a scumbag yard sale.

## What? What, that guy?
They got nothing.

## You guys?
We're here brother.

## Mother, is that you?
Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.

## Ma, what's wrong?
Mother, what are you sayin'? You're talkin' crazy here.

## What?! What are you doin'?
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.

## How's Uncle Sibeal?
Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.

## Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
All right, I suppose you have the right ta know.

## You guys are not under oath, here. I am assuming you knew these two guys from before, huh?
We... met them last night.

## So, how is it that you guys are fluent in Russian?
We paid attention in school.

## Know any other languages?
Well, we could try the bag over the head thing. Walk you right out the front.

## So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?
I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.

## I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
Be careful.

## What are you going to do?
We're going to turn ourselves in. It was self defense.

## Hey Murphy?
Aye.

## How many?
Two. One ta screw it in and one ta suck my cock.

## All right, love ya ma. Listen, before ya go just give us the goods, eh?
Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years.

## How do you think he figured all this out without talking to us?
Italian.

## For what?
Charlie Bronson's always got rope.

## What?
Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.

## Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
I'm serious.

## Is that right, Rambo?
All right, get the stupid fuckin' rope.

## Nervous?
A bit.

## Where the fuck are you going?
We'll find it. Just calm down.

## Oh, you're good. What were you gonna do? Laugh the last three to death, funny man?
Mafiosos getting caught with 20 kilos and walkin' on bail the same day.

## Where are you goin'? Did you tell him?
Yes.

## So what do you think?
I'm strangely comfortable with it.

## So, when are you getting a plastic fuck doll?
Give the guy a shot.

## Okay, just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is...
There he goes. Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord?

## Yeah?
I knew you two pricks would give me problems. Give me shit cause I'm a woman. I'm not gonna take your male dominance bullshit!

## Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck face?
That depends. You either do your job or get ethical.

## Can she I.D. them?
They were wearing masks.

## Of course they were. How many?
Three.

## Only two did the shooting. So what are you thinking, Russian retaliation?
Maybe the three of them had something in common.

## How do you figure?
So Duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie.

## The what man?
The fat man.

## Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon?
He was the only one done right. Two in the back of the head.

## Now, what is this going to look like to those who do not know what I just told you?
It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.

## No way they could have seen it?
Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.

## Why was I not informed of this?
Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.

## Detective Greenly. Who the fuck are you?
Respect is earned, Greenly, never given. Guys like you should have to follow me around squabbling for the scraps from my table.

## How many bodies, Greenly?
Eight.

## Witness?
No way they could have seen it.

## Who were the victims?
I got it ta my head now. I got it ta my head now.

## Just called ta torture us did ya?
But he's been havin' himself a nip or two as well... Been up the waitress' skirt all night, poor girl.

## So you're not just talkin' mob guys. You're talkin' anyone, right? Even like pimps and drug dealers and all that shit?
Well fuck, you guys could do this every day.

## What are you serious?
Yeah, fuck it. If you think about it, it's all you can do really. You can't tell him it was us. Go in braggin' and shit.

## Hello?
Hey Murph.

## No. You sure you're okay?
I'm fuckin' fine. Catch you on the flip side.

## Hello?
Hey, Murph.

## No. You sure you're okay?
Y'know it is, a bit.

## So let's kill the motherfucker. I mean, what are you guys... like that's your new thing right?
Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps.

## Well, what'ya do?
You look like Mush Mouth from Fat Albert.

## What the fuck do you mean?
I mean he ain't here.

## Hello? You there?
Y-Yes my son.

## Why have you come to a church for council if you're not religious?
Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should.

## What is it my son?
God's permission? God doesn't...

## You believe?
Yes.

## You feel?
Yes.

## Has he now?
I guess not.

## You know them personally?
Yes.

## Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
No. They would never do that.

## You gonna do what I say, got it?
That's who I'm doing this for, now open the fuckin' thing.

## What do you want me to say?
Just be natural, goddamit.

## How long since your last confession, my son?
Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.

## Yeah boss?
The... The funny man.

## What color hair does he have?
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.

## Making Hutch David Soul?
He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.

## Why?
As part of his plan. I don't know why.

## What does Starsky say?
He says. This is he.

## This is he?
No. This is he.

## Did you see what I meant about the window?
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.

## Would they do that?
Who knows? That's why I filed it down.

## What do you think the cops have?
Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. That's less than what it's appraised at.

## But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
I know about money, Anthony. I know the value of money. Plus the earrings are worth three times that.

## Where are you going?
I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.

## How was I ridiculing you?
You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.

## Did you see that?
Yeah, I saw it.

## Holy shit. What'd I tell you?
Eight dollars.

## Is it back in?
Yeah.

## There's another stocker, right?
We know there's another stocker.

## Is that the manager?
Unlock that door. Check the aisles.

## What about what that guy said?
Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you.

## What do you think?
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.

## Can I get that credit card from you?
I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.

## Why not?
Because my mom gets the bill.

## What about them?
They obviously weren't designed for racing.

## Bob?
Look, man. She didn't know anything about shirts.

## Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?
Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.

## Even if it's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not?
I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.

## May I have a word with you, please?
Sure.

## Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?
No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.

## They don't?
No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.

## Which one was that?
On the left.

## Bob?
See, now we've got a plan.

## Where was it parked?
Right here.

## When'd he tell you?
This morning.

## Where was I?
You were asleep.

## I have an idea for that.
If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?

## Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she? Doesn't she?
I don't think we can do that.

## Where's the rest?
I had to give some to Inez.

## How much?
$383.

## You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem?
Ah. Couple days ago.

## That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
Sure.

## You really hit a guy with a bottle?
I want you to look at this.

## What is it?
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.

## What's Hinckley Cold Storage?
Mr. Henry has an inside source. We call him Steve. That's where we get our information.

## Who's Mr. Henry?
You'll meet him this afternoon. He's helping us set it up.

## What exactly is this place? Freezers?
Right. Freezers. Imported foods.

## What time did he say to be here?
Right now.

## What do you think?
He seems pretty good.

## What the fuck are we doing out here?
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.

## OK. Man in blue jeans just left by southwest door. He is entering a white van. What time is it?
Eleven fifteen.

## Did that hurt?
I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.

## As a person?
Yeah. As a girl.

## We all set?
Hang on a second.

## Uh-huh?
Take your second position.

## Any activity?
Not at all. The place is totally deserted.

## What's happening? What's going on?
It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted.

## Who did that? What the fuck is that?
It's going back down.

## Careful. Check his pulse.
Applejack! What's happening?

## Who tripped the alarm?
It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.

## Where's Kumar?
I don't know.

## What are you doing?
Let's go. Come on.

## Applejack's stuck in the elevator?
Come on.

## What?
I'll see you there.

## What are you talking about?
I'll get him.

## So is Mr. Henry going to come by and see me or anything?
I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.

## He did?
Yeah.

## What'd he get?
Pretty much everything.

## You think Applejack knew?
We haven't heard from Applejack since he got out of the hospital. His case got dismissed.

## Why?
We're not sure.

## What do you mean?
Nothing.

## You're living on a sailboat?
It belongs to Bob's uncle.

## Where?
Behind Bob's house.

## Does it float?
We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.

## So how is it in there?
What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to.

## What's he in for?
He stole a tractor.

## How?
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.

## Shield me from the bullets. They won't shoot civilians. Ready?
This is my business manager, Rowboat.

## Technique. That's right. Seventy- five percent of your job is crowd control. Seventy-five percent. Do you believe that?
I'd like to live in that place. Hinckley Cold Storage.

## You mean a safecracker?
Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want, Kumar Banijamali.

## I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.

## What do you mean?
The Abe Henry double-cross test. You just made a perfect score.

## That was a test?
Take a deep breath.

## How does that feel?
It feels good.

## Did Dignan take the test?
Yes, he did.

## How'd he do?
That sounds like Dignan.

## Me?
No, that door over there.

## Are you afraid?
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.

## The fear of death, The pain of consciousness. Did you mix this martini?
No. Bob did.

## Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
Anthony, I'm petrified.

## Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
Absolutely.

## Why'd you want to help us?
Because I was like you once. And there was no one there to help me.

## Who?
Future Man. You know. Cause he looks like he's from the future.

## Did you ever steal a car before?
Yeah. I've stolen two cars before. One Jaguar. And one Trans-Am. With T- Tops. That Trans-Am was fun to drive.

## In your backyard? How do you protect them?
It's private property. Plus I have Hector.

## Could you grow cinnamon?
I don't know. Sure, I guess.

## Are you serious?
Yeah. He said that.

## What was that?
What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them.

## Where you going?
Move.

## You think he got my license plates?
He looked too shaken-up.

## How long are they going to hold him?
I'm not playing any more golf.

## Why not?
Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.

## You think I'm improving?
Yes. You just got to stick with it.

## Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
Prison tatoos. I got to be pretty good. It's not like drawing on paper.

## Why do you say that?
Well, because you guys don't look alike.

## Was Future Man adopted?
Jesus Christ! No.

## No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing. I was just asking.

## No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel fine. You want a piece of cake?
Sure.

## What are you doing?
My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.

## Let me see it. Did you drop it?
No.

## Temporarily.
Who's got the car keys?

## How do you say nineteen?
Dies y nueve.

## Are you ever scared of finding a dead body in one of these rooms?
No.

## Were you born in Mexico?
Cuba.

## Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?
God, yes. Like silk.

## Like silk?
God. That does sound corny. Oh, your skin feels so soft and silky. But it really kind of does.

## You're Anthony?
Yeah.

## Did you ever hear of the S. Cooper Trust robbery?
Uh-uh.

## S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
Uh-uh.

## Abdul-Shabazz?
I can knock a man out with a six inch punch.

## What do you mean?
Feel this.

## Where'd they come from?
The front stairs.

## Where were you?
Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.

## Is that him?
Wait a second.

## That's your friend Anthony?
Yeah.

## What's he doing here?
Looks like he's staying with Buckethead. That's what I figured. He's probably got his own room. Let's see where he's going.

## Wait. Did he see us?
We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him.

## Mr. Henry pulled that job in 1965. It's famous. Applejack was the wheel man. Did you use this same car, Applejack?
Hell, no. This is a '72. I was driving a '63 Pontiac.

## Are you a fag?
You're the faggot.

## I don't know, Bob. What about one of those?
I'm not allowed to drive those.

## Not even for emergencies?
No.

## So who's going to know?
My brother.

## What are you talking about, Bob?
Can you use a coaster.

## Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
I'll just drive my car.

## If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
Good question.

## What was that all about?
I can't believe you said that.

## What did I say?
I told you he's crazy.

## Where'd she go?
Maybe she turned.

## Yeah, but what if some nut pulled gun on you?
You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year.

## His name was Swifty?
Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.

## What are you doing?
I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.

## What happened?
Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.

## Did we get it?
Be cool, Bob. Be cool. Make that light.

## How much is there?
Don't count it.

## You really think he'll remember you?
No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.

## Bob, will you please listen?
I don't want to talk about it.

## So it's my fault?
There were more than that.

## Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do that for?
He wouldn't move.

## Is he chasing us?
I don't know.

## What the fuck possessed you?
You're the one who kept saying ram him.

## Bob. Are you coming?
See you in a little while.

## What are you talking about?
The weed.

## But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
They said he's a drug dealer.

## I don't think they can make it stick, Bob. I mean, what do they actually have on Future Man?
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.

## So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
I was just going to use it to see how much I had.

## How long has he been in there?
I don't know.

## What do you mean get back?
Well, obviously, we got to go back.

## What is it?
Just get in the car, Bob.

## What's his name?
It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan.

## Hey, Dignan. How's it going?
Not bad.

## Come on in. What you been up to?
Man, I don't want to go into this.

## Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.

## Stand by. Bird Dog?
I couldn't hear anything.

## What's wrong with Applejack?
I think so.

## Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
I didn't think there was an alarm.

## Where's Applejack?
He's stuck between two floors.

## What's that?
That's just what the DA asked. CRS is a disease where you can't remember shit.

## Do you have your own room?
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.

## Do you have your own cell?
I'm working on it.

## You keeping out of trouble?
I'm trying.

## He said what?
He said you ran away from home.

## How long do you have to go?
26 weeks.

## And what does that cover?
Social issues. Crime prevention.

## Hand to hand combat?
Ground defense.

## Dignan. Good to see you. Good to see you Applejack. Who are you?
This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.

## What do you mean grammar?
The basic grammatical rules of robbing.

## The grammar?
Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.

## Is he good?
He's damn good.

## You got to have fun with it. There's no point if you're not having any fun. Would you like me to be there tomorrow?
Yes.

## Well, I think --
Why?

## Why did he go that way?
He's going to watch the back stairwell, remember? Don't worry about it.

## What's the story?
Can't get it. It won't...

## What can we do?
We're closed, sir.

## Where's that guy going?
He left his sweater.

## Where?
In the cash register. Step away from the door.

## Where is he? Where is Rob?
I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.

## Hello, my friend. You in the Army, yes?
No. I just have short hair.

## Is that your chiquita?
No, my friend knows her.

## You like Chicanos?
Sure.

## Where's your friend? He go with the chiquita?
I don't know.

## What?
Fight. You know.

## You Hoto?
Fuck you. You a Hoto.

## No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?
Right.

## The world needs dreamers, son.
How's the weather down there?

## What?
The world needs dreamers. To relieve the pain of consciousness.

## Will it track back to us?
No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.

## And the Landy woman?
She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account...

## Anything else?
Neski was a roadblock. Without me, there's no company, no fortune. You owe me, Uri. One last push.

## What do you mean?
Go to the airport. Get a plane. I'll have a brass band waiting for you.

## What?
He left yesterday on the night train. He's probably just getting in now. You'll have to hurry.

## Bourne comes here? Why?
Treadstone.

## And what are we looking for?
I want to know about Treadstone.

## What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?
I want to know what happened.

## Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?
...this is Conklin's computer.

## Do you know what his budget was?
Excuse me.

## And you do? From the moment he left Treadstone, he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him...
May I finish?

## Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers?
Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.

## So what's he doing? You believe him?
Sorry to wake you.

## What?
They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.

## Did he say anything to you?
No... It must have been Bourne.

## Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
Don't know.

## And Danny Zorn, what was that?
Had to be done.

## No good options left?
No. You lost your way.

## She say what time I should call?
The sooner the better.

## It was staged?
Is it a slam dunk? No, but...

## Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
Keep going...

## Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin. Who's been in Berlin?
Lots of people...

## Nobody. You. I had to tell you, right?
Show me again...

## It's nice. Does this picture mean anything to you? Hmm?
It's nothing. It's just a picture.

## It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?
Yes...

## Then what?
I killed them.

## How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
I don't want you to forgive me.

## Is this really happening?
I'm sorry.

## So why didn't you kill me then?
She wouldn't let me. She's the only reason you're alive.

## What do you want?
Conklin.

## You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?
I don't know.

## Who sent you to Greece?
A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.

## Pamela Landy?
I don't know who that is.

## I don't know! Why would I lie?
I did.

## You called it in?
We write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good.

## I'm trying, Marie, Okay?
I worry when you get like this.

## No... How?
The Telegraph office.

## But you're sure?
He was at the campground yesterday.

## It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?
That's crazy.

## You keep going to the shack. I'll meet you there in an hour.
What?

## Where are you going?
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.

## What if it's not who you think it is?
If he crosses the bridge, it is.

## You do?
I only dream about people who are dead.

## See that tram coming around the corner?
Yes.

## Who is Pamela Landy?
You hear me? I believed you.

## What is this, a game?
I want to hear it from you.

## A Russian?
It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.

## Last week? When?
And you got to him before we could.

## I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.
I killed him?

## Abbott?
He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...

## For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
No. You never worked Berlin.

## What do you want?
I want to come in.

## Okay, how do you want to do it?
I want someone I know to take me in.

## Who?
There was a girl in Paris. Part of the program. She used to handle the medication.

## Where am I?
Ramstein Air Base, Germany. Before the wall fell you would have woken up in a Russian prison hospital.

## Are you disappointed?
Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie.

## Do you think you can read? Are you well enough?
Don't need it. I remember everything.

## And the Germans can't match it?
Looks like he's been detained.

## Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
I want to look at the room. Check it out.

## What?
This stays between you and I. We finally have an edge. I don't want to lose it.

## What? The tapes?
Hold on... Yep. And Abbott just direct dialed Moscow from his room...

## Here?
That's where we came out.

## How long have you worked for the agency?
Me? Four years.

## I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear?
Yes, sir -- ma'am...

## Amnesia?
Before this? Before Bourne? No.

## Are you an expert in amnesia?
Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.

## Believed what?
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.

## Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story. Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through?
You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.

## Did you?
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.

## And why is that?
Because he's doing just what he said he'd do. He's coming for us.

## Is it fresh?
It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know.

## What do you think? Is he coming in?
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.

## So?
Felt promising. It's a start.

## Do we know what this says?
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.

## By who?
His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself.

## Are we hacking or asking?
Yes. In that order.

## We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.

## Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment?
It was in Latin, sir.

## What are they doing?
Saying goodbye in their own way -- in outlawed tartans, with outlawed pipes, playing outlawed tunes.

## But... what will you do?
I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.

## Does anyone know his politics?
No. But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass, so we must.

## May he rest in peace... You have already sealed the coffin?
He was a modest man.

## I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?

## What news of the north?
Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.

## The Scots will fight for us?
What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.

## Now, my flower, do you understand?
Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.

## You mock us with a smile?
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.

## Is it true? Wallace is captured?
Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation.

## When will his trial be?
Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed.

## Stephen ready?
I wanna have supper waitin'.

## Can you do it when it matters? As it matters in battle? Could you crush a man with that throw?
I could crush you like a roach.

## Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty?
Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald Isle of course, more's the pity.

## Where is my son?
If he wants his queen to rule, then you stay and learn how! I will deal with him.

## You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.

## I have faced him. Have you?
Let her speak.

## Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive they purification... And in the end, I promise you'll beg for the axe.
Treason. Against whom?

## Your father doesn't like me, does he?
It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.

## Did it work?
No. You don't choose your dreams. Your dreams choose you.

## How do you know this?
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.

## Wife of Edward, the king's son?
I come as the king's servant, and with his authority.

## But now that I am here, will you speak with a woman?
I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight.

## Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
That is not possible.

## Why did you?
Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way... as when we met.

## No. But can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost? Or simply love me... because I love you?
M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.

## Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.

## And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why.

## What's the crazy man saying, Lord?
The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.

## Who would do such a thing?
Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field.

## Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture?
Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...

## What?
When I asked Evan about his drawing, well, he didn't remember doing it.

## Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
Hold it, hold it, Andrea. Let's not jump to conclusions. I'll run some preliminary tests, see what we can rule out.

## Why? What for?
Well, the good news is that the results are negative. I've found no evidence in the way of lesions, hemorrhaging, tumors...

## And the bad news?
Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.

## But you must have something to go on?
If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.

## But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.

## When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
You know the answer to that.

## Can't he come out for one day?
We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.

## I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
No.

## My father has a bad memory, too?
These'll bring you luck, Crockett.

## Honey. What were you doing with that?
I... I don't remember.

## Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay?
Okay.

## Something must've happened! What set him off?
I... I blacked out.

## Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.

## Why do you ask?
No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.

## What? What could he do?
...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient.

## How long will I be in here?
I don't know. These things take time.

## How's Kayleigh doing? She all right?
I found these. The others are still in storage.

## Okay, doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got?
Cute, Evan.

## What does that mean for Evan?
There must be a way to fix this.

## Fix?
I just need the entry about the blockbuster. Wait, shit, no arms. I never even got the chance to write it.

## How. Did you. Know that?
You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you.

## Can you protect me?
Jesus himself couldn't make me take on the Brotherhood. When they come, just put your mind in another place, man. Be somewhere else.

## Weirder than this?
Marks, scars, I dunno. Anything could happen I guess.

## So you believe me?
Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you. He's as handsome as his father.

## Dad lives here?
Not in this wing, actually. No.

## Where are you now?
I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.

## Are you hurting her?
No, protecting her.

## Okay. Then go a little forward in time. What do you see now?
I see a car.

## Are you sure? Not even with my father?
This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex.

## Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored?
Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour.

## My journals! Where are they?
Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...

## Photos?
Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.

## You really think he wanted to kill you?
Shhh! I need quiet for this.

## Huh?
Fuck off, frat boy.

## I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea.
Oh God... what did we do?

## You really don't remember anything that happened?
Ouch.

## Damn. Your dad did this?
I deserve a lot worse.

## I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.

## He must be. They're letting him go, right?
Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.

## God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been?
Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...

## So how's Tommy?
They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.

## Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
She had a new family. Not enough space for me. Said I should have moved in with her when we were kids. But... whatever.

## Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
Of course.

## It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
It was a long time ago.

## Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
No, but I think something really bad might've happened to us.

## Where... where are my clothes?
Those are your clothes, silly.

## Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?
I dunno. Just being weird.

## So it didn't feel... weird?
Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms weird.

## I don't understand, where are you taking me?
You'll see.

## Why are you doing all this for me?
Simple math. When I woke up this morning and saw your smile... I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.

## Like how?
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.

## I walk differently?
I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...

## Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone.
Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?

## Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?
So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.

## Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.

## Ha! Where's that?
The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.

## What's happened to you?
You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, \"You wouldn't believe me\", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.

## Why's that?
Because you're... different.

## Different? How?
Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.

## Yeah?
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.

## Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
You're right, Evan, I don't believe you.

## I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.

## Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.

## Know what?
That I didn't leave you there to rot.

## Which is?
There is no fuckin' way on this planet or any other that I was in some fuckin' sorority.

## Sure you don't want your wallet?
Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.

## Where are we going?
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.

## Is something the matter?
Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something.

## Kayleigh? Do you ever think about \"us?\" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?
Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.

## I was?
That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.

## I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
It's crossed my mind from time to time.

## Then you think it might have worked out?
Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends.

## We're really gonna be in a movie!?
That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.

## Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go?
Calm down, kid. Stand still.

## I was just somewhere else -- how did I get here?
Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.

## What time is it?
It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.

## Who -- who are you?
...yes.

## There is no \"right\". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were.
It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?

## Who's to say you can't make things better?
You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother.

## Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?
We'll find out soon enough.

## I'm not sure. I might have gotten some stories mixed up. Did Pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts?
Hey, I got no choice.

## Just don't drop the ball, okay?
I won't let you down, Professor Carter.

## And you are...?
Evan Treborn.

## So what's the point?
Maybe if I can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function, it'll help me understand the complexities of the human brain.

## Can... can... Can I have this?
Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway.

## Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
Drop it or I'll slit your mother's throat in her sleep.

## Are you sure you even packed it?
My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see.

## What?
Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.

## Destroy it?
If I hadn't blown my arms off, Mom never woulda started smoking in the first place. Now shhhh.

## Hey, what'd you do that for?
Fat little baby, crying for mommy.

## Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. What's up already?
Hold your horses, man. It's here somewhere. I saw it when I was a kid.

## What the hell are you doing?
It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.

## Lung cancer?
Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately.

## Huh?
Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.

## None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
Sorry. Never heard of her.

## What did I say about mentioning that bitch?
Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.

## Wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted. You see the way Evan's mom was looking at you?
I'm sorry.

## Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
Yeah, you do that, Lenny.

## Could I speak to you for just a moment, please?
How did you get in here? You're under age.

## No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?
No.

## Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?
He did. Captain Renault did.

## I thought so. Where's your husband?
At the roulette table, trying to win enough for our exit visa. Well of course, he's losing.

## How long have you been married?
So you decided to go to America.

## Does he know that?
Oh, yes.

## And he is still willing to give you a visa?
He always has.

## You want my advice?
Oh, yes, please.

## Well?
You will find a market there for this ring. I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.

## What is your name?
Berger, Norwegian, and at your service, sir.

## Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
I'm sorry. It is.

## Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?
Yes, Monsieur.

## Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee?
No thanks, Carl.

## How long can I afford to stay closed?
Oh, two weeks, maybe three.

## Hello, Rick.
Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?

## Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?
Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.

## What do you want for Sam?
I don't buy or sell human beings.

## My dear Rick, when will you realize that in this world today isolationism is no longer a practical policy?
I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.

## And the carrying charges?
Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters.

## Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?
It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.

## Well, good luck. But be careful. You know you're being shadowed?
Yes, something.

## Do you know where they are?
Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.

## Rick?
He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.

## And Mademoiselle?
You needn't be concerned about me.

## Occupied France?
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.

## What are they?
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.

## And the other alternative?
My dear Mademoiselle, perhaps you have already observed that in Casablanca, human life is cheap. Good night, Mademoiselle.

## And I was wondering.
Who are you really? And what were you before? What did you do and what did you think? Huh?

## Yes?
Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.

## Why there is no other man in my life?
Uh huh.

## Ten years ago? Let's see... ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?
Looking for a job.

## Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?
Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.

## All right. At a quarter to five. Say, why don't we get married in Marseilles?
That's too far ahead to plan.

## Well, why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that... Hey, hey, what's wrong, kid?
Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.

## Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
I didn't count the days.

## Has it got a wow finish?
I don't know the finish yet.

## Why did you come back? To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station?
Yes.

## How did you get in?
The stairs from the street.

## I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won't you sit down?
Richard, I had to see you.

## Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.

## Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.

## And Laszlo?
Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.

## Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving with him. Haven't you told him?
No, not yet.

## But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
Because you're getting on that plane.

## I don't understand. What about you?
No.

## But what about us?
We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.

## Where is Rick?
I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.

## When will he be back?
Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.

## Does he always leave so early?
Oh, he never... well... he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time.

## Won't you join us?
This time they really mean to stop me.

## We have been in difficult places before, haven't we?
I must find out what Berger knows.

## But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?
Yes, I would.

## He does. Could we have a table close to him?
And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.

## What happened with Rick?
We'll discuss it later.

## Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?
Apparently he has the letters.

## Yes?
But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.

## Did he give any reason?
He suggested I ask you.

## Ask me?
Yes, Victor, I was.

## I know how it is to be lonely. Is there anything you wish to tell me?
No, Victor, there isn't.

## Are you ready Ilsa?
Yes, I'm ready. Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.

## Sam?
Yes.

## -- Is what?
Hello, Rick.

## You're saying this only to make me go.
Oh, you've already met Rick, Mademoiselle?

## How do you do?
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.

## Won't you join us for a drink?
And I congratulate you.

## What for?
Your work.

## Monsieur Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you?
Go ahead.

## Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.

## Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs?
I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.

## I beg your pardon?
I said, ask your wife.

## My wife?
Well, this might come in handy.

## Had a close one, eh?
Yes, rather.

## Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting for?
We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.

## You love her that much?
Apparently you think of me only as the leader of a cause. Well, I am also a human being.

## Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
No. It's all arranged.

## Everything in order?
All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.

## But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?
I understand.

## Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
Yes.

## Yes. What is it you want?
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.

## I am delighted to see you both. Did you have a good night's rest?
I slept very well.

## With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
Thank you.

## Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?
I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.

## Are you quite finished with us?
I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am not gracious, but you see, Major Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian.

## Captain Renault, I am under your authority. Is it your order that we come to your office?
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.

## And that is?
You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.

## You will give us the names?
You won't dare to interfere with me here. This is still unoccupied France. Any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault.

## By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
Realizing the importance of the case, my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects.

## How do you do, Mr. Rick?
Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.

## Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on?
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.

## A leader, like Laszlo?
Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.

## What is the meaning of that phone call?
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.

## Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?
Ask Monsieur Rick.

## You know, I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne, maybe get her on the rebound, eh?
When it comes to women, you're a true democrat.

## Why? What's in Lisbon?
The clipper to America.

## And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.

## What, again?
This is no ordinary arrest. A murderer, no less.

## Yeah? Have a brandy?
I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.

## Yeah? What's his name?
Victor Laszlo.

## Victor Laszlo?
Rick, that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed.

## Manages what?
His escape.

## Is that a serious offer?
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.

## Why two?
He is traveling with a lady.

## Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
Because, my dear Ricky, I suspect that under that cynical shell you're at heart a sentimentalist.

## Yeah, you were saying?
Excuse me.

## Oh, how do you do?
And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.

## Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.

## Huh?
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.

## Why do you interfere with my little romances?
Well, they're all excellent reasons.

## Huh?
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.

## What friend?
Ilsa Lund. That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.

## I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.

## Is everything ready?
I have the letters right here.

## Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
Sam's piano.

## Have you taken leave of your senses?
I have. Sit down over there.

## I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this means?
I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.

## You think of everything, don't you?
And the names are Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.

## Our expenses?
Uh huh.

## Where were you last night?
That's so long ago, I don't remember.

## Will I see you tonight?
I never make plans that far ahead.

## What is your nationality?
I'm a drunkard.

## Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
It's not particularly my beloved Paris.

## Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
I haven't the slightest idea.

## Are my eyes really brown?
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.

## In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?
Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.

## Huh. You know, Rick, watching you just now with the Deutsches Bank, one would think you'd been doing this all your life.
Hello?

## May I? Too bad about those two German couriers, wasn't it?
They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.

## Thank you. Will you have a drink with me please?
No.

## I forgot. You never drink with... I'll have another, please. You despise me, don't you?
If I gave you any thought, I probably would.

## But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.

## Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
Myself. I found myself much more reasonable.

## For how long?
Not right now.

## Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?
No.

## You ever going to bed?
No.

## Shut up and go home, will you?
No, sir. I'm staying right here.

## Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?
Uh, my watch stopped.

## What's that you're playing?
Just a little something of my own.

## This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it, Mr. Richard?
You said it! Here's looking at you, kid.

## Where is she? Have you seen her?
No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.

## So how are we going to get this place shaped up?
It's bad.

## If they can't see you, what's the point?
Survive today, that's the point.

## What are you doing?
Can't kill another one. Can't. Can't kill my friends anymore.

## Why do they have to die for me?
They'd eat you if they could. They're laughing at you. Listen.

## Yeah, sure, what?
You know, Wilson, every now and then we should say thank you. Thank you God.

## What's so damn funny?
You are.

## Let's get a second opinion. Wilson? What do you see?
What did it matter if FedEx was five minutes late one day? The next day we just start over again.

## You know what happened to this?
As much as anybody.

## Possible. So you did those wings?
Yeah. A long time ago.

## You are. Yes you are. What gave you the idea to paint on that cave?
To tell you the truth -- you did.

## Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
No. that was the last one.

## Did you really steal a crippled kid's bicycle to make your deliveries, or is that just some bullshit story?
I didn't steal it, and he wasn't crippled.

## What brings you out to the sticks?
Had a package to deliver.

## You? Personally?
I had it on the island with me.

## Your eyes are puffy. Did you take Valium again?
You smell like formaldehyde.

## How was Russia?
Cold.

## Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that. Did you get it fixed?
I thought I did.

## Chuck, forget the Xerox. So Russia didn't turn out well?
Chuck.

## Let me guess, Russia came up?
Hey, look at you.

## For when I travel?
I have to go. I'm on call for overflow down at the Hub.

## You did?
Look, I love the puppy. I love you. But I have to go.

## Could you watch Jango?
No.

## Get back? From where?
Malaysia. They're holding the sweep.

## A week, max. Okay? Okay?
Go on. We'll be fine. I'll feed Jango to the frogs.

## You have any children?
Her name's Hannah.

## What's that?
All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me.

## What's that, written on the sail?
My epitaph.

## There was a coffin?
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.

## What was inside?
Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.

## Yeah?
The tide came in, the tide went out. I survived. That's the headline. I survived.

## You okay?
Great. Really.

## What will you do?
I don't know. I really don't know.

## When's the next Jumbo?
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.

## Anything else?
There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an hour, goes through Sydney.

## Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
Dehydration. Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency. Any or all of the above.

## You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
Not to mention on me.

## Need some help?
You bet I do. High tide comes right up to this road.

## You're not out of Pascagoula, are you?
No.

## But chickens?
True enough. No sacred chickens nowhere, so far as I know.

## Really?
Come on down to the plant. It's state of the art. We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.

## What happened to your pants?
Mom, meet Jango.

## Look, I help take care of the place. You got my check, didn't you Mom?
That new roof, that's your doing.

## I wanted to come here.
When'd you start working here?

## I've got all this back pay coming. Why don't you let me get you a place in town?
This is my home. I'm part of the wallpaper.

## What about the sender?
Sure. Bettina Peterson. Marfa, Texas. Let's run a current check.

## Can you find her?
You're looking at a Level III search. For your Level III, you gotta have E-4 authorization. I don't have it.

## Who is this? Where is Kamal?
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.

## What's going on down there?
Kamal is not here. We are very defused.

## What do you expect, from the guy who stole a kid's bicycle when his truck broke down?
Borrowed. I borrowed it.

## How'd it go?
Great. Terrific. The good guys won one for a change.

## You what?
It was fifteen minutes late.

## What? Let Paris hold its plane? Let Memphis take care of it? Let somebody down the line clean up your mess?
Every person counts, every package counts, that's my point.

## Talk is cheap. Are we on or not?
We're on.

## Hello?
Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland...

## Want to see my raft?
This stinks really bad.

## You were how long on this?
Forty-three days.

## What?
That's what it's about.

## What, then?
Deliver this package. Then, I dunno.

## San Francisco. And you?
As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.

## Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of \"seeing the world,\" isn't it?
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.

## I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again?
Dr. Homer Wells.

## Why not?
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.

## What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.

## What'd she die of?
She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*...

## What are you going to tell the little ones?
I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.

## Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.

## Shouldn't we tell Homer?
If Homer wanted to know what was happening here, he could pick up a telephone and call us.

## How about him not needin' the friggin' compass! How about that?
Daddy, *please*...

## How many months are you?
Two.

## Is your family in the apple business, too?
No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.

## Really?
I've never seen the ocean, either.

## So. Not bored yet?
I'm *never* bored! It's all very... different for me... here.

## Uh... have you been *feeling* okay?
You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then.

## A movie *outside*?
Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.

## When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
Yes! I've only seen one, though.

## You've seen only one movie? Which one?
\"King Kong\". It's really good.

## And what did she die of, exactly?
Yes... and no. When you come here, you don't really care about the movie.

## What are you so crazy about the movies for?
At least you were never lonely.

## You don't miss it?
I miss things. I miss... people. I miss reading to the boys.

## Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?
Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.

## Ah-ha. So what is that--a radio?
The *speaker*. For the movie sound.

## How could you not *care* about the movie?
You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.

## Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet?
I *know* this was right.

## Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?
It will be okay.

## What* will be okay?
We have to wait and see. I think that, for *everything* in life, you have to wait and see.

## So we should \"wait and see.\" For how long?
I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.

## It's a good thing I didn't have that baby, isn't it?
We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there...

## Nothing.
Mr. Rose *knows*?

## Isn't that like waiting and seeing?
No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too.

## What do you want me to *do*?
Please don't make me say it again.

## How is that Wally doing?
Oh, he's fine! I just heard from him. He's bombing all these places...

## You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy?
No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...

## So many children. Are they all orphans?
He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.

## Homer* liked it! Didn't you?
I thought they might take me.

## Nobody's asked for me, have they?
Nobody special enough, Curly.

## You mean somebody asked?
Only the right people can have you, Curly.

## How old are you, dear? Thirteen?
That's a heavy sedation.

## So here is my candidate. What do you think?
But what about school records? Homer doesn't have any *diplomas*...

## Is *your* father dead?
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.

## Liver* killed him?
Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.

## But did you know him?
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.

## Did you know your mother better?
She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.

## What's a nanny do?
She looks after other people's children.

## Did you grow up around here?
No. She was an immigrant.

## What's an immigrant?
Someone not from Maine.

## Homer... doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*?
Uh... it's the end of October.

## Is that soon?
Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.

## Did you bite it?
I don't remember.

## What kind of plane are you flying?
A B-24 Liberator.

## Have you enlisted?
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.

## Really! Is it serious?
No, it's not serious. I'm just not supposed to get excited. You know-- no strain, no stress. I try to keep calm all the time.

## Has anyone offered you anything to eat?
Actually, someone did. I just didn't think I could eat anything.

## Where are you going?
We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.

## You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
No, I'm not. I need a job.

## At what altitude?
I've got thirty-five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet--that's the first mountain pass.

## Migrants?
It's almost like flying.

## What about the trees?
The trees are flak--antiaircraft fire from those geeks on the ground.

## So. What should I do now?
Out back, there's a shed. It's just a mess. If that shed was better organized, I could put my truck in there.

## It's big enough to keep you out of the war, I suppose. Ain't that right?
Right.

## You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
Go on, cut my clothes. I've got other clothes.

## What business is you in, Homer?
Mr. Rose, I'm in the *doctor* business. If you want, I can help you. You don't have to go anywhere.

## There ain't no *almost* about this stuff, Homer--ain't that right?
Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze--lots of gauze.

## When it comes to this, you is the real thing--is that what you sayin'?
I'm stayin', Homer.

## Where'd she get you?
There's more than one laceration, more than one cut.

## First pregnancy?
Yes, for both.

## You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?
One, it's illegal. Two, I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.

## I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.
There was no visible wound?

## Where's the name sheet?
Nobody's named this one yet.

## Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
I don't think so.

## How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.

## Good-bye, Arthur. Homer, I'll see you tomorrow?
Right.

## How long's this been going on, Muddy?
It's just my heart.

## What you got a picture of your heart for?
There's a little something wrong with it. Just this part here--the right ventricle. It's slightly enlarged.

## So what?
Yes, so what. It's nothing serious, really. Just a small defect.

## Do you like to read?
I can't read. Nobody taught me.

## Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
Almost.

## You okay, Rose?
I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...

## I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.

## That's *it*?
Now, now. He's a good boy.

## Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- I didn't think you'd be interested.
Do you know him?

## Then it's malaria?
It's encephalitis B. He's recovering at Mount Lavinia Hospital, Ceylon. Uh... Captain Worthington is paralyzed. Waist down. He won't walk.

## When will he be home, Major?
Mind your own business, Peaches.

## What have you two been doin' to make it look so nice?
Where's your manners? Make room for Homer, so's he can enjoy the view.

## What* view?
Well, Muddy, we can look at all these angry stars Homer's been readin' to us about.

## She's *good* with that knife! She's real fast. She's a lot better with that knife than *you* is, Muddy! And who do you suppose taught her?
You* taught her, I suppose...

## That's right! A girl's gotta know how to defend herself, don't she?
That what happen--you lost you only daughter so's you killed yourself! That's what we say, all right.

## That's right. I know you understand how I feel, Homer--you is breakin' them rules, too. Ain't that right?
Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night.

## What's lucky about that?
You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...

## Thanks for playing along. I just have to sit for a while.
You ever see a palm tree, Homer?

## Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?
Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks.

## Silicon Valley?
Can --

## What do you do over at your bank, Grant?
What do I do? I'm the VP of Finance.

## Listen, what I'm about to tell you, I'm telling you in confidence, okay? Have you ever heard of a company called Big.Com?
Big.Com. That Internet thing.

## And you have this letter of intent?
Yes. That's why I wish there were guys willing to take a chance and live a little.

## What's this?
You need some convincing. Consider it a convincer.

## Ten percent. Of how much?
Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.

## I'm gonna go get eggrolls. Anyone want eggrolls?
It can erase all those things about you that you wish didn't exist.

## The Anti-Christ?
No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy looking for some answers.

## Your life flashing before your eyes?
Just the last three weeks.

## Isn't it always?
I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley.

## And these cops? What do they get?
Keeping the Fix happy.

## So how'd you get caught?
Suits used to say that in any con, sooner or later someone's going to start asking the right questions. Usually, it takes a little longer.

## Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match?
You're a superstitious fucker.

## Like what?
She had you tempting fate.

## Is that what it was, Jake? Was it love?
You know when the first con was ever played? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden.

## Alrlght, alrlght. What happened today?
Today? Started off great...

## Alright... Turn around. She doesn't get shit, unless I get that money. Where is it?
Probably safe in the hands of the Federal Government.

## Oh, Jake. You disappoint me. And you just let Lily here down again. What was it you said about playing the big con?
It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark.

## Not that I recall. What do you want us to do about it?
So we go to the bar.

## And how much did you say you wanted for this... What did you call it? A finder's fee?
Ten is standard, sir.

## What's a King Pin?
Currently, the King Pin is a very large-type pole stuck up our asses.

## Mob?
Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.

## Big Al gets whacked mid-egg foo young. The whole thing took about two and a half hours. That's how good he is.
You're pissed we didn't get credit?

## We sure Big Al threw him to us?
Come on...

## We're going to give him the money back?
Fuck that. We're going too.

## Alright, let's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second. Is this the best thing to do?
This might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard.

## I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?
Masters of our own destiny.

## So far, masters of our own demise. What bank are you with?
Moonan. Here. Shit...

## I guess. I gotta drop a dime. Did anybody mess up the hoop?
It can buy you a new and better you.

## I just don't know if this says, \"me\". What's the fabric?
Seems Lionel Dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night. They just pulled him out of the East River.

## And what about Big Al?
Leave him. Someone's going to find him eventually. Then they'll start looking for us, too.

## When?
Tonight. Just me.

## How much we going after?
Two million.

## She up for this?
She's up for it.

## You sure?
We're going to make it back, Grant. Three or four times over.

## You'll be there?
Eight A.M. flight.

## Calls?
We'll use the Euc.

## Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.
You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy?

## Why not?
Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.

## Let me repeat -- Why not?
Because you killed one of my crew.

## Why?
You ask a lot of questions. Come on. Let me see 'em.

## How much?
I think two million.

## Stake you?
I need you to stake me. I can't do it without it. It's just a couple hundred grand. Taken out of our cut when we're done.

## That's more than you already owe me. What happens if you fuck this up?
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

## Listen, Scooter --
Hey Skippy? Do I have the word \"chump\" tattooed on my forehead?

## Excuse me?
I said take off your fucking shirt.

## You're not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything, are you?
Come here. Feel this.

## That tip not work-out for you fellas?
Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.

## Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.

## Kennedy. International terminal. Gordo with a black suitcase. You got Moonan under control?
Don't worry about Moonan. We got him covered. When...? It was him. There's a shipment coming through tonight. Kennedy.

## Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
Great. Thank you.

## What brings you down from Boston, Jake? Taking advantage of the long weekend?
My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.

## Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it?
Very much so.

## Says who?
We have work. It pays a lot. Unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up.

## Oooh. Sassy. What do you care who feels me up, Jake? Unless it kinda gotcha going. Did it, Jake? Getcha going?
Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job.

## No. What's my cut?
You get an equal cut.

## What do I have to do?
Just play a part. A little acting.

## What about Customs?
I'll worry about Customs.

## What the hell's his problem?
Don't worry about it.

## It's just that I left my asshole decoder ring at home, so how do I know not to worry?
You need to get a haircut.

## What?
And some new clothes.

## Why?
You're just going to have to trust me.

## Uh... Everything okay?
We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now. If they beat us to it...

## For what? A couple hundred bucks?
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.

## Do you have something to prove?
Not in that repressed anger sort of way.

## Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.

## So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.

## How do you know I will?
Sounds respectable.

## You want to talk about an old boyfriend right now?
Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.

## Did, uh... Did you kill him?
No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.

## Everyone's working an angle, right?
What about...

## You got my cell. Leave a message.
What about what?

## What do you get, Lily? Finder's Fee? Because it is all about the money, right?
You sold me out. You should have trusted me like I trusted you. You fucked up. You fucked up HUGE.

## Stop waving that thing around.
What do you want? An apology?

## You sure we're clear?
Yeah.

## How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
I'm getting a ride.

## You better hurry. The police will be here any second. I don't really understand my motivation with this. Why am I washing glasses?
We're working for the King.

## Wait a second... Who's the mope?
No. Big con. One rag. One rag and we get out from under all this. But we need another Shill.

## What do we need another Shill for?
Breasts.

## Why?
Because that's who the King Pin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect...

## I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?
Good point.

## Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
We never had a problem with that before.

## Is it all fugasi?
No, the corporate papers have to be legit. But you gotta score an I.D. A clean one. Talk to Suits. I gotta get us a Banker.

## You sure?
But if you wanna talk about bad luck...

## What do we do? We change the scam?
Feeling lucky today, Miles. Found a penny -- Heads up. There was an empty cab right outside my building. We hit every green light.

## Jake? Customs?
Excuse me? I believe you're holding something far me under Pearson.

## Do you have a ticket?
You know, this is kind of embarrassing, but my wallet was stolen yesterday and I'm afraid the ticket was in it. But the name's Pearson.

## What was it?
A ring for my wife. A lot like that one. In fact, it was that one.

## Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?
With identification.

## I understand that, but I had my wallet stolen last night. Is there any way..?
I'm sorry.

## You going to have the time?
I'll find the time.

## What'd he say?
Oh, you know... Don't fuck this up. I'll kill you. I'll kill your family. I'll shoot your dog... All the usual. Then he said good luck.

## He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this?
Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.

## What's up with you? Bladder infection?
Keep it up.

## What?
Stand up.

## Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse. You into something big?
Pretty much.

## In over your head?
Pretty much.

## Can I speak to you in confidence?
Huh? Oh. She's alright.

## Then who's the Banker?
The King.

## I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?
It's not history.

## So what do you want?
I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.

## We got a good thing going here. You want to blow it over an overbite?
The King, huh? Nice going.

## What?
Consider him part of your crew. Consider him a part of me.

## A Fed? Is he close?
I don't think so. Their Fix gave us the heads up and Jake's got a plan that'll probably keep him off.

## So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?
I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.

## Special Agent?
You are Officer Richard Rottovich. And this would be Officer Walter Sobozinski. I'm looking for Jake Vig.

## If you Feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now?
I want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act.

## I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
Let's just say he burned me once.

## You guys awake?
We're here.

## What do you get out of it?
Peace of mind.

## That's it?
Not everyone's on the take, Walter.

## Good... I gotta go. So, what do you have for me?
Whaddya mean? We got dick.

## To who?
You think this is a good idea? We never did this kinda shit before.

## You trust this Moonan guy?
High five.

## Jack. Do you need a ride?
No. Thanks.

## Why did you quit?
I got scared.

## Ah, we all say that. But if we hate it, why do we do it?
The Indian rope-trick.

## What are you talking about?
Reynolds got a doctor in. They forced me to take a dope test. It was positive. As you knew.

## What are you laughing at? Who was that on the phone?
A couple I know are getting married.

## What's the Blue Book price?
That's not relevant. An old car like this, it depends on the condition.

## How about fifteen hundred?
How about five hundred.

## Is that your idea of arithmetic?
I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.

## What a memory you've got. Maths always was your strong suit. What happened to the moaning Lisa?
She went back to South Africa.

## Right. Look, I must get back to Habib.
All right. As what?

## Habib?
My author. He's a Terrorist. He's written a kill-and-tell book. Take care.

## Who was he?
She.

## Get what? Are you accusing me of cheating?
Good God, no. But with skill like that, what do you want a job for? You don't need to work.

## Good night?
Not particularly.

## And your lady?
She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you.

## A bit unexpected, wasn't it?
Not entirely.

## How's that football story corning along?
You said it was going to be social, Giles. No business.

## You want me drunk?
I won't be that long.

## It's not just inner beauty, is it?
Turn around.

## Where did you get it?
I. sold the car.

## What job?
In a casino. As a croupier. A dealer.

## How did you land that?
It came my way. 450 a week.

## 450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
I had training. In the Republic.

## Are you trying to read my palm?
You've got such beautiful hands.

## What's the time?
I don't know.

## How did it go?
Fine.

## You're shaking. What is it?
Tension. It'll go.

## Are you drunk?
Probably.

## Do you have to swear all the time?
Marion, stop this.

## Haven't you got a conscience of your own?
What are you doing here? You know the rules.

## What about a drink on the way home?
I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.

## Well, that's our life now, isn't it?
I don't like it.

## Why not?
I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.

## What?
You were talking in your sleep.

## Never. Why do you ask?
I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...

## Really?
Gambling's about not facing reality. Ignoring the odds.

## How did you know I was here?
I thought you wouldn't want to spend Christmas Day alone in here.

## There was a message, wasn't there?
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.

## Marion! What did you tell the police?
Nothing about you.

## Then what?
Give up being a croupier, Jack. Or I'll shop you. All you have to do is keep your word. It's that simple.

## Why did you take the money?
I hate public transport.

## What?
I want to buy a car.

## How can anyone be that naive?
Great.

## Found a job?
No.

## I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept gratuities in the UK. It's different in South Africa.
So how are you doing, dad?

## You know where I'm from?
I've lived there.

## That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
Impossible to calculate.

## So why did you come to my casino?
I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.

## Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.
First visit to London?

## Your father?
I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.

## That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there?
We all came from Africa, supposedly.

## Do you believe in astrology?
Absolutely not. But then, I'm a Gemini and Geminis don't believe in astrology.

## How did you hurt your hand?
Just an accident. Nothing.

## Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
You don't like cheats, do you.

## Which side do you like?
You choose.

## What kind of trouble?
I owe a lot of money.

## Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
Who's they?

## Robbery's not criminal?
You're serious.

## What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
It won't.

## What ten thousand pounds?
Reynolds? You've done your research.

## What about my neck?
I want to go back to Cape Town, I want to start again, clean.

## How much do you owe?
Let it go.

## Did they tell you to sleep with me?
I told you, all bets are off.

## What for?
I have to take the car.

## Is it yes?
Yes.

## Do you?
Yes.

## Would you like a drink?
No thank you.

## Jani! Where are you?
Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.

## How are you?
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.

## Did you solve your problems?
I know a cheat when I see one. The man was a cheat.

## Have I?
I'm Lucy.

## Are you going to put a spell on me?
I might.

## Nice car. How much did you pay for it?
Too much. Eighteen hundred.

## Where to?
Turn left at the lights.

## Where do you live, Jack?
Over the river.

## Have you got transport?
I'm going over the river. I'll give you a lift if you like.

## How long have you worked at the casino?
Coming up to two years now. But I was away for six months.

## What the fuck are you talking about?
That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.

## What are you, a cop?
If I see you do it again, I'll report it.

## I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that.

## Who are these guys?
Mostly people in the casino business. A few drug dealers.

## Just girls. What are you drinking?
Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.

## Does Bella come here?
That bitch? No.

## Rough day?
Rough life, Jack.

## What happened to Bella?
I'll tell you later.

## Has he?
No.

## Where did you go to school?
I was at Beadles.

## Do you have a Salon Prive?
We tried. But there wasn't enough business. The punters like company.

## Why four? And not three or five?
It's the procedure here. Now sort the chips.

## Any exceptions?
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.

## You use two alternating, don't you?
We do.

## Where's the magnet?
They've been tested.

## Haven't you forgotten something?
I don't think so.

## What happens if I want to sneeze?
You won't. Not without permission.

## How many aces are left?
Five.

## What makes you so sure?
It's a rule. Always stand by your first count. The odds are you're right.

## You want me to check?
I said good call.

## What for?
For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters.

## Ever?
I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds.

## Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.

## Girlfriend?
Yes.

## She's not in the gaming business is she?
No.

## Does he win?
He's a good customer.

## How do you feel, Jack?
Bruised.

## What flickering light?
The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero.

## Oh. What's wrong now?
I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.

## Look, bomb...
Remember when the artificial gravity, went out in the toilet?

## What's he doin'?
We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die.

## Doolittle, are you there?
What was that, I didn't hear...

## What the hell?
Yoo hoo, bomb...

## Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?
Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.

## It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
Well, there's the possibility of...

## Why doesn't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us?
Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.

## Talby, can you read me?
Energy shielding positive function.

## Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.

## Fail safe in lock. Four minutes to drop, 22 minutes to detonation. This is Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb 20. Do you read me, bomb?
Bomb 20 to Sergeant Pinback. Roger, I read you, continue.

## One hundred twenty seconds to drop, bomb, have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
Energy shielding positive function.

## Do you remember the detonation time?
Detonation in twenty minutes.

## You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?
No.

## Huh?
Therefore, I shall ignore you.

## Bomb?
Snap out of it, bomb.

## Hello, bomb, are you with me?
Of course.

## Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
I am always receptive to suggestions.

## Fine. Think about this one, then, how do you know you exist?
Well of course I exist.

## But how do you know you exist?
It is intuitively obvious.

## Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?
Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.

## That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.

## All right now, here's the big question, how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct?
In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.

## Why don't you have more time?
Because I must detonate in seventy- five seconds.

## Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully. What is your one purpose in life?
To explode, of course.

## And you can only do it once, right?
That is correct.

## And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?
Of course not.

## Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?
Mafhkin oble groop...

## Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom. I need a last-minute diameter approximation.

## Boiler, can you set me up with some temp figures?
New star. Hey, guess what? I got a new star on the readout.

## Which one?
Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.

## Any planets?
Yeah. Eight, it says here.

## Any of 'em any good?
Naah. All stable.

## The new star. What are you gonna name it?
Who cares. Don't bother me.

## Wha?
I hereby name this star Fred.

## Out where?
Veil nebula.

## Who cares?
Oh, sure.

## Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
I need a diameter approximation.

## You know what I think about, Talby?
I'm getting something here, on this readout...

## Yes, Talby, what is it?
Sounds good, Talby. Let me know if anything important comes up.

## Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.

## Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?
Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.

## Guess you're right.
What happened, Doolittle?

## Phoenix?
It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix! They glow with all the colors of the rainbow, just like everybody said.

## No kidding?
I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...

## Yeah?
I really liked you too, Talby. Hey, some debris from the ship! It's coming right by me.

## Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.

## Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me? Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch?
Yes sir. Negative effect.

## What was that, Doolittle?
Negative effect.

## It didn't work?
Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.

## Commander? Are you still there?
Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.

## Sir?
Talk to the bomb.

## Sir?
Phenomenology...

## Men... men... what happened, men?
Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.

## Who are you?
Bruno's girlfriend.

## Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

## No?
No... Cause tonight the girls are here in a more or less professional capacity. All of them work for me, and you don't... Let's go.

## How I make my living, what's your point?
This.

## Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
Yeah?

## What?
That's not why we're here.

## What're you talkin' about?
That's a lotta crap.

## How come I never hearda you before?
I'm outta Portland. Sonrisa didn't want local talent.

## Who's Camille?
None of your business.

## You know each other?
Nothing happened between me and Tia.

## Can I say something in my defense?
No.

## Where?
How're ya doin', Max.

## Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend? Who would take offense to that?
Justine was not an unwilling participant.

## Do you know why I went after Justine?
She was there...

## Why would I be pissed?
It was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued, causing you to maybe take offense.

## What are you doing here?
I live here... Guess I don't have to ask what you're doing here.

## What is it?
Police drone.

## What? Where're we going?
Lemme put some clothes on.

## Nobody there to sign for it, mon. What's a bruddah s'posed to do, ride around all day with the damn package?
So you just decided to return it to the sender. Or, in this case, the sender's wife.

## Where'd you clip this?
I didn't. It was a present from a guy.

## What're you looking for?
A grand.

## So Max, what do you do with all your money?
They took my daughter.

## Can you help me get her back?
Look, I'd really like to...

## If I give myself up in exchange for Sophy, would you make sure she's okay?
We're not going that route. Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.

## What else can we do?
Because we can't. There's nothing here for us anymore.

## Are we in some kind of trouble?
No...

## What makes you cry?
If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.

## Mommy, where are you?
Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.

## When?
Soon, baby.

## You're a thief?
Girl's gotta make a living.

## So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?
No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.

## Can we go somewhere and talk?
Lemme get my coat.

## How'd you find me?
Wasn't that hard.

## Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
Now you know who I am, where I live. I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.

## So now you tracked me down. What d'ya think?
Too early to tell.

## How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
Lauren's not my wife.

## Girlfriend?
One of my sources. Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.

## So what are you gonna do about it?
Something.

## Is the social studies class over for today?
Yeah...

## Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time?
I won't be staying.

## Bent?
Bent.

## How do I know you didn't?
So saw my hands off, I left you a present.

## Am I s'posed to be grateful?
That would be appropriate, yes.

## How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?
You're that nervous, you're welcome to stay here.

## Expensive gifts, surprise late-night visits, over-the-top flattery... You always come on this strong?
Only when I meet someone I have to know everything about.

## The other ones?
The other one like you...

## Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
The bar code on your neck, Max. I know who you are and I know who you're running from.

## How much do you know?
I know they made me. Even got the label on my neck to prove it.

## What's in it for you?
Your help.

## She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers. You know who Sonrisa is?
Yeah, I catch your hacks. He's Satan's lap dog, or something.

## I would've come sooner, but...I didn't... How're you doin'?
Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.

## You believe that?
Well, not me personally.

## What's this?
Open it.

## Know where I can find her?
You don't want to.

## But she does work here?
She may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me. Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme.

## Any idea when she'll be back?
None.

## Who is it?
A friend of your fiance's.

## What do you want?
To set the record straight about where he was the other night when he said he was working late.

## Who are you?
My name's Lydia. And it seems you and I have a lot in common.

## How do I know you're telling the truth?
Look, I don't know what you want--

## Oh?
Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.

## My name's not kid. It's client. As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle. Now, you got something for me or not?
Right here someplace.

## Nothing on Hannah?
Only a last name would be nice. Or the nearest town to this...clinic.

## Whoever tossed this place wants you. And I'm looking to stay outta the line of fire.
What about the other kids? You get anything on them?

## How's this about me?
Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations.

## Hardware's too sophisticated. It's gotta be the government. And why do I think they're looking for you?
You're crazy.

## Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
Just do it... Five-seven-five-oh- eight...

## Got a pencil?
Just give it to me. I'll remember.

## Straight.
No, but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what I'm saying?

## Shame, wastin' a girl like that on a guy, but what're you gonna do?
Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him.

## Tell me the truth. Am I a female fog bank?
You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.

## A little what?
You know what I'm saying.

## How long you and me known each other?
A long time.

## Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.

## Where?
It's a secret.

## Not right now? Okay, when?
Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds.

## What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card list?
Look, you're a player... I'm bringing you this on a plate, and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business.

## And she bought that?
I have sincere eyes.

## Can you put that in a bag or something?
You get it when I get her.

## It's payday, need me to pick up your check?
You're the best, Maxie.

## Playing hooky again?
Feel like the dog's dinner.

## What if he's on the level?
Tell everybody hey.

## Quitting time. Grab a cold one?
I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.

## What's up?
You blew off your girlfriend last night, even though it was the big one-oh. I'd be pissed off too if I was her.

## I'm the victim here.
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?

## Then a sympathetic mouth, then a sympathetic--
Really?

## Does this person have a name?
Lydia.

## And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
I'm a toy to her.

## A toy?
She's as much as said so. But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her.

## What happens if you level with her?
Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again.

## And why should she?
So you're straight on how this is gonna go down.

## How'd you get her out of town?
Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.

## And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
I'll give it my best shot.

## Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?
You don't.

## What about this?
I'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause I'm not feeling so hot.

## Huh?
I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.

## What the hell is that?
Gin.

## Who's Whiskey Dick?
Well. Obviously no one you have to worry about... Woody.

## You love him?
I just told you, he's a big, hairy...

## No, I mean... you love your son?
More than anything in the world.

## And he loves you back, doesn't he?
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.

## You're a little scrawny, but thanks to the concert we're low on amateurs. Name?
Hawk.

## You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
Yeah, a man's drink...

## You mean you never seen a Jack Daniels on the rocks before?
Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all.

## Yeah?
I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia.

## Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?
I have all your notebook doodles memorized, Jam... Here.

## Ann Arbor isn't... that far from Cleveland, right?
Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.

## That'd be great. Hey, maybe someday your band'll play there. It's a college town, you know?
I feel like such an idiot. Why didn't I just say something a year and a half ago? Man, think of how much time we wasted.

## You got in the car, didn't you?
Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere.

## What are you, high?
Yeah.

## Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?
Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.

## Namely?
Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.

## What's in Sandusky?
Pizza, and I been jones-in' for a pizza ever since we left St. Bernard's.

## What was that D.J.'s name again?
Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar...

## Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think?
Brilliance, Trip. Sheer brilliance. Give Albert Einstein here the Nobel Prize.

## Any luck?
We are not stealing my mom's car.

## And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?
Sunday, but...

## Now, how are we gonna do this?
Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.

## No... You don't think...?
Nah. Couldn't be.

## Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?
Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.

## How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?
Sure.

## Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
The easy way.

## Hawk?
Just listen up, man, cause we are in a quandary.

## Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?
They're still at my house in Trip's jacket.

## They're what?
She was standing right over me when I was changing for fuck's sake.

## If he offers you a slice, you're not the least bit hungry, check?
Check.

## What?! Are you mentally deranged, Jam?
Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice.

## Jeremiah, what are you doing?
Uhh... nothing.

## Change? What's wrong with what I got on?
But, mom!

## Grounded for the rest of the year?
You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome.

## I said, I'm sorry!
You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?

## Mom, what're we...?
Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah.

## Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my first confession in... well... a really long time.
Jeremiah... what's gotten into you?

## Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession?
Just one, Father, but boy was it a doozy.

## That's it?
Yeah.

## Was it a teddy?
No. Much bet... I mean, much more sinful than that.

## A bustier?
Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.

## What?
Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big ass.

## Let's lift up her shirt.
That's some sick shit right there. Did she comb your ass hair for you too?

## Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change?
Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. I just made an honest mistake.

## Okay, I'm just a little mad now! Jam, why'd you talk us into picking that bitch up in the first place!?
Twenty-five more'n I got.

## What do you want?
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.

## Two hundred bucks?
You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life.

## VOICE Simple Simon on the Rock, go caller.
COAT Oh, yeah! You and what army?

## VOICE Is that your final answer?
Yeah.

## Hi... what's going on here?
Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.

## What happened?
He got smooshed. By a jet engine.

## What was his name?
Donnie. Donnie Darko.

## Dr. Monnitoff?
Donnie.

## I know that this is gonna sound kinda weird... but do you know anything about time travel?
So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time.

## So... that's it?
Like a DeLorean.

## What effect do you think this would have on an infant?
Did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness? That darkness is part of their natural development.

## Could these wormholes appear in nature?
That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.

## If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?
Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...

## When can I squeeze one out?
Not until like... eighth grade.

## What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha?
I didn't say shit.

## What did you say?
Our saviour...

## How can you do that?
I can do anything I want... and so can you...

## Why did you make me flood the school?
We just want to guide you in the right direction.

## Who is... we?
You'll know soon enough.

## Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?
I want to show you something.

## You have a request?
Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.

## Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
Take it off. I want to see you.

## What happened to your eye?
I am so sorry.

## Why do they call you Frank?
It is the name of my father... and his father before me.

## How much longer is this gonna last?
You should already know that. Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something to show you.

## My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
I don't wanna talk about it.

## How old is Grandma Death?
A hundred and one, I think. Every day she does the same thing. But there's never any mail.

## Wanna walk me home?
Sure.

## So... you just moved here?
Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad. He has... emotional problems.

## Oh, I... have those too. What kind of problems does your dad have?
He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.

## Wow. Did he go to jail?
He fled. They still can't find him. My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.

## What makes you think I'm not?
I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.

## You mean soap?
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.

## Why is that?
We never would have had this conversation.

## Where are we going?
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.

## Where are you going?
I'm going home.

## So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?
No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.

## Why?
Well... maybe someone is, like... giving you these dream steroids. And sleepwalking ...is someone showing you the way.

## With, like, images?
Like... a Hawaiian sunset... the Grand Canyon. Things that remind you how beautiful the world can be.

## And what?
Well...

## What?
They suspended me for two days.

## Who?
The old crazy woman who lives off Old Gun Road.

## Oh, yeah. \"The Philosophy of Time Travel\". What is this?
I know she's here. She never leaves the house.

## What? How long was I asleep?
The whole movie. Let's go.

## Will you please talk to me?
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.

## Hey. You OK?
My mom is gone.

## Where is she?
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.

## Did you call the cops?
Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.

## What?
There's something you have to know, Gretchen. Everything is going to be just fine.

## Where are we going?
Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her.

## Why? Is this about the book?
No. Frank.

## Is that a cellar door?
Yeah...

## Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?
We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.

## I wish I knew where you went at night. Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house?
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom. Get out of my room.

## Then why don't you start taking the goddamn pills?
Grandma Death.

## How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
It feels wonderful.

## So how was school today?
Good Lord. So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.

## So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
You tell Dr. Thurman whatever you want.

## Who's been giving you weird looks?
A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason. But that's OK... because I know I deserve it.

## Who is Frank?
A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.

## Why should we care?
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.

## Where are you going?
I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.

## What's \"Cellar Door\"?
Cellar door.

## So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?
I think I already have. But now she won't even talk to me.

## Would you like to talk about this friend?
His name is Frank.

## Don't you watch the news?
I don't own a television.

## Follow him where?
Into the future. Then he said that the world was coming to an end.

## Do you believe that the world is coming to an end?
No. That's stupid.

## And when I clap my hands twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
Yes.

## What is her name?
Gretchen. We're going together now.

## Do you think a lot about girls?
Yes.

## How are things going at school?
I think about girls a lot.

## Who is the boss?
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.

## Donnie... I want to hear about your friend Frank.
What about your family, Donnie?

## How many times have you seen Frank?
Four times... so far.

## Can anyone else see him?
I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.

## Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.

## How does that make you feel?
It reminded me of my dog Callie.

## Is Callie still around?
No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...

## Do you feel alone right now?
No. That makes you keep searching.

## What did you find?
Nothing.

## Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...

## Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?
Whoa. That's OK, Dr. Thurman, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. I have sexual fantasies all the time too.

## And when I clap my hands together twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
Yes.

## So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
I... I was playing with fire.

## Is it Frank who wants you to destroy the world, to set the world on fire?
People get hurt.

## Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.

## What did you want for Christmas that year?
Hungry Hungry Hippos.

## How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
Regret.

## What else makes you feel regret?
That I did it again.

## You've done it again?
Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.

## If God exists?
I think now that he might...

## Why?
Because I'm so horny.

## Where are we going, Donald?
I have the power to build a time machine.

## How is that possible?
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.

## Then how is time travel possible?
It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.

## When will this happen?
Soon. Time is almost up.

## What is going to happen?
Frank is going to kill.

## Where is he, Donald?
It's too late. I've already ruined my life.

## Guess who wrote it?
So I hear you have a girlfriend.

## Why would I tell Mom?
Because you tell Mom everything.

## Excuse me? What's your name, son?
Gerald.

## Frank?
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.

## You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
He has described lengthy conversations... physical encounters with what I believe to be a manifestation of his subconscious mind.

## I... What can we do?
I would like to put him through more hypnotherapy... and increase his medication.

## He was a year ahead of us?
He died, remember? On the way to the prom. He was doomed.

## Excuse me?
Donnie? You're a dick.

## Did you just call me a fuck-ass?
That's enough.

## I got twelve classrooms full of water. All coming from a busted water main.
No. I took a year off to be with you. Of course I care. Don't get angry. What?

## What else?
What else? Shit, Principal Cole, you ain't gonna believe what else.

## Christ. Is that an axe?
Yep.

## How did this happen?
I guess they made him do it.

## Do you even know who Graham Greene is?
I think we've all seen \"Bonanza\".

## Beg pardon?
But now you can't go.

## What is this shit?
Raspberry.

## Is Mom okay?
She's alive, sweetie.

## So, what do I say?
Oh my God. I'm so dead...

## Really, Loretta?
You-betcha.

## My mom wanted me to have this?
Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.

## What is wrong with you?
I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.

## Really?
No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.

## \"Here,\" wh-wh-what?
My jacket. Take it 'cause, y'know, I got my costume okay'd before the pageant. You can wear it.

## Yah?
Oh-you-beccha.

## Huh?
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.

## Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
That's my mom. I'll get 'em in a sec.

## We all do. Now let's go.
No, wait. It -- it was here before the openin' number... wait. What am I sayin'? I should just ask you, Becky. Where is it?

## Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to me? Why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on?
Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.

## But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
Oh, Amber, like you're the only one who visits Mary.

## You heard me. Where is it?
If you're gettin' at somethin', you better just say it.

## So, anyone talk to Janelle?
Yah -- I brought her some flowers this morning. She's in the room next to my mom. She's super happy.

## Amber, if I die from these fumes, will you be sure to cover the hickies on my neck?
Yeah...

## And the bite marks on my ears?
Yes...

## Are we on \"Cops\" again?
You could be quiet.

## Say, yous boys been to the Leeman's?
Loretta, shut it.

## That's right.
Anyone?

## Okay?
Mm-hm.

## What?
Wisconsin.

## Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?
\"Can I? I'm Amer-I-Can!\" People ask me where I get this. I don't know, it's... maybe a gift from God or somethin'.

## GIRL Tammy Curry?
1 Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.

## Lester?
Oh, all right How soon they forget where all this comes from.

## Hey! Turn that float around. You think a swan's gonna swim ass first up Main Street?
Iris, stop! It's not his fault. The communal wine just proves too temptin' for some of them.

## Okay, I designed the float, you know. And, what's gonna happen here is that this is going to look like a glistening lake beneath the swan.
Oh! What is it?

## I want to have the big bag of little donuts.
Uh, Gladys?

## You get nothing, Hank, okay?
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.

## Who to?
The President of the United States.

## That's not right yet... put back \"President\" and take out \"dear\"... How does it read now?
\"My President\"...

## There's still something wrong with it... take out \"President\" ...now what've you got?
\"My\"...

## Now we're on the right track... Put back \"dear\"... How does it read?
\"My dear\"...

## Is that all?
About - thirty-four seconds.

## Who to?
None of your business... Take another letter.

## Yes -- why?
I wanna powder my nose...

## In her dressing room? Why, what could he be doing there?
He could be playing solitaire, but I don't think so.

## Half watch dog?
Yeh, he's only got one eye.

## I don't know much about dogs but you ought to be on the end of a leash - a ninety-nine year leash - Look - what do you call your dog?
I don't call him, I whistle.

## What do you whistle?
Yankee Poodle.

## I've got just the place for a man like you but I'm too busy right now to do any digging. What do you call your dog when you want him?
I don't want him.

## Oh no, I can't do it.
Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound?

## You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?
Sure. How much does the job pay? Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.

## You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
At's-a no good. I went to Niagara Falls once.

## Did you shoot the rapids?
No, but I shot some ducks.

## Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice -- I've got it -- how would you like to be Secretary of the Interior?
That's no good. I like to work on the outside. I must have something easy.

## Then you don't wanna work hard?
I don't wanna work at all.

## What do I get?
You get half mine and I get half yours.

## Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
Sure, that's easy. You gotta insult somebody.

## Why wasn't I insulted?
You was insulted, but you don't know it.

## Why didn't his niece slap your face?
She did.

## You're lucky I don't slap your face -- you oughtta be ashamed of yourself. Where did you hear that story?
You told it to me.

## Wait a minute. What kind of an army do you think we oughtta have?
I think we oughtta have a standing army, so we can save money on chairs.

## Sure, we gotta have a spy. If we no got a spy who's gonna tell the other side what we're doing?
I'm glad I didn't ask you for \"Washington Crossing the Delaware\".

## We've gotta have somebody who knows how to get secrets from men. You know how to make love?
He's going to make a good spy... that's not bad for the first day.

## Why not? You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?
Yes, but I'm not working for you any more. I'm on the other side.

## Now -- how many men you got in your army?
Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.

## Well, we'll let that one go. Now -- how many battalions you got?
We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.

## I wish you were still working for me, so I could ask you to resign. How're ya fixed for cavalry?
I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.

## Anything else?
Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.

## Fine. We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery. By the way, how're you fixed for spys?
Fine. We gotta him.

## Your Excellency, please don't think me silly, but I'd love to have a picture of you. I want to hang it in my bedroom.
How'm I doing, boss?

## You couldn't hang me in your bedroom -- I'll make a note of it. Where's my secretary?
You keep that up and you'll crab the whole war.

## Oh, Your Excellency, isn't there something I can do?
Yes, but I'll talk to you about that when we're alone...

## Are you getting tired?
Not at all. When I was a boy back on the farm I used to pump my own water.

## Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum... I'll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance.
Are you sure you're not tired?

## Your Excellency, haven't we met before?
What can this mug offer you? Wealth and family. I can't give you wealth... ...but we can have a little family of our own.

## Well, why not say the least and get it over with?
That's what you think.

## Then it's war?
Yes.

## Nothing doing!! I've taken a lease on the battlefield. I'd lose my deposit, besides, I've already ordered the ammunition...
How're ya fixed for ammunition?

## What I called you... Why, what did I call you?
I don't remember.

## Oh -- you mean... worm?
No, that wasn't it...

## Was it -- swine?
No... it was a seven letter word.

## You can keep it -- I've got a whole pack... Now what were you saying?
In choosing you, I feel that I serve my country well. I heartily endorse everything you stand for.

## I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me. Not that I care -- but where is your husband?
Why - er -- my husband passed away... I was with him to the very end.

## Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg...
Your Excellency, you mustn't forget your appointment at the House of Representatives... Have you got your speech ready?

## Oh, your Excellency, you take me off my feet.
He did?... I told my son not to leave it laying around... Where is son?

## Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?
Why -- why -- of course.

## WHAT ?
I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.

## Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
The king can do no wrong!

## Oh, would you...?
For you, I would do anything...

## Mr. Merrick, sugar?
Yes please, two.

## One or two?
Two, please.

## Oh?
And here is one of Frederick's mother.

## You won't be long?
I'll join you shortly.

## Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
No, I think a whiskey.

## And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
I'm sure I don't know, Freddie.

## Do you?
Yes.

## Hmmm?
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.

## Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
That I am very little different from him.

## ...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
Oh Frederick.

## Yes?
I found it.

## Did you see it?
Our man is sick. Come right away.

## What is it?
Like this.

## What do you mean?
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.

## What happened?
He fell. He falls.

## I like doing business with you. You and I understand each other, completely. I know I can trust you. Can't I?
Everything will be seen to.

## Good morning, sir.
Just a moment, how did you get in here?

## You've acquired a taste for this?
No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.

## Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.

## Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?
Yes sir.

## Oh, is he a friend of yours?
No, more of an acquaintance.

## Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?
Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.

## A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...

## Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?
Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.

## And what was that, John?
It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words.

## Tell me, John, how did you know the rest of the 23rd Psalm?
Treves. Well done.

## Can you imagine what his life has been like?
Yes, I think I can.

## Do you think they'll go along with us?
Of course they will. They're reasonable men.

## Has the response picked up?
Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time.

## I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
I feel much better. Thank you.

## Are you comfortable here?
Everyone has been very kind. I am extremely grateful.

## Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview?
...everyone has been very kind.

## What is it, Treves?
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, Thou anointest my head with oil...

## How long has this man been here?
Three quarters of an hour.

## I say Freddie, what are you about?
Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.

## Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there?
You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.

## Nothing of any importance, eh?
You never mentioned his mental state.

## What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.

## Mr. Treves says that you are in the theatre. Do you live there?
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.

## You've never been?
Alas, no.

## Have you read it?
No, but I certainly shall.

## Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.

## Oh no?
Oh no... no... you're a Romeo.

## Is he... dying then?
Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...

## Want to come out?
You're English.

## Of course! You want out?
Yes.

## Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?
Yes.

## It's alright, it was thrown away. No one wants it. It's just that it's a little dirty, that's all.
Where did you get this box?

## What's this?
The main spire.

## The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?
Yes.

## Why, my dear Mrs. Mothershead, how good of you to join us. Mr. Merrick, will you please introduce yourself?
Hello, my name is John Merrick.

## Mr. Merrick likes the food here. Don't you John?
Oh yes! It is much better than what I am used to.

## Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't you tell me you could read?
You did not ask me.

## Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
Very well, thank you. I have something for you, John. I'm sure you'll enjoy it, it's very popular.

## This... is my new home?
Yes.

## How long will I stay here?
You look splendid, John.

## John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset?
I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.

## Well, it's a lovely bedroom. What do you call that thing above the bed?
That's a canopy, John.

## How is your tea, John?
Not at all, John.

## I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses?
Oh yes.

## Who are they of?
Oh, our relatives... the children.

## The children! May I see?
Of course.

## Your mother?
Here.

## John, there's someone here who would like to meet you. Would that be alright?
Never, oh! Never, nothing will die. the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats Nothing will die.

## ...my... home?
Yes, John.

## You did this for me?
Yes.

## Is it the one you wanted?
Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.

## John.... how can you ever forgive me?
Stand up, John. Let them see you.

## Will the cathedral be finished soon, John?
Yes, very soon.

## Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
No, John, not one that I can see.

## Then I shouldn't change anything?
No, no, I wouldn't change a thing.

## Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling today?
Fine.

## Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in?
Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.

## Won't come out, eh?
No, he's very upset about something.

## Yes sir. What's that?
A dressing bag.

## A dressing bag?
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.

## WHERE IS MR. MERRICK?
I... I don't know what you mean, Sir.

## Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him?
Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.

## YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.

## Pardon me?
Never mind. I'm the owner.

## So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...?
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.

## Well... where is he?
There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.

## WHAT did you say?
I said welcome.

## WELCOME?
Well, of course. We always welcome friends.

## How d'you KNOW we're \"friends\"?
Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.

## What are what?
Those things in your hands.

## What?
Put them down! PLEASE make them put them down.

## WHY?
Yes.

## HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...

## What was she like?
Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...

## That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE...
Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?

## Five this week; how many the week before?
You're as bad as my father.

## Who?
Halfdan the Black.

## YOU still want to go to Asgaard?
Of course.

## Do you believe I love you?
I... but I...

## You don't have to love me. Just, do you believe I love YOU?
Yes -- I believe you do.

## LOKI! Where did YOU come from?
Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans.

## How do we know this is the way?
We blew the Horn Resounding.

## Now what CAN you want with me, Erik the \"Viking\"?
I shouldn't have come.

## What do you see, Erik?
I see the world.

## Is it night or day, Erik?
It is day, of course, Freya.

## Have you ever seen the sun, Erik?
The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.

## Is there nothing men can do?
That I cannot tell you.

## How?
Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...

## Would you like us to sing to you?
That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're...

## You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...

## No... no... We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?
Er... well... we... we... would be TERRIBLY grateful if you... all... would sing for us.

## REALLY?
Really.

## And you're not just saying it because you think we want you to?
No.

## Now I want you to be ABSOLUTELY, totally, genuinely honest with me. Did you really, truly, honestly like it?
No.

## Well, how d'you think I feel?
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.

## Yes?
Careful! They're not supposed to hurt you.

## I know that the Great Blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years, and will keep it for the next thousand.
Why?

## Is there something the matter with it?
Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.

## Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing. You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
Yes... oh, yes...

## Have you done this sort of thing before?
Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.

## Looting and pillaging, eh?
Yes.

## What about the raping?
Shut up.

## No. It isn't rape then, is it?
Oh, get it over with.

## I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?
What d'you expect? You come in here, burn my village, kill my family and try to rape me...

## About raping me?
About NOT raping you...

## You DON'T like it, do you?
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.

## What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.

## Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
To pay for the next expedition, of course.

## You told them I raped you -- why?
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...

## Tell me your name?
I've come to take you back to the land of the living.

## Have you tried to ask the God for anything?
Well... no...

## Is THAT Odin?
But...

## What?
Nothing... Halfdan the Black chopped his hand off last night.

## How deep IS the ocean?
Very deep... usually...

## What's wrong with making friends?
We're missing all the fun...

## What?
We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...

## Who have you been talking to?
I met this girl...

## So? What'd you do to her?
I... I... KILLED her...

## What are YOU doing here?
You may need a real Berserk.

## What \"magic\"?
I've heard stories of a magic that strikes fear into the heart so you cannot fight.

## Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
What \"magic\" have you brought, Erik?

## Why should WE care?
Because... you're... you're the Gods....

## So?
Bring the Age of Ragnarok to an end and stop all this fighting and bloodshed.

## You mean we'd be dead?
Oh... I feel a little... oh...

## Who gets killed?
Nobody gets killed.

## What's the matter with them?
Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place.

## What do you think?
But how could he know... unless...

## And you, Sven, aren't you afraid of crossing the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard?
I will join my grandfather there.

## What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge?
Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.

## What's the matter? Are you afraid to try?
I don't know -- but I'm not afraid to try.

## Hey, you two! What's going on?
I was sitting there.

## Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
I don't want to have to sit next to Snorri all that time.

## Is THIS Hy-Brasil?
We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard...

## What d'you expect me to do?
That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky.

## What's all the panic about?
The Dragon...

## What do we have to do?
Nothing... I just immerse you in water...

## Vanish into thin air?
He hasn't.

## Well, where is he then?
You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard.

## Same thing, isn't it?
No, it is NOT.

## Are you all right?
No, I'm not.

## How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
I mean many of the greatest sailors were.

## And a sort of slightly sick feeling?
That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.

## What are you talking about?
I'm not worth risking your life for.

## Who's that?
It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon...

## What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
Get away, Snorri.

## What have you got there?
Ooh, that's a good one! You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one.

## Wasn't it, Keitel?
Well... I... I thought...

## And you've got BOTH axes?
Yes, Mother.

## And something to sharpen them with?
Yes, Mum.

## Who was the girl you walked off with?
No one.

## But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
And I just liked you so much.

## You did? You liked me?
No, it was lovely.

## May I help you?
Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.

## Ms. Kruczynski?
Hi.

## How are you today?
Okay, I guess.

## Come over after I'm done here?
I can't. I want to, but I have to study.

## In the room?
In the world.

## Oh, baby, what's going on?
I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.

## I didn't have a chance to wrap it.
Come up to Boston with me?

## What's wrong with me?
Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.

## How are you today?
Okay, I guess.

## Well, why don't you tell me what's going on? Do you mind if I turn this on?
Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess.

## You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
What? No. I don't like the term boyfriend. It's so gay.

## Why what?
Why are you sorry? I just said hi.

## Really?
Well, I didn't want to assume.

## Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me, book slave there for, like, five years now.

## Ah, the hair. Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
I can't remember.

## You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?
Oh, I doubt that's the case.

## Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.

## Huckleberry Hound?
I don't know what that means.

## Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
I'm not nuts.

## Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means \"merciful\", right?
Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.

## Shit. Shit. I know it's here. Hold on.
Why wouldn't you think that about me?

## Yes?
I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.

## You're not a stalker or anything, right?
Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.

## You know Wilmont?
Yeah.

## So you like bookstores, huh?
Sort of, um...

## What?
I'm just a bit of a wreck. \"I sleep in your hat\" makes me cry. Me.

## You like that?
Very much.

## Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
I don't know.

## Frost?
It's pretty.

## Ready for another?
No, I'm okay for now.

## What do you want to hear?
You pick it.

## Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.
No, stay. Just for a little while. Refill?

## Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
I don't know.

## It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.

## Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
Yeah.

## You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
No.

## I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
No, not at all.

## You'll call me, right?
Yeah.

## Tomorrow?
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.

## How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?
You didn't say anything about my hair.

## No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?
Let me drive you home.

## Where are you going?
I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.

## Oh shit. I remember this. Want to go?
I want to have a baby.

## Would you get me another, Joely?
You're drunk.

## More?
No. Thanks.

## Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.

## Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
I don't know.

## What do you mean?
Well... if they're looking for me in memories I'm in, what if you take me to a memory I'm not in? And we can hide there till morning.

## They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.
Really? Is he cute?

## Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?
This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me.

## Do you remember what we talked about?
Naomi, I guess.

## What was I wearing?
God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.

## Egad, were you horrified?
No! I think you were wearing that black dress, y'know, with the buttons.

## Is that what you want?
I did it. I guess that means something.

## Yeah?
I'd like to... take you out or something.

## I had you pegged, didn't I?
You had the whole human race pegged.

## Even then I didn't believe you entirely. I thought how could you be talking to me if you couldn't talk to people?
And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.

## You mean, like... Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', Clementine... ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing?
Yeah, like that.

## What do we do?
Enjoy it. Say good-bye.

## yeah?
I'll give you a couple. See what you think.

## Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
I think, before.

## Yeah, yeah. It goes \"Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines\"?
Yes! I love that poem. It breaks my heart. I'm so excited you know it. Look, houses in which we don't live.

## I wish we did. You married?
Um, no.

## Male or female?
Female.

## What are you doing?
It's freezing out here.

## Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
Naomi.

## What if you stay this time?
I walked out the door. There's no more memory.

## So you'll call me, right?
Yeah.

## Tomorrow?
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.

## What if?
I think I should go back.

## Says you were a bully...
Listen, did you want to make love?

## A bully? Moi?
That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.

## What took you so long?
I just walked in.

## Hmmm. Do you miss me?
Oddly enough, I do.

## Did you send this? Is it a joke?
I probably got the same thing as you.

## I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.

## Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.

## How's it going?
Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.

## Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
I just got in.

## Any messages, Carmen?
Right! She called me an old lady here, too! And I remember, I said...

## Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?
She's so sexy.

## So you're still on the Zoloft?
Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.

## Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
Well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on a par with a night of heavy drinking. Nothing you'll miss.

## Yours?
You take it. I don't know.

## So what's going on, Joel?
I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other.

## Hi.
What?

## How was it?
You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.

## So you don't mind?
I've got to finish this chapter anyway.

## So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.

## So you think the dissertation will get published?
I don't know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny.

## Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you?
Nah, I don't know.

## I love quotes. So did Winston Churchill. He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's about Bartlett's. Isn't that trippy?
Yeah. Cool.

## Yeah. Poor guy. Have anything to drink?
We haven't checked.

## Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
Yup.

## You love him, don't you?
It's stopped.

## What?
Listen, it's not erasing.

## Where?
I don't know. He's not on the map.

## This guy's only half cooked. There's no time to fuck around, Stan.
Well, what should we do?

## He's coming?
You better go.

## Do you swear you didn't know?
I swear.

## And you never even suspected? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?
Once, maybe.

## How did I look?
Happy. Happy with a secret.

## And after that?
I never saw you together like that again. So I figured I was imagining things.

## What's this?
Nothing.

## Then why did you ask me?
I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.

## Cole slaw, ice tea?
Thanks.

## How do you mean?
Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.

## Alexander Pope?
It's no big deal.

## Okay. Good. Great. Thanks. I like you, Howard... an awful lot. Is that terrible?
I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.

## Thanks. So... do we talk about this... or what?
I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here.

## Stan? What's going on?
The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.

## Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?
I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.

## Well, where was Patrick?
He went home sick.

## Mary. What are you doing here?
She came to help, Howard.

## Did you try going through C-Gate?
Yeah. Of course.

## Does that help?
Yeah, that looks better. Thanks.

## Yeah?
Just wanted to let you know.

## Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
It's a quote book.

## What was that?
Clockworks.

## Siwash, huh?
But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe.... ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.

## What do you believe in then?
Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.

## Is everything getting worse?
She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.

## You mean she's dead?
But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.

## How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?
That's your problem.

## Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?
I'm staying with the Countess.

## I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
I don't.

## You don't?
Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.

## A traveler, eh?
You might say that, although I don't think of it as traveling.

## Where are the others?
Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home.

## Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?
Learned from the Chink? Oh my. Ha ha. That's hard to say. We mostly.... Uh, a lot of his talk is pretty goofy.

## You don't agree with Debbie, then?
That's Jellybean!

## How did this business get started, anyhow? Why are the birds nesting here?
Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.

## What do you think?
Well.... er...

## Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on?
Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.

## Whose fault was that?
I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault.

## What guy?
I'm cold.

## What are you doing?
Getting dressed. I've got to go.

## Going north?
You bet your raggedy white ass I am.

## Are you in show business?
I was a successful model once.

## For magazines?
I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.

## So now you're bummin' around?
Yep.

## Hitchhiking?
I'm the best.

## You're the best?
Whooee!

## Bonanza Jellybean?
What? Oh yes. Tee-hee. Jellybean.

## A job for me?
I am once more about to make advertising history. And only you, the original Yoni Yum/Dew Girl, could possibly assist me.

## If you don't want me to pose for him, why do you want me to meet him?
Purely personal. I believe you might enjoy one another.

## But here you are, still a virgin -- you are virginal yet, aren't you?
Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...

## I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?
Good, good, good... you'll enjoy it, you'll see. Julian is a gentleman.

## So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?
You still need the rope? I thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins.

## ...do you copy?
Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.

## Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?
Holy shit...

## Justin?
I think I found something...

## EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.
This is Cooper, what the hell do you do on this ship, anyway?

## You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years?
...come on, Skipper, I already put my shoes on...

## Will it work?
It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.

## You been out there a long time. Trying to break my record?
I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can. This ship is bad. It watches you.

## What?
You heard me. This ship, it's crazy, trying to go faster'n light, that's like the Tower of Babel.

## Roger that.
What about the accumulator...?

## What?
Coffee.

## Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?
It is not.

## How? The Bridge is gone.
What's happening?

## Can you shut it down?
I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert...

## No time. We need whatever's left in our suits to repair the Clark. Like it or not, this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers.
What...?

## How is he?
His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen minutes. He might not wake up at all.

## \"Another man?\" Who?
No.

## What is it?
I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.

## \"Save yourself. From Hell.\" What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead.

## What happened?
Weir. He used one of the explosives from the Corridor.

## What's wrong?
Nothing. It's nothing.

## I've got a pulse, he's alive...
What's happening...?

## Pressure?
90 over 50 and falling... .

## Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax?
I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.

## You're not seriously considering sending him?
The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.

## What's on your mind?
He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it. And then there's his wife.

## I want our best people on this. Where's Miller?
The Lewis and Clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt, she's docked in bay four.

## What, Justin, what shows you?
It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...

## What does?
The dark inside me.

## How do you know all this?
But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...

## The crew? Could they still be alive?
The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years.

## What's the hold up?
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers. Good for four months.

## So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan?
Peters is right, no one's here.

## Starck, you still showing those readings?
The blood came from somewhere, Peters...

## What you got, Peters?
Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.

## Alive?
Frozen.

## ...how's the client?
Crystallized.

## ...you okay?
Yeah. I'm -- I'm okay.

## Where has it been for the last seven years?
That's what we're here to find out.

## What does it say?
NSA encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message...

## I can see that, what're they for?
Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep.

## Any survivors?
Negative.

## No one?
They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward.

## What could cause them? What's in the Core?
It's complicated...

## How much time do you need? We have seventeen hours and forty-two minutes. Now, what is in the Core?
It's insane.

## You have something, Dr. Weir?
The date.

## What about it?
The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.

## What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?
You said this ship creates a gateway...

## To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it?
I don't know...

## Where has it been for the past seven years?
I don't know...

## The \"Other Place,\" what is that...?
I DON'T KNOW! I don't know. There's a lot of things going on here that I don't understand. Truth takes time.

## What about my ship?
You... You can't do that!

## What are you talking about?
If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.

## What makes you think I'll miss?
Weir is dead.

## What are you?
Locked and cocked.

## What is that?
Heading three-three-four...

## I noticed. Starck, anybody home?
1500 meters. We're getting too close...

## Starck...
Where is it?

## Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby?
Love to.

## Do we have enough time for a weld?
We don't have time to fart.

## No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?
They're gone.

## I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
I've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. We should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time.

## Now what?
She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.

## What is it, Smith?
I just saw Weir, I think he was messing around on the Clark.

## Come again, Skipper?
One of the explosives is missing from the corridor. I think Weir may have put it on the Clark.

## Justin?
Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes.

## Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?
I just finished drying...

## Radiation interference?
There's not enough radiation to throw off the scan. I'm picking up trace life forms, but I can't get a lock on the location.

## Everybody okay?
We're all here.

## How much oh-two do we have?
Oxygen is not the problem.

## Carbon dioxide?
It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.

## What's causing the readings?
I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.

## So where is the rest of the crew? We've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. Dr. Weir? Any suggestions?
What's the point? I'll just get the same thing...

## Maybe one of the original crew?
No. It was someone else.

## Who?
Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something...

## What is it, Starck?
...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...

## \"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin,\" don't you have anything useful to tell me?
I've got a theory.

## To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...

## If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time?
I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have.

## What's going on in there, Starck?
Justin's in the airlock.

## What?
He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.

## Blow it up?
We blow the Corridor. Use the foredecks as a lifeboat, separate it from the rest of the ship. We stay put...

## First time in a grav couch?
Yes.

## He's been past Mars?
He served on the Goliath.

## Wasn't that ship destroyed?
Claire...

## Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.

## Can you see a body?
There's no one here.

## Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
I've seen bodies before. This is different.

## Can you shut it down?
Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it.

## Do you know what it was?
Almost got it.

## You got any coffee?
It's cold.

## Where is she?
Dead ahead, 5000 meters.

## What the hell is that?
That's the Core, the gravity drive. The heart of the ship.

## What?
It still has air and reserve power, we can activate gravity and life support.

## What happened to his eyes?
Explosive decompression.

## How?
A straight line.

## Could it be the crew? If they were in suspended animation, wouldn't that effect the scan?
If they were in stasis, I'd get a location, but these readings, they're all over the ship. It doesn't make any sense.

## What is it?
Ship's log.

## What is it?
I don't know. The life readings just went off the scale.

## Claire is your wife?
Yes.

## What are you doing?
It wants me. I have to go.

## What is it?
The forward airlock.

## Justin said something about, \"The dark inside me...\" What did he mean?
It means nothing.

## I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
I'm not really dressed for a party.

## Those yours too?
My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.

## Way to not overthink it. So when do we leave?
I'll schedule the launch. Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.

## Is it safe?
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.

## Well why didn't you say so? You want me to lift some weights or something?
You look like an eighties rock band.

## Where is Reed?
Victor must've taken him.

## What are you doing here?
I'm worried about you.

## What is this? Where's Reed?
Where do you think? With Sue.

## What do you want, Vic?
I'll be watching over you.

## Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said \"together forever no matter what\"?
Baby, you're scaring me.

## Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?
Deb, it's me. It's still me.

## What did you wish for, honey?
I already got it. Everything I want.

## What about his first born?
Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.

## When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
Five times.

## Isn't that your speech?
He's made a few changes.

## Should?
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.

## Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
Solid.

## Are you alright?
I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.

## You got a chisel round here?
If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.

## Where... where am I?
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.

## Reed?... Sue?
They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.

## That's terrible news...
What's wrong with me?

## I mean, you feel a little feverish.
And where do we think we're going?

## Victor's right. Johnny, get to the command center. Close the shields.
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?

## Now what is up with that?
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.

## Ben, are you there?
This is wrong in so many ways.

## This place is deluxe. You got cable?
...and figure out how to reverse them. Let me show you to your rooms.

## A higher calling like getting girls and making money?
I think that thing is Ben.

## Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.

## Is that what you call it? \"Real\"?
At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.

## And if he's not...?
Reed's always right. Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...

## Leonard, how's the feed?
Recording, sir. We see you perfectly.

## Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar \"humanizes\" you.
How's the IPO?

## Front page?
Top left, like you asked. Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows... maybe Washington.

## Feeling better?
Passion.

## What?
We need to get past them.

## How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
That's what we're here to find out.

## Are you kidding?
No, I distinctly remember, you walked out my door. Ergo...

## What are you doing?
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --

## But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed...?
Of course. Of course.

## Reed. How close are we to a cure?
No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.

## You were?
Of course I was. I'd read all your papers on bioethics. Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.

## You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
I gave him twenty.

## Why didn't you say something?
That would have kinda defeated the purpose. And Reed... I'm saying it now.

## This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
Not at all.

## Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
Hilarious.

## Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
Ben did this.

## Ben did this?
He's had some kind of... reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one.

## I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
What I should have done a long time ago. Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.

## Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
I understand the business reasons.

## What are you doing?
Raising the shields.

## Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.

## Arnold. What's happening?
Brad, I really fuckin' hate McDonald's, man. Ever since they started in with the chicken, everything went downhill.

## You want to work at Carl's?
Of course.

## How much did they cost?
Don't worry about it.

## Come on, Spicoli. Why don't you just put your shirts back on? See the sign?
Go ahead. Just make it quick.

## Hamilton, come over here. What is that you've got on?
Yes. I think so. Show some pride, Hamilton.

## Look. Just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. Okay? Please, Brad?
I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here.

## Why can't you do it?
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.

## Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?
They're not home yet.

## I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
I'll explain everything later.

## Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.

## Is everything okay at work?
Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.

## You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you?
I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single, successful guy. I think I want my freedom.

## Where did you hear that?
I'm just guessing.

## Why?
It's just Linda. And Mark from school.

## Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway?
Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad...

## You're not going to tell me, are you?
No.

## Any problems?
No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis.

## Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton?
They were left over from the last shift.

## Did you threaten this man or use profanity in any way?
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.

## Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
Well, that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi.

## O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay?
I can't wait until I can drive next year. I walk every day. It's such a drag.

## You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?
Mark is a really nice boy...

## Do you have any ice tea?
Sure. Come on in.

## I guess the annuals are coming in pretty soon. Are you going to get one?
I don't know.

## Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
I know what I look like.

## Do you want to take a quick swim?
Well...

## Are you really a virgin?
Come on...

## Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike?
You first.

## How about both of us at the same time?
I want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not.

## What? Are you all right?
I think we're making a lot of noise.

## I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
I guess I did.

## What's going on?
Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it.

## Why don't you call me up tonight?
Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant.

## We've got to get an abortion?
Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.

## Doesn't sound free to me. So you want me to pay for it?
Half. Okay? Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.

## All right... where did you see her?
She's in my biology class.

## Did you get her number?
No.

## Did you get her name?
No. It's too soon.

## You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
Okay. Okay. Here's what you do.

## Yeah?
Ace the jacket.

## Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?
All right. Pay attention.

## Mark. What happened to your date?
It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.

## Damone, are you there?
I'm really pretty busy...

## I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back?
No Damone. I don't understand.

## Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?
Jesus. I'm sorry.

## Sensitive -- what is that?
Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.

## So what makes you so sensitive?
Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people.

## What do you read? What's the last book you read?
Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.

## Are you Linda Barrett?
Yes.

## And they don't call my parents?
Not if you're over sixteen.

## How've you been?
Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.

## How often do you go?
I don't go at all.

## Well, it pretty much speaks for itself. Peter, you want to run with it?
Merv, this is the action down at Sunset Cliffs at about six in the morning.

## Who's that?
That's me, Merv.

## Are you going to ride that wave?
Totally.

## What's going through your mind right here, Jeff? The danger of it all?
Hey, slow down. This is my brother's car.

## Naw. Any good?
Suzanne Somers' tits.

## What the fuck is this guy doing?
This ain't no cop.

## Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.

## Don't you like him?
Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.

## So what did you do?
I can't do that.

## He was hot, wasn't he?
If I didn't have a fianc in Chicago, I'd go for it.

## Do you think guys find that attractive?
Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them.

## What variables?
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.

## What's the big deal?
Well I never did it.

## Was it great?
It was okay.

## So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.

## Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him.

## Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen?
I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out.

## Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?
Sixteen.

## Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
Why don't you put your mother's secret book back?

## Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.

## Does that ever happen?
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.

## What's Doug do in Chicago?
He works for the airline. He'll be out here. You'll meet him.

## What do you think?
I think they're both virgins.

## I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda?
No.

## Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips?
God, I don't think so. Better look in the house.

## What do you think it is?
It couldn't be.

## What?
You didn't tell me that they can be so nice, so great... but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they're five years old.

## What do you want?
I want romance.

## Where's Doug?
He's not coming.

## Not coming? What happened?
He says he's got to stay in Chicago. He says I should visit him sometimes.

## Sometime?
Yeah, like maybe never.

## But what are you going to do?
Well I might go to Dartmouth.

## I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.

## What class?
This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window.

## Can I come in?
Oh, please. I get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and I don't see all my kids here.

## Mr. Spicoli?
That's the name they gave me.

## Thank you, Desmond. What's the reason for your truancy?
I couldn't make it in time.

## You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.

## Food will be eaten on your time! Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
I don't know.

## Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.

## Mr... Mr. Hand.
I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time?

## Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff?
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.

## Do you want to sit there, Jeff?
I don't know. I guess so.

## Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
Well, you'll find out next year.

## How about your phone number?
Thanks for picking me up.

## Where do you feel like going?
I don't know. Wherever you want.

## How about the point?
The point sounds fine.

## Are you really nineteen?
Yes... I am really nineteen.

## What about those other guys you live with?
No. I mean back to your home.

## Is this your first time?
Yes.

## What do you do with the jackets people leave here?
We keep them.

## My other question is... can-I-have your-phone-number-so-I-can-ask-you out-sometime?
Do you have a pen? This one's out of ink.

## Do you have Mrs. George for English?
Yeah. She is pretty good.

## Do you know what you want?
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.

## Are you all right?
Oh yeah.

## Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
Not at all.

## Aren't your parents asleep?
No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.

## I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
No. That's okay.

## Thanks. So... What do you want to do?
I don't know.

## Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
Sure.

## This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?
Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.

## Do you really have to go?
Well... it's getting kind of late.

## Where's Mike today?
Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.

## What's April 16th?
It's John Bonham's birthday.

## John Bonham?
Oh. I see.

## What about the notes?
I'll get you the notes.

## Hi, Stacy. How are you?
Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual.

## Really?
Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.

## Are you ready to order here?
Well... sure. She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.

## Anything to drink?
Two Cokes.

## I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?
Yes... It makes sense.

## Awake? What do you mean?
Of course. But if I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast. He's a very crude man.

## But he will be available? Perhaps later this morning?
The woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed. I think she was crying...

## Crying? Why was she crying?
Well, uh. She didn't say Mr. Duke. But since I know you're here with the Police Convention...

## What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.

## Naked!?
Naked.

## WHAT?
Hell, no. We'd never hear the goddamn end of it.

## What?
I'm a whiskey man myself. We don't have much trouble from drugs where I come from...

## And nobody did anything?
Yeh. The big guy used to be a major in the Marines.

## Really?
That's how he got so big. When he quit the Marines he was just a little guy.

## Where ya comin' from, young man?
Las Vegas.

## What?
Thanks for the ride. Thanks a lot. I like you guys. Don't worry about me.

## Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?
It's okay. He's admiring the shape of your skull.

## Indeed. We must do it. What kind of story is this?
The medicine? Yes, it's right here.

## Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine.
You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!

## How long do I have?
Thirty minutes. It was going to be very close.

## But what about our room? And the golf shoes?
No, no. Don't leave me!

## What are you talking about?
That's good...

## Why what?
Holy shit! They almost had us there! That was quick thinking.

## Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine. Watch out!... Why money? My name is Brinks; I was born... Born?
Get sheep over side... women and children to armored car... orders from Captain Zeep.

## Not much. Why?
I have to go.

## GO?
Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.

## Can we make it?
That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.

## When does this thing stop?
It won't stop. It's not ever going to stop.

## Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
Don't go near that elevator. That's just what they want us to do... trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement.

## What for?
Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.

## What limes?
They didn't have any. They don't grow in the desert.

## Have you made a deal with him? Did you put him on to her?
Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight. I have to put the car in the lot.

## What tape?
Jefferson Airplane. \"White Rabbit.\" I want a rising sound.

## How about a check?
Whatever's right.

## You bastard! You'd do that, wouldn't you?
Lucy.

## What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?
It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses. Anything that she says about us is completely worthless.

## Us?
Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet Barbra...

## Me?
OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call her. I'll get her off our backs. You're right. She's my problem.

## What is this?
You won't need much. Just a little tiny taste, that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger-beer. Adrenochrome.

## Where'd you get this?
Never mind, it's absolutely pure.

## Man I'll try about anything; but I'd never touch a pineal gland.
Some of what?

## FINISH THE FUCKING STORY! What happened?! What about the glands?
So do we, lady.

## Do you think you can handle it?
Alright, Alice... you'll be contacted by Inspector Rock. Arthur Rock. He'll be posing as a politician.

## How much is the lemon meringue pie?
Alice. Just ring Linen Service and ask for Alice.

## Could I have that, please?
Why not? It was getting warm anyway.

## Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
I'll try. I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time. I've heard a lot about it.

## Part of what?
One phone call every day. Just tell us what you've seen. Don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem.

## Oh, and don't bother to make up the room. That way we won't have to risk another of these little incidents, will we?
Um, yeah, thirty miles east.

## We'll meet in three hours?
I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...

## Where are you two going?
We're going to get my little girl.

## Yeah.
Where is everyone?

## IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
Nah, I got the gun.

## My god damn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?
Her fella.

## Gonna stay for a couple?
I have a CB in my truck, we could get some help out here.

## Who the hell would you call?
Anyone.

## Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
We shot a skunk.

## Where's that?
If we move in a group, we are one target. If we scatter, they CAN'T get us all.

## And the rest of 'em?
Unfortunately, the worst of 'em are still outside.

## So, your husband ditched you?
No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran. He just ran.

## What tunnel? Where?
It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.

## What's it for?
HEY! No, I'm not trusting him either, that's why you and I will both be going with him.

## You all sure about this?
Follow me.

## Where's the tunnel?
Of course not. I fight monsters all the time.

## What?
Look.

## That's an unwise thing to say, you know that?
Just an observation.

## Why don't you go check it out?
Fuck no.

## Any more ideas Animal Planet?
You weren't helpin'.

## Oh yeah?
Well then I guess we should just give up.

## He's dead.
Who's with me?

## What now, Geronimo?
My truck.

## Why do you take shit from him?
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.

## Your brother, huh?
Yep.

## Your parents of relation?
We lived near power lines.

## Anyone else?
We're going to get help.

## Anybody else?
We gotta be close.

## My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back, I can get in the front and we roll out of here.
What?

## What's in the back?
Nothing, this was my last delivery.

## But not flush against the tunnel?
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.

## How are you holding up?
Well...

## What is this?
Magic potion. You should try a little.

## Really?
Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.

## Will I go crazy or something?
No, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off like a beer, but in a fraction of the time.

## Why not then?
Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.

## Doesn't your foot hurt?
I can't feel a thing, Hon.

## You wanna see, baby?
Sure.

## How much you got to see the show?
You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.

## What? Really?
Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.

## Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
He's dead.

## What?
Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense.

## So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
He only shot you once.

## Huh?
He shot you the other time.

## Will these boards hold?
Good.

## What's going on between you two?
Nothing.

## What's it for!?
Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.

## Is it gassed up?
Fully.

## Four door?
Two.

## Open?
Covered.

## How many?
Holds four.

## Max?
Seven.

## Nine?
Seven.

## What's that!? Wha'cha say? Huh?
Get outta here.

## Oh? And what's that?
Sit still, look less like a meal.

## Hey, when this plan completely goes to shit, what are ya gonna do?
Bullshit.

## Eh, Chief?
Duh hickey.

## What?
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.

## Get something on that.
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?

## There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where that is?
You don't want the rag to touch the booze, that way you can hold it awhile and ensure it explodes when you throw it.

## You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
I'm sure.

## Am I too heavy for you?
Yeah, I'll go.

## What's wrong?
Nothing, just lookin'.

## If there is only one way out for us, there is only one way in for them.
She's not very nice, is she?

## Oh my God... What is that?
That's one piece of four problems.

## We all have to be strong, right?
Right.

## Hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?
Um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present, sir.

## Do you have a note to corroborate these claims?
Um, well...

## Are you lying to me?
Well...

## What did we say about lying?
I'm not lying.

## You know that no one likes a liar, right?
I said I'm not lying.

## What have you done now, broke the darn thing?
I just hit it like you said.

## Look, Frances, I didn't want this job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged me, improve your image. So please... lemme try, huh?
You're right. I'm sorry. Okay, let's go get 'em.

## So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?
Come on. They make you feel nice and peppy.

## What're you doing?
Putting on my armor.

## Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.

## Forgive'...? For What?
I'm sorry... that was an unfortunate choice of words.

## Excuse me, sir?
Frances Farmer, contract player, six- month option.

## Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more?
I guess so, sir.

## Hi Frances, got a minute?
Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.

## That's not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is very concerned about your politics. He hears you've been donating money, speaking at rallies.
My clothes?

## Good, good. Give them that.
I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?

## Madam...?
Thank you.

## Who is she?
I'm not afraid of struggle, Clifford.

## Where's Clifford?
He's not here.

## What's up?
I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.

## You don't think I'm good enough?
What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it.

## Who?
Right now we have to be practical.

## Does Clifford even know? You didn't tell him, did you? I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?
He knows, Frances.

## Hey, where's the fire, sister?
In my eyes, officer.

## Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?
I didn't make the law, lady. I just enforce it.

## You learn your lines?
Sort of.

## Fired?
Yeah. She said she delivered your message and that you'd understand.

## There was another call too. From your agent. He says your summer stock deal is all set. So you're going back east, huh?
...Yes.

## Dick...
You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?

## I gotta go now.
No?

## We're all square now, Harry. Right?
All square, Doc.

## ...Don't you?
No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better.

## You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.

## One question. If I'm not myself now, just who do you think I am?
Harry? Oh Harry, I knew you'd come. I love you, Harry. I love... Take me home, Harry.

## Thank you.
Really?

## ...until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. Were you mentally ill, Frances?
...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one...

## Were you an alcoholic?
No.

## Were you a drug addict?
No. Never.

## Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?
He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.

## Is Kaminski a Communist?
No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.

## He's a socialist, then?
It's already started, Dad... with me.

## You really want to go?
Of course.

## And you think it's worth all this?
If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.

## ...So what do you think?
I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.

## Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?
Always. Always.

## Bread?
Thank you.

## When's the last time you saw a hundred dollars, Ernest Farmer?
You're poisoning that child's mind.

## See you next weekend?
Fifteen.

## I'm really sad it's closing. Now what am I gonna do on Tuesday nights?
You can always come see it in London.

## Only if you were in it. Are you?
I wouldn't miss it.

## Are you really serious? About acting?
Why... yes.

## Why?
I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.

## Aren't you ever going back?
...Not if I can help it.

## What?
Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean.

## Okay then...
What is this?

## Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?
Not me. But other people seem to.

## Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
No... Actually, you look more like a cop.

## I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then?
Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.

## Harry.
Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you?

## Well? What'd you think?
I just wanted to see how you looked.

## How'd I look?
Enh.

## You looked okay. Joint's pretty dead. How 'bout I take you home?
Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.

## What?
Quietly.

## What happened to him?
He retired to Florida... made a killing in vending machines.

## What?
Well... don't you think it's up to me to...

## Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
Came to get a tan.

## Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason?
Kaminski.

## What?
They killed him. They threw him out that window.

## But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it?
You jackass! C'mon, let's get out of here.

## Serious, huh?
Yeah.

## Forget it.
Is that why you did it?

## No, they don't, do they?
Frances, you're a movie star now. If you give them what they want, you can get anything.

## What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know?
What's left of my blood.

## Nice joint. Can you afford it?
Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.

## What for?
For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.

## So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
Beats me.

## You're coming.
Hey look, I got some business down in San Diego. Whattaya say you come with me, stay a few days?

## And?
Take a walk, pal.

## Who said I was a lady?
Oh my God, I look awful.

## That sure looks like fun... You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel?
Forget it, Frances. You're not driving.

## Where are we, mean man?
Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut across to Montana. I've got friends there with a ranch.

## What?
This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...

## Whattaya think you're in now?
I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...

## Huh?
I guess.

## What's that?
You can't drink.

## Huh?
You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.

## Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again, Will you marry me?
Well... I'll act like I do until I do.

## Will you marry me?
It's not too late to keep going, up to Vancouver? Be the smartest thing.

## You give up on her?
...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig.

## Where to?
Oh Harry...

## Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?
I don't know.

## Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.

## How did I look?
Oh, you... ...ennh.

## I got a new car. Only it's red. Did you know Mama died?
Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.

## Why do you say that?
I'd ask you to take me home, but I'm a faceless sinner. ...You smell good, Harry. Familiar, you know? I'd ask you to take me home, but...

## It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?
I'm not sure.

## Very slow. But we're not going to stop, are we?
No.

## Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
That would be okay.

## Where you goin'?
Wherever they're going, I'm going.

## Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...

## What'd you do?
No, I couldn't get my hands on one.

## Did you expect him to look you up?
Why, certainly. I wanted to get a peek at his face...

## Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.

## Who're you?
I live here.

## What?
I'm preparin' it for the next tenant, he's coming in tomorrow.

## I already have.
And what's the title of this seduc... assault?

## How's it sound?
The speech? Real good.

## You think I got it?
You got it.

## Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand?
It isn't in your hands, Mama. It's my life.

## Why are these all opened?
Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.

## Then why did you bring them?
It's your fan mail, little sister.

## What?
Go on...

## Frances, you remember my lawyer, Alma Styles?
Oh Mama, I'm so... tired of that song.

## What's wrong?
Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.

## Where are you going?
For a walk, Mama. Just a walk.

## How long will you be?
Not long.

## At one. Promise?
Sure.

## You... You'd send me back, wouldn't you? You would.
Mama...?

## I will, I promise.
Where are you going?

## Do I go right away or do I have time to take a bath?
I was hoping for a kind word, little sister.

## Don't I know you?
WIFE I don't believe so.

## Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
Thanks are hardly necessary.

## Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do?
Please sit down...

## And what's that?
Normal. Average.

## ...Did you really say that?
Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.

## Is there something else?
You didn't say 'Symington says'.

## ...I'm sorry to keep you waiting, the staff review ran over. Did you enjoy your mother's visit?
Yes. It was very good to see her.

## Really? Any problems?
You're telling me you feel guilty.

## I'm sorry. She misunderstood, that's all.
Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you?

## But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?
Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.

## You what?
I'm sure you'll see it my way in the end.

## Sedate her.
Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?

## I don't know why they even bother. She's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant.
And do you think it's radical for a man to have a job and feed a family?

## Yeah?
I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight.

## And he drove me to mine.
What?

## Then why weep for him?
Would you not? He was father. And mother. We fell from grace together. He from his God. I from mine.

## What kindness?
Build for him a pyre. Light up the sky with his passing.

## The music? Or the fire?
I'm glad you finally came to the door. A man shouldn't have to scurry in the shadows.

## Why?
I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.

## Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man. I've been waiting for you. Two months now.
Friends? Do they live around here?

## How did you find me?
The letters in your journal. That and a geography book. Your Elizabeth sounds lovely.

## Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
Fine words from a child killer. You who murdered my brother.

## Evil? Do you believe in evil?
I see it before me.

## Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking?
There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.

## What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out? Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?
Materials. Nothing more.

## You're wrong. Do you know I knew how to play this?
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.

## What can I do?
There is something I want. A friend.

## Friend?
A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.

## Soon?
Yes. I want this over and done with.

## Why... her?
Her body pleases me.

## What is this?
One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl- two-three...

## Are you all right?
Let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night I left. He's coming home to marry me.

## Is he not back yet?
Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.

## Are you sure it can't hurt us?
Nothing can. Not ever.

## How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?
It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will.

## What kind of God is He to will this?
God took her from us.

## Quite a send-off, isn't it?
Father's so proud.

## And you?
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.

## You will. What do you want, Victor?
I've loved you all my life

## Brother and sister still?
I wish to be your husband.

## They've done a fine job. Hanging an innocent for the crime of a fiend.
But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?

## Do you know this man? Is there something between you?
It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.

## We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.
Why the change? What about your work?

## Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.

## This ice will break yet. How's our guest?
He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil. Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.

## You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.

## Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
No. But someday.

## Professor?
Oh God.

## Are you having me on?
Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane.

## Do you really think I'm mad?
Come now. Magnus? Agrippa? Next thing you know, you'll be teaching toadstools to speak.

## Can you think of a better reason?
Quite a few.

## How much longer?
Few months perhaps. I'm gathering the raw materials even now.

## This is a bad time, Henry. I'm busy just now. What do you want?
Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down.

## Yes? And?
Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.

## A... week?
We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm.

## You've been going round-the-clock?
We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.

## Victor. This place looked like a charnel house. What went on here?
Quite a place.

## For what?
This. My home. My family. If not for you, I'd be dead in a burial pit somewhere.

## What happened up there?
I didn't find what I was looking for.

## Are you sure you'll be all right?
Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.

## Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.

## Philosophical?
Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect. Paracelsus, for one.

## Paracelsus?
Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...

## What is your name?
Victor Frankenstein, sir. Of geneva.

## Of Geneva. Tell me, Mr. Frankenstein of Geneva. Do you wish to study medicine? Or mysticism?
You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum.

## You disdain accepted wisdom?
No, I embrace it... as something to be used or discarded as we advance the boundaries of what is known.

## Why?
Our profession needs talent like yours. Destroy your career over an issue of pride? What a waste.

## Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system?
Victor. He was trying to be gracious.

## How is it you come to be here?
Ah. An explorer.

## You know of it?
Your men are right to be afraid.

## You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
Lives are ephemeral. The knowledge we gain, the achievements we leave behind... those live on.

## Who are you?
My name is Frankenstein...

## Jack? Marcie? Ned?
It's just this place. The storm. That's why you're all upset.

## So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?
Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...

## What'd you see?
I don't know. Marcie's got me paranoid.

## Any particular reason?
Just a feeling. Nothing personal.

## You want to leave?
I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.

## Alice? The others show up?
Everybody except the girl who's supposed to handle the kitchen. Annie.

## You think you're gonna last all summer?
I'm not sure I'll last all week. I'll tell Steve.

## Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?
Un-hunh.

## How come you're leaving?
It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.

## Maybe I can help?
And it's this place. It makes no sense, but it spooks me.

## What'll you do when you leave here?
I don't know.

## I didn't know I was asleep... What time is it?
Almost five.

## How the... did he get in there?
Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume.

## Trouble?
Bad bulb or no power. It's getting a little gloomy in here.

## Help you clean up?
Absolutely.

## Where?
They're off now.

## It's dead. Try the pay phone.
Jack?

## Do you have a dime? A quarter?
No. There must be some in the desk somewhere.

## What's the matter with it?
Wet. I don't know.

## Why don't we run? Just run now?
It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.

## How come?
Some campers drowned. Then some counselors got killed.

## Ned? We're gonna be working together for a while. You're a nice guy without all the entertainment, okay?
Sure.

## Give me a hand?
For sure.

## Get behind him more.
What is it?

## Chance to get even?
I'll spot you five points.

## Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry?
I don't believe you...

## What do you want to be when you grow up?
Dancer.

## No wonder they lost America. How could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that? What's to eat?
Whatever you make yourself.

## What hath God wrought?
That was the telephone.

## Jack?
Coach, athletic director somewhere.

## How about our last jay?
Good call.

## What about Neddy?
I don't love Neddy.

## You? The brick?
It's just a dream.

## Are you wet?
Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.

## Mmmmmmmph?
Mmmmmmmph.

## Whassamatta?
Gotta pee. You're lying on my bladder.

## Doctor. Now, if you were a flavor of ice cream, what would you be?
Rocky Road.

## You okay?
Those things can be nasty.

## Anything else you want?
No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.

## How much do I owe you?
One night on the town.

## Why not?
You've made a science out of coincidence.

## How many with you?
Just my son and I.

## What is your purpose in Mexico?
Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight.

## What was that?
Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.

## Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?
I don't know, one place's as good as another.

## Have you ever been there before?
Well, because you picked that place out of a hat, my brother's dead now. And this girl's family's dead.

## I'm sorry to hear that. What were they, psychos?
Did they look like psychos? They were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't explode when sunlight hits 'em, I don't care how crazy they are.

## Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up to you?
You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start.

## You like the car?
I said new, this is an '90.

## So do I just follow you?
The truth hurts.

## Why do you want to stop?
I'm exhausted.

## What's this guy's problem?
I have no idea.

## What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna try and get us across the border.

## Have you forgotten about your sister?
They're gonna kill us. They get us across the border, they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us.

## What about Kate?
They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance.

## What's your name?
Jacob.

## What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags?
He's my son.

## What's this about, money?
On the dresser.

## Come again?
If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.

## Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical, ain't it? What am I askin' for, of course it is. What are their names?
Scott and Kate.

## Who's this?
My wife.

## Where is the little lady?
In heaven.

## She's dead?
Yes, she is.

## How'd she die?
Auto wreck.

## Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?
No. It was a rainy night, the brakes on the car weren't great. She had to stop suddenly. She slid on the road, she crashed, she died.

## Died instantly?
Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.

## Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
Yes, they do.

## Is this real?
Yes.

## You're a preacher?
I was a minister.

## Was? As in not anymore?
Yes.

## How do I know you'll keep your word?
Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.

## Didn't like it, did ya?
No, I didn't.

## You won't let him touch her?
I can handle Richie, don't worry.

## As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
I don't have the slightest idea.

## Then?
Then stop, 'cause that's where we're going.

## Who else?
Pass.

## Why not, against your religion?
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.

## Why are you so agitated?
I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.

## What are you going to do?
Before we stepped in here, you told all of us to be cool. That means you, too.

## What did you call me?
To your family.

## Now, is your shit together?
Forever together.

## You too, preacher?
I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.

## Did he...?
Yep.

## What's this stuff?
Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.

## Kate, Scott?
It's the bitterest of pills.

## I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore?
I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.

## What do you think Mom would say?
Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.

## You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?
No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead.

## Scott?
We're having a wet bikini contest, and you just won.

## Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?
Sure.

## Where are you taking us?
Mexico.

## What's in Mexico?
Mexicans.

## Do what?
What you said to me in the room.

## Creepy guy.
What did I say?

## You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said?
Yes.

## Do you believe me?
Yes.

## You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
Yeah, we got a bible.

## How about you, cutie pie? Ready for round two?
Okay.

## Are you okay?
I'm really sorry.

## How many bullets left, kid?
Not many.

## Should I use the last bullets on us?
You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you.

## Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best.

## Not even for lunch?
I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave.

## Well, if there ain't there sure oughta be. Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid's mind?
You could sue the shit out of her, ya know. That kid belongs under a circus tent, not flippin' burgers. You could own that fuckin' place.

## That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
Four Rangers, three cops, and two civilians. And they took a lady bank teller as a hostage.

## What dya mean?
This is a private club. You're not welcome.

## I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order.
Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?

## What the fuck was that about?
He signaled the Ranger.

## You believe me don't cha?
Shut up and start the car.

## He didn't recognize shit.
Richie? You okay?

## Do they have cable?
No.

## Do they have an X-rated channel?
No.

## Do they have a waterbed?
They don't have anything except four walls and a roof, and that's all we need.

## How's it feel?
How ya think, it hurts like a son-of- a-bitch.

## I got both rooms on either side of us, so we don't gotta worry about eavesdropping assholes. How's that feel? You okay?
Feels good.

## Did you even to try to negotiate?
All I'm saying --

## Shit, I started to get worried. Where the fuck ya been?
Sight seein'.

## What'd ya see?
Cops.

## Yeah, I saw the border. Through binoculars from on top of a high building. That's about as close as I risked getting. What's the TV say?
They're going to apprehend us in forty-eight hours.

## What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin' woman, the hostage. Where the fuck is she, Richard!?
There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.

## What?
This isn't gonna work.

## What?
You just called me a fuckin' nut.

## I'm curious. What was the nuttiest thing I did?
This ain't the time.

## Yeah, I think so. What happened?
I don't know, you just passed out.

## I did?
Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.

## Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?
Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.

## Far out. Where are my glasses?
They broke when you fell.

## That's what you think?
That's how you're lookin', Richie.

## I'm lookin' scared?
That's what you look like.

## No, Richie, what do I look like?
You're lookin' green.

## Where are you?
I'm here with you.

## Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask your new friend to join us?
Yeah.

## Scarred for life, that's how I am!
Okay, I'll have one.

## Who's \"we\"?
Okay, but... You didn't have to do what you did. Not for me.

## Who signed as his \"sponsoring officer\"?
Uh... don't see it. There's no signature. But hang on -- there's a note to \"See Addendum.\" Checking...

## Your prerogative, Senator.
What'd you find, Kathy?

## Awright. How's our girl doin', anyway?
Standing right here in my office.

## Jordan, dear. How are they treating you?
Uh, V.I.P. security arrangements generally take some time, Senator.

## Thank you, sir.
\"Security\"? What the hell you talkin' about? Your base isn't secure?

## Would you care for a beverage? Tea?
None at this time, sir.

## All right, lieutenant, give me a name and specifics, I'll have the X.O. file an action first thing in the morning. A name?
It's you, sir. And it started the day I came here.

## Pardon?
I think you've resented me from the start, sir.

## No, sir, WHAT?
The shape doesn't bother me. It's just that goddamn rotten stench.

## Well. 'Least now we're talking the same language. So one standard. Is that what you're after?
Same rules for everyone, sir.

## Straight up?
Across the board, sir.

## So I'll get a fair shot?
You'll get everything you want, O'Neil. Let's see if you want what you're gonna get.

## Permission to leave, sir?
Permission to evaporate, O'Neil.

## Sir? What did he say?
Entering my scan now...

## West?
Shit. Think we're had.

## O'Neil. Our air's gonna crap out as soon as we get down there. You know that, don't you?
White House boys want a private meeting.

## Think I overplayed it?
Congress and the Pentagon share a lot of plumbing. They'll never know whose leak it is.

## Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy. I must seriously question whether --
I was one member of the investigating commission.

## So everyone I talk to says you're top drawer with silk stockings inside.
Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's. And your conclusion was \"pilot error,\" hmm?

## Thank you, ma'am. Um, may I ask what this is regarding?
\"Coronado.\"

## I know that, sir. Ma'am. It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?
Captain Dwyer. Technically.

## Would I be the only one? The only woman?
Absolutely not.

## What changed?
Should probably ask him that.

## So? Isn't the President jumping on your bandwagon?
You don't know that.

## What are you saying? That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?
You were never going to let women serve in combat. You always had a safety net. Or thought you did.

## You promise Wickwire a fast ticket, too?
I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began. And that's quite verifiable.

## You'll think about my offer?
You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it. If I spoke with him.

## So she picks the women, we pick the programs. Seals?
1 I'd go Special Reconnaissance. Every bit as tough -- and we have a 60 percent drop-out rate among the men.

## What the hell is the President trying to do? Steal DeHaven's thunder?
1 I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly.

## Montgomery, why do they call you \"Flea\"?
It's really \"F. Lee Montgomery\" -- but that gets whittled down to just \"Flea.\" For short, ma'am.

## So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
No, ma'am.

## Hey. You okay, Flea?
Snot me. It's him.

## Sir?
You broke a dozen training rules back there -- before I lost count.

## She's a trainee, just like the others. Why are you coming down so hard?
She's an officer. There's a higher standard.

## The Chief was granted early retirement as of 17-hundred yesterday. By 18-hundred he was gone. Out of the Navy.
What \"all females\"? If I'm the only --

## Just a coincidence?
Maybe it's not my place to speculate on his private thoughts. But I think the Chief knew that his way -- his world -- had come and gone.

## Do we know it's him using the beacon? Not a decoy?
Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.

## Chances of recovery?
You're the analyst for East China, O'Neil. Analyze.

## Only four minutes to neutral waters, sir. Why not?
That was good headwork, lieutenant.

## Thank you, sir. We hear back from the Pentagon?
Probably hear back from CNN first.

## So why're you even considering it? Are you?
Just like you would be.

## Wai', wait. What happens if it works? Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?
I don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, Jordan. Maybe we should just let it happen.

## I've been trying you for five days. Don't they give you messages?
It's hard to find time to sleep, Royce. Much less keep up with my phone life.

## Don't you know? How they're talking about you?
I saw an article...

## So why are you telling me this?
That's not what I want, Jordan. I mean... it is and it isn't...

## Almost like someone put him up to it. Okay, who?
No shortage of suspects.

## The Chief? Or maybe even Turrentine? Your C.O.?
C'mon, Jordan. Do the headwork with me.

## Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
Well, before you crawl off to die, Jordan, give me five minutes of good headwork.

## Instructors typically pull three year assignments. This guy's in and out in one year -- your year. That sound right?
Wickwire said he was dry-docked in Washington between stints at Coronado...

## Whose orders were those?
It was made clear. Anyway, stay ballsy. First week's hell, then it levels out. Until S.E.R.E. training, anyway. That's hell-and-a-half.

## And how do you know that?
Made it to Week 10 last time.

## Who is it?
You know, I had an apartment about this size once.

## Wick. They got your crew, too?
Intagliata was out chasing breakfast. They found his tracks. Well, shit.

## You really came back for more? Of this?
If you got a good one, Wick...

## They had to kill 'em?
That's a good story.

## He was married?
At first.

## How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part?
Last time I didn't.

## Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four. Don't wanna come, do you?
I can't go out. Not like this.

## She part of the training?
I don't know...

## If not, firing will only give away our position to hostiles in the area. Now how smart is that?
Maybe half. Not even.

## Say again, sir?
You heard me. Move on.

## Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross. May I ask what you got it for?
For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.

## Could you have pulled that 210-pound man clear, lieutenant?
Females in combat situations impact unit cohesion. Men fight better without women around. And that is an historical fact.

## Any brothers? Sisters?
Dick, Jane, and Spot.

## Why didn't you shoot the woman, O'Neil?
Wasn't deemed a threat.

## That's not right.
She led us right to you. That's no threat?

## That's what your crew said. Are they lying? Or are you?
I think you're the liar.

## Do you?
No.

## Didn't you know you'd be raped if you were captured? Didn't you even think about that?
Sure. Just like your men do.

## Say again? How many micks?
15, sir.

## Well, who the shit you think you are? Comin' in here like that?
Your new roommate.

## Anybody usin' these drawers here?
Hey, hey, HEY. No possibility. You can't stay in here. You can't sleep right next to me.

## WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
Clear.

## North?
Sure. Now she wants to shoot.

## FLEA! KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT! Mark it, mark it! Cortez? What the hell you waiting for?
Maybe we should call the Coast Guard.

## Can't live with them, can't kill them. What's the point?
O'Neil, Jordan.

## You knew about us?
Sorry. Thought you knew I knew.

## All right. So who stands to gain if Jordan flames out in a big way?
Congress cuts, military bleeds. But Pentagon's a big place. Let's narrow the sights.

## Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first. But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?
Possibly. Just to spite DeHaven.

## The first female President?
Women.

## If you were the President, wouldn't that put a little piss in your shoes?
I don't know. Seems...

## Even tough I don't talk to her every day -- I still talk to her every day. Know what I mean?
Okay, so now work it from the other end. Think about California -- and how things might be handled there.

## I don't... What, someone on base? A \"mole\"?
That's cuz I'm married to you.

## Shut up. How can you eat like that?
Big bites.

## Who the hell are all these people?
What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.

## Where's Audrey?
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.

## What?
All that \"you gotta be vicious\" stuff you filled her head with.

## Animal, you don't think that's true, do you?
Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.

## How long where you and dis guy goin' steady?
Nearly four years...

## Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared?
Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me.

## You okay?
It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.

## Yeah. Why are you asking?
I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.

## What are you doing?
Lucy'd kill me if she knew.

## What are you doing?
It's the maintenance entrance. Runs along the side of the tunnel. When they repaired it last year I worked on a piece about it.

## Don't you think we have enough?
Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.

## Think we can fit up in there?
Only one way to find out.

## The JFK? In the rain!?
What are you talking about? The east side is always faster.

## Audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera?
No.

## Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look, wow, uh, how've you been?
It's good to see you, Nick.

## What?
You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am.

## So, you still picking apart cockroaches?
No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real \"boring\" creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises...

## You're still mad at me, aren't you?
You just left me without a phone call, a letter, nothing. All this time. Yeah, I guess I'm still a little mad.

## Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight years is a long time. Can I offer you a cup of tea?
Sure. I'd like that.

## And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
I have this theory that we're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we've done to nature.

## And you think this creature is one of them?
Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening...

## Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
I got pretty close.

## What else do you know about it?
...he's pregnant.

## Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?
You never said it was off the record.

## What are you doing here?
I thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs.

## How do you know?
He was my college sweetie! Look at him. He looks so handsome on t.v. What the hell is he doing in Panama.

## Did Romeo have a name?
Nick Tatopoulos.

## Your old sweetheart?
I left my forgery kit back at the office.

## What do I get?
The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.

## Did you talk with Humphries?
This is not the place...

## Just tell me, did you talk with him?
He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.

## Are you serious? He's going to consider me for he job? What else did he say?
Mr. Caiman, you're married.

## What?
I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...

## Not now. You got my bag?
You don't understand, I can get us information...

## Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
Listen, this is the time when the big boys have to go to work, okay Honey?

## Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos handle it?
Oh, I'm not married.

## Really? A girlfriend then?
No. Perhaps I work too much.

## You mean to tell me that there is no one who holds a special place in your heart?
Not for a long time, now.

## Oh, thank you. Is she always like this?
Hence the radiation.

## Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three million people. Has that ever been done before?
I don't think so.

## Where's Luc and Pierre?
They didn't make it.

## Christ. How many tunnels lead off the island?
Only five, Sir. We've checked them all. He hasn't used any of them.

## Well your people are getting in the way of my job.
And how should we do that, Sir?

## Major, what do you think could have done this?
Get your people out of there or I will.

## Dr. Niko Topopolosis?
It's Tatopoulos.

## Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
Follow me.

## Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl earthworm?
Yeah, you're the worm guy.

## The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means?
No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.

## What sample?
You're standing on it.

## But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? Is there?
We're hoping you're going to help us figure that out.

## What are you suggesting?
When I needed to catch earthworms, I knew the best way to catch them was not to chase them. I had to draw them out.

## You gave them the tape?
No, it's still in my tent. It's...oh my God, she took it.

## That thing's dead. What the hell are we waiting for?
Organize a search party. I want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system.

## Are you looking for this?
Thanks.

## Do I know you?
We've met before.

## Are you sure? How do you know?
We know.

## Why are you telling this to me?
I need you to trust me.

## Why do you need that?
I need your trust if you're to help me find the nest.

## How did you get all of this stuff into the country?
This is America. There is nothing you can not buy.

## So why all the secrecy? Why aren't you guys working with the US military?
I am not permitted to speak of such things.

## I am a patriot. I love my country. Can you understand that?
Sure.

## So you're in?
Are you kidding? I always wanted to join the French Foreign Legion.

## What's with the chewing gum?
Makes us look more American.

## How do I do that?
555-7600. Tell them it's a code dragonfly. They should get you through.

## What'd they say?
I can't get through. I don't know what's wrong.

## Who the hell are you?
It's okay. I know her.

## Hello?
It's Raymond.

## Where are you?
I understand.

## This is it?
Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.

## Is that the bathroom?
Come with me. I'll explain on the way.

## What's the scale? Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
Nothing.

## ~hex! Alex, are you oKav?
Not again...

## What's happened?
The engines are dead. We're drifting.

## You were holding it upside down weren't you?
Shut up.

## Oh Alex, get away from that thing...
You have a better plan, Alex?

## Dear God.... How did I come to this?
Alex you can't -just leave.

## Why didn't you stop at the market?
I still haven't got this bloody thing off.

## May I get the check?
The ships are gaining...

## Alex? Where are you going?
To see if there's a pub.

## Could they be the miners?
I don't know.

## Those blue things ate everybody here?
It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...

## He knocked me out the sonofabitch. Where is he?
Down there.

## Oh. Okay.
What?

## You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
I have sectors 1-28. I think Hector has the upper levels.

## ... Yes?
We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.

## What's your name, son?
Brandon.

## Yes...?
Okay, that's where you want to be.

## How did you come to that conclusion?
My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman. He's seen it 13 times...

## What? Up?
Berithium lava coming through. Use the handholds above you.

## I'm at the control oaneh. What do I do?
Raise the glass and push the blue button.

## That's It?
Yeah. What's wrong? JASON ~~othIno. I -ust oncuont ot wou~o oc oomooooateo onan onat.

## What's the weather like outside?
There is no weather in space.

## Computer, what about our engines? Why don't we have power?
I...Well, uh... Yes, absolutely.

## The digital conveyer? You mean I'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces?
Right.

## As good as Hopkins?
Hopkins can't drink your bathwater Fred.

## How do you remember this stuff?
Oh I make it up. Use lots of \"k\"s and \"v\"s.

## You Okay, Alex?
I don't like this... I don't like this at all...

## Maybe you're the plucky comic relief, you ever think of that?
Listen, I was wondering, would you guys mind if I sit in today? See if anybody's interested in an autograph? Never know.

## THAT'S why you built this ship?
It's ... incredible.

## Where are the miners?
Something BAD happened here.

## We should have a turbo. I'm always saying \"activate turbo boosters\", right?...
How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?

## Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
Your last name.

## Yeah, what is it?
It's... I don't know.

## Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.

## We~re oetting hammered, Jason. Return fIre?
No. Keep all energy to the armor.

## Hey, YOU want to drive?
\"Assault on Voltareck III.\" Episode... 31 I think.

## We're doing episode 31?
Whatever, the one with the hologram. The wall of fire.

## Not a clue. You?
I think he just likes pointing at things.

## How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
What do you want me to say, Gwen?... They wanted the Commander.

## What?
You smiled at me.

## Wait. When are you going to tell them?
Tell them? About...

## Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.

## Hey... Hey where are you going?
We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.

## We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
JASON...

## I thought It was the \"We're dead\" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is?
Listen, Sarris, you can't blame me for trying...

## Are they behind us?
No, I don't think so... Wait. They're not but... Something is. Oh my god.

## Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
Self control? That's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show!...

## Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
I could have held on to YOU! ...

## How does the rolling help, actually?
Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...

## What? What did he say?
Nothing. Hold please.

## Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard?
Turn on the translation circuit.

## So... We get to shut down the neutron reactor?
Right.

## This is great! They're going to start eating each other out there.
We shouldn't have to DO this! It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?

## You're kidding. When for?
Tomorrow morning, before the store opening.

## I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. GOT IT?
Sure, no problem.

## JASON You think you could-get any closer to those mines?
Closer? I can try.

## Yes... Hi Sarris... How are you doing?
Oh, right! The thing with the thing. Come on in, I'll get some pants on.

## Commander... Welcome to the Protector II. Would you like to don your uniform?
Mind If we skip that? I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys.

## Commander?... Where are you... going?
Home.

## You... You mean Earth?
Yeah. \"Earth.\" Time to get back to \"Earth,\" kids.

## Right. Long live... What's your planet?
Theramin.

## But what if Sarris survives?
NO, Thank God he has not.

## Then how did he find out about the device?
Our former Commander was not... Strong.

## Former Commander?
I'm sorry. You deserve to be shown.

## Mathesar? What is that?
It's the Tothian mine field left standing from the Great War of 12185.

## You what?.. What are you talking about?
We have seen you victorious in many more desperate situations. The fault must lie with us, with the ship...

## But...Why?
It's difficult to... On our planet we pretend in order to... entertain.

## That's right... Just keep shaking it out... Here, have some gum, It helps.
You can oc that?

## Wh... Where are we?
Twenty third quadrant of gamma sector. I can show you on a map.

## What's going on?
I think we're going to exit the space port.

## Excuse me?
They designed the ship from watching you. So... Take her out, Lieutenant...

## All right, Gwen, Alex, Fred, follow me. Guy, set up the perimeter. Tommy, you keep a lookout, make a signal if they come back.
Why don't you just turn it on and see?

## What kind of signal?
Hey I was doing okay with the pig lizard.

## Jason? What about me? What do I do?
Practice driving, Tommy.

## Commander?... Call me Laredo?
Mark 20 Into the black hole, areao.

## Continue forward, sir?
Patience, Lt. . Patience.

## Well, now there's something worth dying for. What do you think?
Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.

## And a French alliance?
Arnold!

## Well, George, who were you?
I? You all know my history.

## While they're strung out?
Same old story.

## Cut those men down. Congress is pushing ahead with your court-martial. Benedict, trust me to handle this.
Couldn't you have appealed to Congress?

## Colonel, sir, Mrs. Washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner?
Tell Mrs. Washington I am compelled to stay a while longer.

## You are never, never to touch my guns! Do you understand!?
Yes, General. But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.

## Misunderstood what!?
A lot of years have gone by.

## What? What are you talking about?
That you would have known you can trust me.

## Me? You apologizing to me?
Yes, William. I am apologizing.

## Yes, general?
Yes, general.

## Wil, I'm giving you your freedom. Do you understand?
No. I guess.

## No uniforms. No coats, even? In this weather?
No, my lord.

## And, is that a pitchfork beside him?
Many of them, many did not possess proper arms. My lord.

## Negroes? Washington has black men in his army? Are they good fighters? What's that red ribbon on his arm, Colonel?
Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons. My lord.

## By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
I, don't know what color is what officer, my lord...

## Who is that!?
I'll be twenty next year, sir.

## Excuse me, General, but may I ask how do you feel?
Therefore, retreat.

## And is that the most horrible thing in the world?
Captain, I want you to know that I respect your openness. It would make me happy if you'd join our table for dinner from now on.

## With pleasure... and an honor. Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.

## Are you going to keep him, sir?
We better, Congress invented him.

## What are we going to do?
Congress has informed the army that it is bankrupt and cannot pay the soldiers pensions.

## This is a declaration of insurrection! Who wrote this!?
No one knows...

## George, remember that night when we were drinking with Arnold?
To hell with Arnold...

## I want to address the officers, all the officers. Next Friday. Can we arrange it at the mess?
Yes, I believe so.

## Have you decided if you are going to join the Virginia Delegation to the Constitutional Convention?
I'm not sure.

## You're asking me to be president of a republic, not king? Not a dictator over subjects?
Horatio! Horatio Gates, of course you know John Adams of the Massachusetts Delegation.

## Who's in command out there?
Who the hell knows? Everyone's giving orders. It's all very democratic.

## You invented this, this...
Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went?

## Again, just to touch on a touchy subject, but... would the people accept another leader over Washington?
Partially...

## Did God ever make such a pitiful army?
These men have suffered but I believe they will fight.

## I hear General Lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in New York -- why won't he come on!?
General Lee is detained captain...

## Unofficially, General Greene.
Detained by what?

## Any word from Canada?
Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain...

## A fleet?
My God... They mean to finish us. What about Arnold? He's up there.

## A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see?
No. As a matter of fact I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.

## And, Hamilton? Greene?
They help me understand why we fight.

## What I want to know is sir, where is your daddy?
Uh... none just now, but...

## These supplies...?
Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.

## When the snow melts, mon petite Marquis, I suspect the only thing blossoming will be bright red British soldiers.
And how rusty are these muskets?

## What is it, Marquis?
My baby daughter has died... my baby... mon petite Henriette...

## My God, what?
The eternal dream of the disenfranchised, my dear, a classless world. Not a very real expectation.

## And, what 'prize' do you see? What could we possible gain?
But, as usual, it will not go well for... them. Martha, you must trust me.

## When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
That's when Sally Fairfax was tutoring you...

## Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a law in Virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church?
Well, I wouldn't want to trouble you with this now.

## Martha... what?
To win this war I need an army.

## What's the point of a revolution if it doesn't?
Some things must never change.

## I... I'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army, sir.
We can't take them. Are you all right?

## It isn't my army yet, Colonel Greene. Looks like you've seen some action -- did you hurt your leg, in a fight?
I was born with a limp, sir. The Militia used to hate it when I marches with them because my pike would always sway...

## But, you do come from a military family?
I have commanded the Rhode Island Militia for a year now. My father is an ironmaster. As was I.

## A horseshoer?
Well sir, I was an ironmaster before you got me. Maybe I will let you down yet.

## General Greene?
I'm with Captain Hamilton.

## You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?
I will not betray you, Nathanael.

## Sir, I have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform...
What the hell are we doing?

## I'd throw everything away for you.
That's a lie!

## You remember, George, when we were 'studying' the great philosophers?
I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.

## Except for that, quite like home; England, that is.
Really? Which precious homily was it?

## Where... do those men come from, George?
Africa, of course.

## Africa? That's so far? How do they get here?
Slavers capture them and bring them here.

## What do you really think of the minuet, anyway?
It's stupid, of course.

## Then why are you teaching me...?
Perhaps you best ask, why you wish it. You asked William to teach you manners, philosophy, decorum... as I said, it's completely stupid.

## Those people? I doubt they'd think of this. Ooo, you're wonderful this color!
What are you doing?

## That's good... who?
Voltaire, of course...

## You hear that?
That? I hear a mob, unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs.

## Don't be silly, you have whole worlds to fathom.
Is that your test of patriotism, George; if a man will die for you?

## What is this?
An Oldsmobile Silhouette.

## You're kidding me, right?
Hey, you want La Tierra Rent-A-Car just over there, but I think all they got are Rabbit convertibles.

## You see that? The way the man just went right over?
Cat, that's the lamest idea I've ever heard.

## So where's the money?
I guess still in the locker.

## You guess? You mean you don't know?
I mean I don't care.

## You see the paper?
I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot.

## Whoa... This is the man used to jump offa high buildings?
Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat. I'm done.

## And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then?
Just do what I told you and meet me back here at midnight.

## No. What's this?
Plan B. Here ya go, honey...

## Trade for what?
The money. Fuck. I gotta think...

## Hell, why not just shoot her? Why not shoot everybody. Fuckin' shoot me. Shoot the fuckin' president?
Don't fade on me now, Bear. Not unless you wanna hold Farrah on your lap in a room fulla felons.

## What, did you see it work in some movie you got beat up in?
I have to ask you for that key.

## What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.

## How 'bout when you went down the stairs?
I think I pulled my quadriceps.

## So... how many movies you been in?
About sixty.

## Yayo. Where is he?
Sure. Family. I know how that goes.

## You gave him the money?
I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.

## Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?
Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.

## Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?
He's around someplace.

## What's this movie you're doing first?
Harry, let me answer that.

## But first I want to know who I'm talking to. Am I talking to you, or am I talking to him?
You can talk to me.

## No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?
I put a gun right here... ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.

## I missed that one. Or, hey, you know who else? Morgan Freeman. You know Morgan?
Yeah, Morgan Freeman. But he's a colored guy.

## What about her?
Get something going there.

## With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?
She's... young.

## Young? She's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as Lovejoy's kid. Bernie. One she calls Bernard. Have you read the script?
Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores.

## Who?
She's been out of movies a few years, but she's good. Real good.

## That's all there is to it, huh?
That's all.

## What money?
The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.

## Lemme see if I got this right, you break into Karen Flores' house, ask me for three hundred grand, doesn't even belong to you?
I can't believe the way you guys do business out here. I can't believe how fucked up your organization is.

## What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
In just a second. Two...

## Karen? You okay?
She can't talk right now.

## You know Laurel Canyon?
I'll find it.

## In the can. That the money?
She's great. Gimme the money.

## What?
Only this time, no John Wayne and Dean Martin shooting the bad guys in El Dorado.

## You positive about that?
I'm working on a few things.

## Boy, this town. Word gets around, doesn't it?
Last night. When he called me over to your office to talk about it.

## Chili Palmer showed you my script?
Yeah, I was wondering why he should do that.

## You serious?
All I want in return is to work on the movie with you. Fact I already got some ideas on how to fix it up.

## You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
We'll talk about that, Harry. But first I gotta know, how'd you hook up with Chili Palmer.

## He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer. So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him?
Leo, I don't know.

## Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred?
The airport.

## I can hear you, but where the fuck are you, man?
What I been wondering is where's he been.

## What three hundred grand?
The three hundred grand a guy named Leo Devoe scammed off an airline. The three hundred grand Chili Palmer now has in his possession.

## Hello? You there?
Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real.

## Who?
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.

## So, what, this Zimm guy asking for some kinda finders fee, that what we're talking about here?
Hey, Zimm doesn't ask for dick. Zimm tells you the way it is... or else.

## Or else what?
Or else use your fucking imagination.

## Where's Leo Devoe? Where's Chili Palmer? Where's my fuckin' money?
Ray. Look at me.

## What?
Look at me, Ray.

## You say look at you?
That's correct. Look at me.

## How'd you get in here?
I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me.

## So what brings you to L.A., Bones?
Don't insult me. Get up and turn around.

## Why would I do that?
Cause the guy's a customer now, stupid. His ass belongs to me.

## Yeah? Which terminal?
Sovereign.

## You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go. Why haven't you left?
I like it here.

## Who the fuck are you?
Ray Barboni. From Miami.

## What, like that's supposed to mean something to me?
The man you're steppin' on belongs to me and my partner.

## You live in Miami?
That's right.

## What're you doing in Los Angeles?
I'm in the movie business.

## You're an investor, is that it?
I'm a producer.

## You have a card in here?
Not yet. I just started.

## Your wife a Lakers fan?
I am. I'm a fan of everything that's L.A. I love it out here.

## It was C... I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking for anyway, a bomb or something?
Something shouldn't be there.

## Leo spanked a waitress?
Hey, Chil? Since you're goin' out to L.A. anyway.

## What've you got?
Guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand, sixty days over; a movie producer.

## Where you been, Harry?
Have we met? I don't recall.

## Did you stop to think what if I had a heart attack?
You look okay to me, Harry. Come over here and sit down. Tell me what you been up to.

## I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
That's what I'm doing.

## Operator, how do I get Las Vegas Information?
Harry, lemme give you some advice.

## Why do I have to keep looking at you?
I want you to.

## You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
Fuckin' basketball game.

## You make movies, huh?
Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores.

## Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing?
You want to hear this idea? It's about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand. Go on, tell her.

## That's it? That's your movie?
I said I had an idea, that's all.

## You mean, Leo?
You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.

## But you work for the casino?
I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen.

## Is that right, that's what you do for a living?
What I did till recently. After I get done here I'll think about what I'm gonna do next.

## You pack a gun?
Not really.

## What does that mean?
Maybe a few times I have.

## Really? You ever been arrested?
I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean.

## Harry, look at me.
Racketeering, that covers a lot of ground, doesn't it?

## You got that on the brain, Harry. If you're so scared of 'em why'd you take their money to Vegas to begin with?
Because I need half a million to buy a script.

## For a movie?
A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my \"Driving Miss Daisy\".

## What's it called?
\"Mr. Lovejoy\".

## \"Mr. Lovejoy\"? That's the title?
It's not bad when you know what it's about.

## Who's the star?
Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir.

## He drown?
Heart attack. Apparently they brought a couple hookers along.

## What do you get out of this?
Let's see how we get along.

## How's anyone gonna see anything from way up there?
Hey, Harry.

## Is he giving you a check or cash?
Cash. It happens to be waiting right at this moment in a locker at the airport.

## A meeting with who? You and Karen?
I found him.

## You have it?
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.

## Who?
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.

## You cut straight hair in this place, or just fags?
Hey, Bones, looks like you're gonna have a nice scar up there. Maybe these guys can fit you with a rug, cover it up for ya.

## How'd you know he died, he tell you?
Yeah, he told me.

## Personally?
Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.

## What Get Away jet?
It was in the Herald.

## We talk different?
You mean like we don't give a shit.

## One of mine?
One we're producing.

## With what? Wiseguy money?
Martin, I'm not connected to those people anymore. Not since I walked out of a loanshark Operation in Miami.

## What happened? The pressure got to you?
Pressure? I'm the one applied the pressure.

## Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do?
Martin, look at me.

## Wait. How about this?
Now you're squinting like you need glasses.

## How about this?
That's not bad.

## How do I know that?
The wife sues the airline. This is a gutsy babe.

## So when do I meet up with the husband and give him the look?
Okay. I'm listening.

## You're not going to tell me the rest?
Lemme talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.

## Buddy?
Very nice...

## What's that?
Compass.

## Whatta you think, Chill?
That's not bad. I think you got it down.

## You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
They report it to the IRS.

## Who told you that?
Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.

## How'd you know I was here?
Here's another tip...

## It was Fay, wasn't it, told you about the money. She tell you my whole life history, for Christ's sake?
I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.

## How? By taking my money?
You can keep what you won today. That's yours.

## You take all my money, but you're borrowing part of it?
At eighteen percent, okay? And don't ask me no more fuckin' questions. I'm leaving.

## It's not one of these?
You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.

## Maybe you don't see my sign?
We call you a taxi.

## You broke in?
No, it was open. It wasn't locked.

## What if it was?
Well, basically, this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand, plus he's a few weeks behind on the vig, the interest you have to pay.

## The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?
That's right. Three percent.

## What're you doing here?
I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night.

## Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before?
No, no... you left the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here.

## Like in \"Bride of the Mutant\", when you played the whole end with that torn top.
Rough day on the set?

## You saw that one?
I married Martin. That was a full- time job.

## That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
Harry told me Martin loves it, he flipped.

## You been here the whole time?
I just caught the end.

## What do you think?
I think it's not horrible.

## Then you've read it?
Not yet.

## There a part in it for you?
I don't want to act in it, I want to produce it with Harry. Especially if I help him get Martin.

## That why you came over here, to ask me that?
I want to know.

## Why does anyone want to be in movies?
Yesterday, you were a loan shark.

## And you think the movie business is any different?
This thing's actually accurate. I bought it for ten bucks from a kid in a lawn chair on Sunset...

## Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.

## You don't like Martin much, do you?
Oh, I like him. I just think he's... short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty.

## So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.

## Yeah?
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.

## You thought I was faking?
No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.

## You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?
Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.

## What kinda food they serve at this Ivy place anyway?
Continental, but it doesn't matter. Martin won't order from the menu.

## Why not?
Because a movie star can never order straight from the menu. They have to think of something they have to have that isn't on the menu.

## You sure?
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.

## Are you going down?
I don't know.

## You okay?
Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.

## Were you scared up there?
You bet.

## I was scared then, not now. How long you want me to be scared?
I'll be right back.

## What took you so long?
Couldn't find my toothbrush.

## They're closing the Granview. You know, theater down on Biscayne?
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.

## You sure it was Ray Bones took the coat?
That's what the guy said.

## That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?
In an armchair. Or I go to a coffee shop, sleep there. Sit in a booth, pull my hat down.

## How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
He already knew it.

## Whatta you doing out there?
I'm going into the movie business.

## What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
I'm thinking about producing.

## Yeah, but whose point of view?
Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.

## Get down here. I wanna talk to you. Come on... right now... She's gonna talk to Martin?
All these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene.

## Yeah? What three words, Harry?
Pick 'n' Save.

## Hm?
You heard me, Pick 'n' Save.

## Well, aren't you gonna offer me whatever it is you taste like?
Come on in.

## Yeah, lovely. Last night I watched two guys carjack a Camaro down on the corner of Argyle there. What do you want, Doris?
I miss Murray, Harry.

## Yeah, what'd he have to say?
He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.

## What's wrong?
Be quiet and listen.

## Harry, are you going down, or you want me to?
Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.

## How did you get in the house?
He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far. Sit down, have a drink. Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks.

## With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry?
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.

## Harry, what're you still doing with those guys?
He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand, no strings, I write any kind of agreement I want.

## Shylock?
Karen. Wow. Look at you...

## Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away?
It' didn't slip away, Martin, you did... when you went off to fuck Nicki in the middle of my birthday party.

## But you are interested?
Hi, sweetface. You look great. And mmmmm, you smell good, too.

## Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. What type of vessel?
A passenger liner. Over.

## Hypothetically speaking, what if we get this boat to Sitka and find out somebody wants it back?
They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.

## You think the extra strain caused it?
Nah. Everything was cool. It's just one of those things.

## How about now?
Sixty pounds.

## What? You sure?
That's what it says.

## Looks like it took out the backup genny too.
Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. You don't think that's just a little freaky?

## What's so great about Sweden?
It's a beautiful country. Very clean. Very civilized. And cold.

## I don't know. Tuesday?
Wrong. It's Friday.

## Lemme see, was that before or after the oil fire?
You'd think on a ship this size there'd be something left to eat.

## Where from?
Amidships starboard at the beam. Just under the waterline. I don't think it's a problem.

## One more?
Why not.

## What?
It just occurred to me I don't know your first name. All this time and I don't know it.

## What?
Maureen.

## Maureen?
Roger.

## Roger?
Yeah.

## Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?
Somebody's probably looking for her as we speak.

## Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds, it ain't gonna be what you'd call easy. Any questions?
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.

## Ready?
Bring it on, dude.

## Ever heard of insurance, big boy?
I tell you one thing, we're not gonna be towing no ship now.

## What're you crazy?
I like my job.

## So we kill him?
I'm saying we gotta do whatever we gotta do to preserve our interest.

## Pretty handy with that scatter gun, Epps. You raised on a farm?
Seen a lota movies.

## Smokes?
Oh yeah.

## A what?
I heard a scream. When I got there I found him on the floor. He was having some kind of seizure. I didn't see anybody else.

## Then what the hell happened to him?
Try Wednesday.

## Why not?
Dodge. Dodge.

## What?
Get up.

## You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?
Threw a turbine blade.

## How long to fix?
Hard to say. I gotta get in there and have a look. At least a couple days. Depending.

## What's this?
Turbine rotor's shot.

## The right way and the wrong way.
How much longer's that gonna take?

## But how long?
Hard to say.

## What about running number two by itself?
It's a full 2500 horses down. We couldn't drag that boat down hill on ice with it.

## How long, then?
I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .

## How long?
Three, four days.

## She take a radio?
It's a hell of a lot of money.

## A ship with fifty million dollars in gold aboard, adrift? And nobody seems to care enough to come looking for it?
Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.

## So what're we gonna do. That's the big question, right?
A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.

## You gotta be kidding? What the hell we need that tub for, we got fifty million bucks?
So we get a little more for the boat. Besides, the gold'll be safer where it is.

## How about you Epps?
Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be doing if we don't get this boat running.

## What if that fucker finds it before we're ready to go?
We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight off. Low man first.

## Can't you use something else?
I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.

## What is it?
I think you better see this for yourself.

## It was a man's voice. Repeating some sort of children's rhyme. I don't know, it didn't make any sense. You didn't hear it?
Not me.

## On a passenger ship in 1953?
If they knew what they were carrying.

## How do you mean?
Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.

## What do you propose?
You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.

## I didn't touch the fucking radio! Ever occur to you there's somebody else on that boat, skipper?
Conveniently enough for you.

## Look, I didn't touch it. Alright?
Yeah.

## What's slow?
Maybe twenty gallons an hour.

## Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.

## That's a good thing?
Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder the better.

## What'd he look like?
Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get a good look. He was far away. But I saw him. I saw him as sure as you're standing there.

## Any dizziness?
No.

## Lights?
Sudden flashes of light.

## You okay?
Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.

## What?
Nothing. Let's get outa here.

## Candy?
It's my pen name.

## Coffee?
Yeah. Thanks.

## What'd you find up there?
Some charts. A crew manifest. Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.

## She was sailing up north, right?
Her destination was Halifax, yeah.

## Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?
Nope.

## So what did happen?
Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure.

## You think she's sailing without a crew?
I think we'd be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current.

## Why not call for help?
For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.

## Who?
The guy. He just came this way.

## What guy?
There's somebody else on this boat.

## Are you sure?
Of course I'm sure. I saw him.

## You sure it wasn't me?
It wasn't you. It was somebody else. There's somebody else aboard.

## No cowboy shit up there, understand?
No cowboy shit. Right.

## Got your light?
Yup.

## You just shoot at something?
Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird.

## Greer?
I don't know. No. Not Greer. Somebody.

## Same. Any luck?
No. I'll try again later.

## You're saying they mutinied for the gold?
If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.

## What?
Somebody took it out of commission last night.

## Collision? With what?
The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.

## But where's the damage?
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.

## I don't know, are we?
When you found me yesterday, at the pool. I'd seen... something. Someone.

## What, like some kind of ghost?
I don't know what else you'd call her. One second she was there, the next she was gone.

## Showing you what?
What happened.

## Victims of what?
Something bad happened here, Murphy.

## What's that supposed to mean?
I don't know.

## Why you? How come the rest of us haven't seen these people?
Just lucky I guess.

## Either of you seen Dodge?
Nope.

## Epps? You there?
Right here.

## What do we do with him?
Leave him till we can get some help. From now on, nobody comes down here.

## It's not the weather I'm worried about. The wrong current could drag us as far as the Aleutians before we come across another boat.
What do you think?

## What happened?
We hit land.

## What?
We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.

## And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
I didn't want it to turn out this way.

## Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
I think I see it pretty well.

## What do you say, Dodge?
Not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to Russia.

## Call the Coastguard?
Steer to one eight five. Let's check her out.

## How's that?
Besides a little rust, everything's pretty well-preserved.

## Some classy tub in it's day, huh?
Yeah.

## How much you figure that's worth, skipper?
Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.

## So what? We gonna unload the gold and get a move on?
We leave it where it is. Stick to the plan.

## What now?
We could call for help.

## Fifty million four ways. That's twelve million and change a piece. What you gonna do with your share, skipper?
Not much at all, I guess. Retire. Live out my golden years and all that.

## Greer?
Moving to Sweden.

## Supposing he wants to get bad with us?
I say we off-load some of that gold now.

## How're you feeling?
Lost my sea legs.

## You don't remember?
Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.

## Say what?
Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.

## We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
I wish I could tell you. I'd be real interested to know myself.

## Must be a little too the truth, eh Dodge?
It's a Noaa buoy.

## A what?
Government weather. It's got a transmitter aboard.

## What about the gold?
Leave it.

## You think whoever did this is reasonable?
All I'm saying is that gold's worth a lot more to us now than it ever was.

## What seems to be the trouble, ladies?
Whyn't you mind your own business, chief.

## Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you got your hearing aid turned down?
I heard you. But I'm choosing to ignore you. Epps, let's go.

## Or what?
I thought you say Tuesday.

## What's this?
You got a leak in the number nine compartment.

## You're kidding, right?
You want fair pay, make hamburger for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to sign.

## Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
Not if I don't find that goddamn spatula.

## Will you get off my back for once?
It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.

## Who?
Guess.

## How should I know?
Someone from the past.

## Give up?
YES.

## Not the Maxine?
Yup.

## I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
I-I really have to get up early for class tomorrow.

## Are you still looking for a job?
I guess.

## Pumpkin? What's wrong?
Nothing.

## About what?
Yeah, I heard about that.

## What do you mean \"on his way up\"!?
I just buzzed him in.

## Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!

## Really? I never really cared for those. Why does the fat one always have to be so mean to the skinny one?
Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess I'm a little early...

## What are you trying to say?
It's just that I feel like it's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out.

## Who is this, Enid?
It's supposed to be Don Knotts.

## And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.

## And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?
It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something...

## Enid, can I talk to you for a minute?
Uh-oh.

## Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year?
I'm not really sure - working, I guess...

## I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff?
Well, yes...

## Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?
I didn't check my messages...

## Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?
But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.

## What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of \"frozen yogurt\"?
Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.

## Aren't there a million places like this?
This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.

## So, where's \"Weird Al\"?
SHH! He's back there. I can see his hair bobbing up and down.

## Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives?
No.

## Are you the one who left that note?
I guess.

## Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
Yeah, right...

## \"Yeah, right\"... well why not? What's so wrong with me?
Nothing.

## When did I say I hated you?
You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.

## Why do you have that stupid poster?
Oh, hi...

## How long have you been up?
I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird...

## Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?
I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this.

## Hey Josh.
Why not?

## Are you ready to go?
You loser.

## What? Why?
Forget it...

## Since when is she an \"actress\"?
I know, she needs to die immediately.

## Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh?
How perfect.

## So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment?
Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.

## Did you sign up yet?
Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest.

## What do you do if you're a satanist, anyway?
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...

## \"Authentic 50's diner\"? Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's?
God, it's so totally pathetic.

## Can we call you \"Weird Al\"?
Check out the Personals... maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us.

## Does Oomie really like this show?
Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.

## So what should we do?
Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.

## Hey - why do you have this?
You lent it to me in like tenth grade.

## I bet! Actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with -- you always go for guys with some lame, fake shtick.
I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?

## Which loser?
You know, the green cardigan guy.

## Why do I always have to do it?
I dunno...

## He doesn't even look that bummed out, really.
Are you sure?

## I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
Come on, it's too late now...

## What about the \"striking redhead in the yellow dress\"?
Oh yeah...

## What are you talking about?
You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.

## I bet they have tons of incredible shoes hidden in the back.
What? How long have you been standing there?

## Where are we going?
Let's go hassle Josh.

## \"Hassle\"?
There he is...

## Should we leave a note?
Why are we going here? I hate this place.

## How about this one?
Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm.

## Ew ... when did you get that?
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.

## How about this?
Forget it. I'm sure it sucks. All these movies suck.

## If I promise you there's really a party with a lot of guys, do you promise you'll go?
Just now... I went with Seymour.

## God, how can you stand all these assholes?
I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.

## Yeah, well... So when are you going to get your job?
I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time.

## Like what?
Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.

## Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!
You're gross. See that guy?

## Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
...maybe we should be lesbos...

## When are you finally going to get your diploma?
I dunno, but next week is my last class...

## Oh yeah right, like I'm gonna let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus.
Wasn't it like eighth grade?

## Now are you going to get a regular job?
Don't worry.

## Do you want to do something tonight?
I can't, it's Seymour's birthday... Shit! What time is it? I have to go to the store! I was going to make him a cake...

## Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?
Yeah, I guess... call me...

## Don't you want nice stuff?
I can't imagine spending money on towels.

## What thing?
That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy.

## So should I come over?
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...

## What are you talking about? Who?
Just some people from work...

## Why? What did he say?
Nothing.

## When was this?
I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes.

## What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?
I need to talk to you.

## So, whaddya think?
It's fine.

## So where's all your stuff?
There.

## That's all you're bringing?
I'm gonna finish packing tonight... I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.

## What time?
I dunno...

## Do you want anything?
Maybe an orange juice.

## We're not.
What about me? Am I not even here?

## Really? Both of you?... Why not?
Just because.

## What are you going to be when you grow up, Todd?
Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.

## So what are you guys doing this Summer?
My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break.

## Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
May I ask what you're doing?

## How much is this?
Umm... That's not officially for sale... I might have to hang onto that for the time being.

## Do you have any other old records besides these?
Seymour does.

## Who does?
Him. Seymour. He's the man with the records.

## You still interested in that?
I thought it wasn't for sale.

## Hi... what's your name?
Norman.

## ...are you waiting for a bus?
Yes.

## Did you bring that tape?
You never paid me for that tape with the Indian dance routine.

## Hey, where are you going?
Later, \"Dude\".

## What?
Five hundred.

## Well why do I care about that?
Sure!... Wait, maybe not 78s, but I can play regular records...

## There's some good stuff in here... do you like old music?
Sure, I guess.

## You're right about that. So this is your record collection?
Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.

## Really? Can I see it?
Yeah, well sure... you can if you want to... it's just I don't want all these guys in there at once... you know...

## Oh, come on! What are you talking about?
I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...

## But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?
I really didn't get a good look at her.

## C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect data here! Don't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl?
I'm just not one of those guys who has a \"type\"...

## Maybe I don't want to meet someone who shares my interests. I hate my interests! Where can I go to meet the exact opposite of myself?
Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance.

## So is that your boyfriend?
Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.

## Please, Seymour... Becky and I have been dying to go in here but we can't get any boys to take us... Please?
These are older women just dressed up to look young... I think.

## C'mon, Seymour, please?
Relax, Seymour, relax...

## I'm not holding my breath in that department.
So, why did you bring this along?

## What are we, in slow motion here?! What are ya, hypnotized? Have some more kids, why don't you?... For Christ's sake, would you move!?
Jesus, Seymour.

## Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?
Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I gotta think of something to talk to her about. No! No...

## What did you tell that girl?
I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.

## If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not?
I dunno... because I can't stand the idea of a world where a guy like you can't get a date...

## What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?
What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.

## \"Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS\"!
What, are you a klansman or something?

## You work at Cook's Chicken?
For nineteen years...

## What are you, a fry cook or something?
Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.

## What? Why?
You can open your eyes now.

## Are you okay?
It's just my stupid back. I'll be all right in a minute...

## What is that?
Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...

## What, like a girdle?
Never...

## Never mind, it's way too complicated... Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?
I won't even dignify that with a response.

## Aren't you going to get that?
Let the machine get it. I have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me...

## Wow! What was that all about?
It's just somebody's idea of a joke...

## That didn't sound like a joke to me... what, did you write a personal ad or something?
Hi, it's me...

## So, what happened?
Actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think everything's going pretty well...

## Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you...
What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?

## No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore?
I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...

## Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...

## So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?
Sounds good...

## ...so... is he your boyfriend now?
It's just that, well, you know, Dana just got out of a really bad relationship and I don't want to give her the wrong idea... you know...

## What's her problem anyway? Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...

## What does she mean by that - \"somebody like me\"?
Just someone so young...

## Does that mean you don't like me?
No, of course not.

## In what way do you mean?
In whatever way you think I mean.

## ...What do you mean?
Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother you any more.

## What are you doing here?
I had to see you.

## Can you at least let me in?
Uh... sure... come in.

## Do you have anything to drink?
Uh... I think there's some root beer...

## I could never move - I've got too much stuff.
What about this?

## I hate sports.
Where did you get this?

## How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?
Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.

## I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?
Yeah, sure. Of course.

## What about Joe?
Yeah, well I like you too...

## What?
I dunno, I...

## What do you want?
What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...

## You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?
They're Seymour's.

## Still torturing yourself over that Enid, huh?
Where else am I ever going to find another girl who likes Geeshie Wiley records? She could at least have the decency to call me back.

## Please Josh?
Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse.

## I wish I could see him.
So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us?

## Did you remember to pay the phone bill?
Yeah.

## What do we have here, Margaret?
It's a tampon in a teacup...

## I can see that... now what can you tell us about it? First of all, what kind of sculpture is this?
It's a \"found object\"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art.

## Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?
No... they said she was here...

## Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
I don't know.

## Why? What did she tell you?
She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...

## What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.

## Did she say that?
Look, what do you expect? Considering how we met you.

## What do you mean?
On that pathetic fake blind date.

## What are you talking about?
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...

## What fake blind date? What are you talking about?
I have to admit, things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit.

## So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?
Well, mostly archival research, cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their CD reissues. It's really... I can't believe it.

## Why don't we start with that next week?
Thank you, doctor.

## Let me see the sick.
Seymour?

## Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
There is no reason for fear.

## Am I to take it you want to live?
Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.

## -build the bridge over the Tsavo river. And be finished in four months time. Can you do that?
I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge.

## Pleasant journey?
How could it be? I hate Africa.

## So work must be going well?
Truthfully? There has been the occasional odd hiccup- but then, as you so wisely told me, I'd never built in Africa.

## But overall, you're pleased?
I do need to see Starling.

## Awhile back he ordered some bibles- -I've brought them. Is he here?
It hasn't been that simple so far.

## Are you running a high fever, man? How could you expect something as lunatic as this to succeed? How could you even conceive of it?
I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger.

## And it worked?
In point of fact, it didn't. But I'm convinced the theory is sound.

## What?
I made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job.

## Then why do you stay?
Who else would hire me? Beat you to it, didn't I? Oh yes, almost forgot- brought you a little welcoming gift.

## I know it's your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey- -but what are you going to do about it?
Karim will have to show me where it happened. And of course, I'll need the donkey. With any luck, I'll sort it out tonight.

## Then why do it?
You never had it.

## A man-eater attacks and you're such a buffoon you almost forget to mention it?
-then he feasted on him, starting with his feet-

## Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?
I have been desperate for Patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived.

## Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?
It was embarrassing- the man showered me with compliments.

## Anything special about them?
Just that they fart through their mouths. Must make kissing something of a gamble.

## I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
Almost three hours. But I've been getting ready all my life.

## Have you got that in writing?
Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts.

## Excellent. Could I see the bridge site?
I've got medical supplies to deliver. Come along to the hospital when you're done.

## And anxious to get started. What is this, mostly malaria?
Yes- but their suffering is only transitory- once they except God into their hearts, He will vanquish all pain.

## You said \"of course\" you'd need the donkey. Why \"of course\"?
I don't suppose I could watch.

## I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?
Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse than you think- I've never even seen one.

## But it's crazy- the lion shouldn't be that hungry this soon. Samuel?
What a good week.

## You mean nobody died?
I didn't have a chance to thank you.

## What did I do?
Got me out of trouble.

## Have you got it?
No, but you do- -see, you were needed after all. And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn.

## Has it ever done that before?
...don't know...

## Have you ever failed?
Only in life...

## What happened to them?
I got big.

## Their den? Have you ever seen anything like this?
Nobody's seen anything like this. Lions don't have caves like this- -they're doing it for pleasure.

## Where could it have gone? How could it get across the water? They're only lions, yes?
Don't they have to be?...

## Yes. And I'll be in some distant tree where I can provide no assistance whatsoever. Can you control your fear?
I'll have to.

## Was that supposed to make me feel better?
It's certainly the best chance they've had to kill you.

## You think they'll come then? Why?
Good luck.

## Why?
Because I think they're after you.

## The most of any lions... a hundred...? Probably more. Johnny...?
I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad you came.

## Why do the workers look unhappy?
Because they are here. Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world. Come, John- to the bridge.

## I am also liaison between these two.
Did it look like this in your mind?

## What are they looking at?
You- they cannot believe you're still here.

## Good news?
I expect so- it's from my wife.

## Do you love her?
I do, actually; very much.

## You like him, don't you?
Oh yes. But it takes time.

## You've known him long?
Since his beard was red.

## Thank you. Why does he need you by him?
He doesn't. He needs nobody. But we have hunted many times... ...he knows I am afraid of lions...

## He has children?
Once...

## Where is it?
I don't believe you had a mother.

## How many cattle?
Four should do it.

## Why so many?
Because I have two plans to kill the lions- one involving the cattle, the other the men.

## Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
Help finish the railroad.

## We'll be very sorry to lose you. Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
Actually, I'm not eating lunch today. I have an appointment. In fact, I'd better go.

## Every day I ask you, and every day you've got something else to do. Do I have bad breath or something?
I'm sorry. Perhaps some other time.

## Do you need anything? You want me to come in?
No, everything's fine. Honestly. Thanks anyway.

## Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
Oh, I'm sorry. This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.

## What do you want with my baby?
If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.

## What are you working on, Egon?
We'll do the happiness index next. I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you.

## How is he these days?
Venkman? I think he was borderline for a while there. Then he crossed the border.

## Does he ever mention me?
No. Not that I can recall.

## This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me?
Certainly.

## Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?
I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett. I'm a building superintendent.

## Hiya, Oscar. What do you say, slugger?
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.

## Didn't I do it?
No, you didn't, Frank.

## You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first. I'm still into all this stuff, you know. Haven't you ever seen my show?
I have. That's why I didn't call you first.

## What do you think?
His name is Oscar.

## You are personally responsible. If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
Please don't say that. You won't go to prison.

## You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
I'm El Gato. I always land on my feet.

## So this is what you do, huh?
Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar.

## Who could blame him? Were you wearing this nightgown?
I don't know what to do anymore.

## Peter, what about the bathtub?
We'll take care of that. Ray, Pete. Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.

## Really? And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
Now you get dressed and we go out. I got a babysitter and everything. Trust me, you need it.

## Does she know anything about babies?
Okay, but it's not a date. It's a dinner.

## Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
I put them in your hamper. I thought they were dirty.

## So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions?
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.

## All right, you want to be real? So tell me why did you dump me?
Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you. I just had to protect myself. You really weren't very good for me, you know.

## So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
Let me jingle you right now.

## Finally came to your senses, huh?
That's not true. It was 1620.

## Is this the spot?
A little to the left. Right there! That's where it stopped.

## Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?
It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn. I can't be sure, Peter.

## Can I help you?
Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.

## I'm Jack Hardemeyer. I'm the mayor's assistant. What can I do for you?
I'm an old friend of the mayor's. I just want to say hello to him.

## Before you go running to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown?
Now you're talking.

## What is it, honey?
It's that darn ghost again! I don't know what to do anymore. He just won't leave us alone. I guess we'll just have to move.

## Who are you going to call?
Ghostbusters.

## What are you doing up here?
I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out. I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.

## Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls in sick or gets hurt.

## I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit. Do you want to babysit with me?
Oh, sure, that sounds great.

## You're really good with children, Louis. I can tell. Why don't you come here and sit with me?
Okay.

## Should we go?
I don't think we should leave her alone.

## I'm not sure this is such a good idea? Do they know you're doing this?
Oh, yeah, sure -- no. But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.

## How are you? What's that you're working on, Johnny?
We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr. Venkman.

## Then why have you come?
We got a major creep alert and we're just going down the list. Your name was first.

## You know, I never got to ask you. Where you from, Johnny?
The Upper West Side.

## So you see, everything is in order, is it not?
Not. Don't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities. We'll be back.

## Your honor, may I approach the bench?
Yes.

## Get on with it, counselor!
Can I have some of your water?

## Did I forget something?
Come on, Sherm. You're my cousin. Do this for me. I'm begging you.

## Like what?
I got you out of those bad tax shelters.

## I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?
Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year. Forget it, Louis. I could get in a lot of trouble.

## Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?
I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.

## Well, for your sake, I hope you're right. But I think my other guest may disagree with you. Elaine, you had another date in mind?
Yes, I did. We were city champs.

## So what are you saying? That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.

## How've you been? How's teaching? I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?
I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.

## Boys, listen. You're scaring the straights. Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?
This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman. It's hot and it's ready to pop.

## Pretty impressive, huh?
It's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country.

## From where -- Neptune?
They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.

## Some crank. Looking for goat hooves. Come up with anything?
You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.

## Why don't we try the Giga-meter?
The New York Pneumatic Railway. It was an experimental subway system. Fan-forced air-trains, built around 1870.

## We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
What's the reading?

## You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
There's definitely something going on in that studio. The PKE levels were max-plus and the Giga-meter was showing all red.

## Is the line sinking?
No, the slime is rising.

## Nowhere -- fast. Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
Uh, I can't. I'm kind of working on something.

## Great. So what are you guys working on?
It's an interesting one, Pete. If anything was going on it's totally subdued now.

## What's that?
Egon and I have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs - giga electron volts.

## Hold on, Ray! Half-price! Have you gone crazy?
I guess so, Pete, because that's not all. Tell them what else we've got, Egon.

## You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?
If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.

## And now you're going to eat it?
No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.

## This is what you do with your spare time?
This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance! Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.

## I'll get one more reading.
What kind of tests?

## What happened?
You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.

## Don't tell me, let me guess. All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?
Darn it! I wish I'd known you were going. I'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations.

## Good effort. Now what? Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?
I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.

## Only one way to find out. Ready, Teddy?
I'll keep to the middle of the channel. We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go ashore and take First Avenue to 79th.

## I think she looks pretty good here, don't you?
Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.

## Ready?
I'm ready.

## Does it have any favorites?
It likes all the sappy stuff, 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.

## You finished here?
What? Yeah.

## Are you all right? You coming down with something?
No, I'm fine. I just got light-headed for a second there. Let's go.

## Nice going, Ray! What were you trying to do -- drown me?
Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.

## Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?
Groovy. I've never felt better in my life.

## And decent.
You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?

## Wonder what?
If she's naked under that toga. She's French, you know.

## Aren't you glad we waited?
It is a star! That's great. You're very good.

## Incredible! Five for five. You're not cheating on me here, are you?
No. They're just coming to me.

## Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
Definitely. I think you may be a very gifted telepath.

## ... I thought it was the drug store.
Eight o'clock?

## Are you sick, Louis?
No thanks, Louis. I'm really tired. I've been rehearsing all morning.

## Are you the Gatekeeper?
I am Zuul.

## Hello. I'm Peter Venkman. May I help you?
Yes ... well ... I'm not sure. What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.

## Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
Some people like the attention. Some people are just crazy.

## Is that your professional opinion?
It's in the stars.

## Have you ever thought of moving out -- at least until this disturbance blows over?
No. If I moved out now I'd be acknowledging that what happened was real. I'm not ready to do that.

## Really? Do you have a favorite piece?
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.

## No? What do I act like?
Like a used car salesman.

## Thanks. What's in there?
That's too bad.

## Nothing. Is that the kitchen?
Yeah, yeah.

## All right. What do you want to do?
I think I should spend the night here.

## No kiss?
Great rehearsal.

## You heard it?
You're the best one in your row.

## Who's the stiff?
The \"stiff?\" He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man.

## He is a very close friend. Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment?
Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.

## Can't you tell me now?
You must have gotten the last copy.

## I've got to go now.
Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?

## Hey, Dana. What is it? What happened?
I am Zuul. I am the Gatekeeper.

## Okay, I'll help you. Should we make some dip or something?
He is the Destructor.

## Do you want this body?
Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.

## Really! Is it gone?
Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions. This one took some work.

## Hello, I'm Roger Delacorte - the Head Librarian. Are you the men from the University?
Yes. I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.

## Did you see it? What was it?
We'll get back to you.

## It's a great game! You should play sometime. I bet you'd be good. You seem very athletic. Do you have any hobbies?
I collect spores, molds and fungus.

## Die in what sense?
In the physical sense.

## What is it?
It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow. It's my lucky coin.

## What calls?
Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job. She paid with a Visa card.

## The EPA? What's he want?
I didn't ask him. All I know is that I haven't had a break in two weeks and you promised you'd hire more help.

## Did you ever report it to anyone?
Heavens, no! The owners don't like us to even talk about it. I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.

## Can I help you?
I'm Walter Peck. I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, Third District.

## Are you Peter Venkman?
Yes, I'm Doctor Venkman.

## Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr. Venkman?
I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.

## I see. And now you catch ghosts?
You could say that.

## And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
I'm not at liberty to say.

## And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
In a storage facility.

## And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
Yes, it would.

## And may I see this storage facility?
No, you may not.

## And why not, Mr. Venkman?
Because you didn't say the magic word.

## Why do you want to see it?
Go ahead! Get a court order. Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.

## A square?
Good guess -- but no.

## Circle?
Close -- but definitely wrong.

## Nervous?
Yes. I don't like this.

## Two wavy lines?
Sorry. This isn't your day.

## Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks. What are you trying to prove?
I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.

## Hey, Mister! Can I see those guns?
They're not guns. They're particle throwers.

## Wait! Wait! Let me ask you something. If you like shot Superman with those guns, would he feel it or what?
The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...

## When you were in the bathroom, did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly?
Oh! You're here.

## What have you got, Egon?
Oh, this is big, Peter. This is very big. There's definitely something here.

## Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
I'm always serious.

## Generally, you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance. What do you think, Egon?
She's telling the truth -- or at least she thinks she is.

## Did you see anything?
Something was definitely here.

## What?
Don't cross the beams.

## Why not?
Trust me. It will be bad.

## What is it?
I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.

## Some. I just met the Keymaster. He's here with me now. Venkman? Are you there?
Yeah, yeah. I was just thinking. It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.

## Who?
Gozer.

## You talked to Gozer?
Get a grip on yourself, Egon. I talked to Dana Barrett and she referred to Gozer as the Destructor.

## What now?
Full-stream with strogon pulse.

## I've got to sleep.
Ray! Where are you? Are you all right?

## I need two new purge valves. How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
I'm worried, Ray. It's getting crowded in there. And all my recent data points to something big on the bottom.

## What happened?!!!?
The storage facility blew. This one ... ... shut off the protection grid.

## You mean if I stand here and concentrate on the image of Roberto Clemente, Gozer will appear as Roberto Clemente and wipe us out?
That appears to be the case.

## Excuse me for a minute. Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here. Can you come back in about an hour?
Sure. That's great, Ray. I think you should get down there right away and check it out. Let me know what happens.

## Uh-huh. I've heard about the rockfall, Ray. I think you've been spending too much time with Spengler.
What do you mean by \"seen?\"

## What is it?
It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.

## What do we do now?
I don't know. Talk to it.

## What do I say?
Anything! Just make contact.

## \"Get her?\" That was your whole plan? You call that science?
If you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I could win the Nobel Prize.

## For what purpose?
To go into business for ourselves.

## Do you think it's wide enough? How much?
Fourteen hundred.

## How was your date?
It wasn't a date. It was an investigation.

## Don't move. It won't hurt you.
Where are you, Pete?

## How do you know?
I don't know. I'm just guessing.

## Egon, how's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
It's not good, Pete.

## Who was the architect?
He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor.

## Yeah, I heard that. Now tell me what you really do.
Agile bastard, isn't he?

## Hey man. What is it you're so involved with there?
Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.

## Are you a Christian, Ray?
Mmmhmmm.

## Do you believe in God?
No. But I liked Jesus' style.

## Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
And the seas would boil ...

## Well, has it ever occurred to you that the reason you've been so busy lately is because the dead have been rising from their graves?
You don't have to worry about that with us, sir.

## What's he talking about? Choose what?
Maybe you should get married. Pick one of your cousins, it would demonstrate a profound stability.

## I should at least have you, don't you think?
If you get me pregnant with a boy he'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne.

## Did Narcissus die today? Wasn't this his day to die?
Kill him! Tribuus -- execute that bastard.

## Taking my pleasure. Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.

## What is that... wailing?
The fans of Narcissus. They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo. They believe he's dying.

## What are you talking about?
Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.

## Lykas, pick a man. Someone who will look good. Jerses I want it built up in the Daily Action...
But I get what I want, always, don't I?

## Do you want posters, too?
Damn him! I should have killed him on the front -- I let you talk me out of that.

## Do you expect Marcus to be well enough by morning for an audience?
That's difficult to say, general.

## Oh, but with the army behind you, you could become extremely political. Not a Republican by any chance?
I would say there's nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what 'right' is.

## Caesar?
That this illness has clouded his mind.

## Where is my family?
Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate. I could have executed you.

## On what charge?
Insubordination. To the Emperor... and the Senate.

## Gods of hell! This must cost a fortune! How many days is this going to go on?
Until your confirmation date.

## Give away food?
Sacks of grain, even bread. I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.

## Take grain away from the army?
Make a gift to the people. It's your money anyway so it's only fair.

## Tribuus, what happened in the arena? Was Narcissus killed?
He must have been. He was on the list of prisoners to be executed.

## Yes, Caesar?
Jerses -- tomorrow...

## The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates. He was born on August thirty-first, you know.
Commodus... he's a gladiator... is he mad?

## God of passages and changes?
I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory. Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.

## But have never been?
My only visits to Rome, Senator, have been through books. But the war's over, time to close the door of war once and for all.

## The Senate too?
I hope you live to see what I believe...

## How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.

## I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
You're a citizen and a soldier. Not a gladiator.

## Why you?
My loyalties... were in doubt.

## Is this Rome? Are we just going to be executed?
They can't... if this is Rome...

## You know our two most senior Senators, Gaius Cantus and Falco Verus?
Only from a distance.

## Sneaking around with your brother?
Without him. He'd be weeping if he overheard that. Well? The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting.

## Why do you play at being drunk?
It's my brother's neck you want, not mine.

## Narcissus, I have your family. They're alive. All of them.
Do you remember your Epictetus, that little homily we recited when we were children? The one that was supposed to remind us we were Romans?

## Where are they?
Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.

## Servis made it through again?
He's like you, sir, too tough for the Gods to swallow.

## Tomorrow?
As soon as I can.

## On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?
On my honor as your daddy...

## What the hell was all that about?
What the hell do you think it was about? There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.

## What deal?
Rome is going to pay an allotment to the German tribes on an annual basis.

## Rome is going to pay tribute -- like a defeated nation begging for mercy? Have you told your troops that?
He's very realistic.

## Isn't the helmet magnificent?
Well, you wanted the girls to have the best teachers.

## Greeks?
Athenians...

## What about their philosophy lessons?
They're studying with Cynics.

## This is our oil from our estates?
I've been overseeing production myself for the past three years, you'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become.

## I'm a soldier -- we're at war. I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.

## You're a legate in the Roman army. Huh...? and you act like one. What was your crime?
I killed too many barbarians.

## Condemned? Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?
Death is a very light thing for you.

## General, do you realize what happened out there today?
I didn't get killed and everyone else did.

## How much money is involved?
A great deal. They designed and build Tiger's chariot...

## I can really rape them on this! Can I at least tell them you'll think about it?
No. Tell them I'll do it. But I want more posters all over Rome.

## Right, right, what am I thinking of?
I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.

## Was I?
I want nothing to do with the arena.

## Something else, then. Do the chariot races interest you?
Commodus must hate you. Free your gladiators and come with us.

## You're living at home now. Is that right?
Yes.

## Do you know what you're going to do?
No.

## Are you going to graduate school?
No.

## Do you always drive like this?
Yes.

## Do you want some dinner?
I'd love some.

## Aren't you eating?
No.

## Why not?
If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry.

## No -- why should I?
I don't know.

## Could you do it?
No.

## Will you take me home now?
I just want to tell you something.

## What?
This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.

## Listen -- could you stop crying, please?
No, I couldn't.

## But could you try?
No.

## Is anything wrong?
No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.

## Where we going?
I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.

## What is the matter?
Nothing. I'm just wondering if they have a bar or not. I mean let's go see. Let's go see if they do or not.

## Benjamin -- do they know you?
Of course not.

## Ben -- what's happening? Who is Mr. Gladstone?
I don't know. They must think I look like this guy Gladstone.

## Do you?
Yes.

## Was she married or something?
Yes.

## With a family?
Yes. She had a husband and a son.

## Did they ever find out?
No.

## You sure you really want to?
Yes.

## You do?
Benjamin -- I really do.

## What's the matter?
You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.

## Benjamin -- what's happening?
Hurry up. Put your shoes on.

## Why aren't you ready?
Because I want to know what's happening.

## What?
That woman. The older woman.

## Where are you meeting this person?
At the Zoo.

## The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
I've never been to it.

## Is that him over there?
No.

## Where did he say he was going to meet you?
I thought he said by the monkey house.

## Here? In Berkeley?
Yes.

## What?
I've got a real feeling that this is the fellow.

## No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
Because -- I am.

## What do you think?
I think it is.

## How could you do that, Benjamin?
Do you just hate everything? How could you possibly rape my...

## Did you say rape her?
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.

## What did she say?
Let me go.

## Why?
Because it isn't true.

## Then what?
Elaine -- right now I don't feel like talking much. I'm sorry about everything but I think I'll just do this now.

## Can I just sit here while you're packing?
If you want.

## What are you looking for?
My belt.

## Don't you have it on?
No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for. What's this? It's from my grandmother.

## The marble?
The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.

## What are you going to do now?
I don't know.

## Are you going home?
No.

## Well -- where are you going?
I don't want you to leave tomorrow.

## You won't?
I don't know.

## Is that so? You might marry me?
Yes.

## When?
I don't know.

## You mean you're confused?
Well -- look -- don't be confused. We're getting married.

## Elaine -- are you serious about this?
I'll think about it.

## You really will?
Yes.

## Tomorrow?
Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.

## We'll need our Birth Certificates. I happen to have mine with me. Where's yours?
I just don't think it would work.

## Why wouldn't it?
I just don't think it would...

## Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.

## Carl who?
Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.

## Who -- that guy at the Zoo?
Yes.

## Why do you have to see him?
Well -- I said I might marry him.

## Are we getting married tomorrow?
No.

## The day after tomorrow?
Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.

## Hello -- who is this?
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.

## Well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son's wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now. He should be checking in any moment --
Oh. Well -- I'm not sure -- but you might try the First Presbyterian. That's on Allan Street.

## Are you listening?
Yes I am.

## There is a great future in plastics. Think about it. Will you think about it?
Yes, I will.

## You a student?
Not exactly.

## What's that?
I said -- not exactly -- no.

## What are you then?
Well -- I'm just sort of traveling through.

## What?
One of those outside agitators.

## Who screamed?
It's all right, Mr. McCleery.

## What did you do to her?
Look -- she's all right. She's upset and she screamed. But she's okay now.

## All right, boys -- I think you can get back to your rooms. I don't think we'll have any more of this agitation. Will we, Braddock?
No, sir.

## Mr. McCleery?
You heard me. Out of here.

## What for?
Because I don't like you.

## Mr. McCleery -- do you have some change? I need to use the phone?
I want you out of here.

## Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?
I am going to call the police now.

## VOICE BENJAMIN?
Yes.

## VOICE Will you bring up my purse before you go?
I have to go now. I'm sorry.

## Mrs. Robinson?
VOICE I'm in the bathroom.

## VOICE Could you bring it up?
Well I'll hand it to you.

## VOICE For God's sake, Benjamin, will you stop acting that way and bring me the purse?
I'm putting it here by the door.

## VOICE Will you bring it in to me?
Uh -- The Taft Hotel.

## VOICE Give me an hour.
VOICE Did you get a room?

## What?
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.

## Yes sir?
A room. I'd like a room, please.

## A single room or a double room?
A single. Just for myself, please.

## Is anything wrong, sir?
What? No. Nothing.

## Do you have any luggage, Mister -- Gladstone?
Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.

## Where is your luggage?
Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.

## Sir?
I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.

## Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it?
It's down the hall.

## How are you, Benjamin?
Fine, thank you. The bathroom is down at the end of the hall.

## Is there an ashtray in here?
No.

## Is what a girl?
Whatever it is you're upset about.

## You don't?
No.

## What?
I want you to come in till I get the lights on.

## What for?
Because I don't feel safe until I get the lights on.

## Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?
All right then.

## What do you drink?
Benjamin -- I'm sorry to be this way, but I don't want to be alone in this house.

## Why not?
Please wait till my husband gets home.

## When is he coming back?
I don't know.

## Drink?
No.

## Are you always this much afraid of being alone?
Yes.

## Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
I'm very neurotic.

## What do you mean?
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.

## No.
Did you know I was an alcoholic?

## What?
My husband will be back quite late.

## Pardon?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.

## What?
I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.

## What do you think?
Well I don't know.

## So?
Mrs. Robinson -- you are trying to seduce me.

## Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
It's all right.

## Her portrait?
Yes.

## We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
Very much.

## Will you unzip my dress?
I think I'll go to bed.

## Won't you unzip my dress?
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.

## What are you so scared of?
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.

## Then why do you keep running away?
Because you're going to bed. I don't think I should be up here.

## Don't you think he trusts us together?
Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.

## Is that what you're trying to tell me?
I'm going home now. I apologize for what I said. I hope you can forget it. But I'm going home right now.

## Where is it?
On that chair in the hall.

## Benjamin?
Yes.

## May I sit down?
Of course.

## How are you?
Very well. Thank you.

## May I have a drink?
I haven't. No.

## Do you want to?
Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.

## Do you want me to get it?
You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.

## Now?
Yes -- I think that would be good.

## To tell you?
Yes.

## What?
The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.

## I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.

## Why don't you watch?
Oh -- sure. Thank you.

## What?
A hanger.

## What?
Wood or wire? They have both.

## Would this be easier for you in the dark?
Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.

## You what?
This is all terribly wrong.

## Are you afraid of me?
No -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson -- would you like to go to a movie.

## Is this -- what?
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.

## Now -- do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?
If you want.

## Good. I mean are we dead or something?
Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.

## Well what do you want to talk about?
Anything. Anything at all.

## Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
Oh my God.

## Oh.
Well?

## Don't you?
Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.

## You're not interested in art?
No.

## Then why do you want to talk about it?
I don't.

## Can I take off my clothes now?
No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.

## Do you really want me to?
Yes I do.

## Do you want to hear it or not?
Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.

## What?
Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.

## Him?
There isn't any.

## How do you get out of the house?
I walk out.

## What do you say to him?
He's asleep.

## Always?
Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.

## What?
We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.

## Can I undress and talk at the same time?
Right.

## Oh no. Are you kidding me?
No.

## You have not slept with your husband for five years?
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.

## No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
Is it?

## Well how do you feel about him, then?
I don't.

## Is it?
I mean it doesn't sound like it could be much worse. If you hated him at least you'd hate him.

## Well, wait a minute. You married him.
What?

## Why did you do that?
See if you can guess.

## I can't see why you did, unless... you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?
Don't tell Elaine.

## Are you shocked?
Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...

## I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
Not particularly.

## Was he a law student at the time?
And you were a student also.

## Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
Art.

## Art?
But I thought you -- I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.

## Well how did it happen?
How do you think.

## Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
I'm curious.

## Oh no. In the car you did it?
I don't think we were the first.

## Do you remember the make of the car?
Oh my God.

## Don't talk about Elaine?
No.

## Why not?
Because I don't want you to.

## Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.
Well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden?

## Do you understand that?
Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.

## But why shouldn't I?
I have my reasons.

## I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?
Yes.

## You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
I wouldn't know.

## Are you?
You're goddamn right I am.

## What?
Don't start acting hurt.

## Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.

## Did I say that?
Of course you did.

## What are you doing?
Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.

## May I stay then?
Yes. Please. I want you to.

## How?
In order to keep Elaine away from you -- I am prepared to tell her everything.

## I think we have everything quite under control now, Benjamin. Would you like a quick drink before you go?
Ahh. I don't think you'll have time for that drink after all.

## Sir?
The toothbrush. I got it all right.

## Can I talk to you a minute?
Sure.

## What?
Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.

## When I go off?
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.

## What else?
Nothing else.

## No wait. Wait.
Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?

## I don't meet anyone, mother, but why did you say that?
Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.

## Well why do you -- why do you think that?
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.

## Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do?
Not if you don't want to.

## You believe me, don't you?
No.

## You don't?
No -- they don't.

## Well -- when did you decide all this?
About an hour ago.

## When did you two talk this over?
I guess -- about my future.

## To be what?
Different.

## Why?
Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.

## Have you thought about graduate school?
No.

## Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?
You got me.

## I guess she's not good enough for you, is that it?
Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.

## Wait a minute. You talked to Elaine this morning?
No. She doesn't know about it.

## She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
No. Actually -- she doesn't know about us getting married yet.

## Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
Yes, sir.

## What?
I've got to go.

## Ben -- how old are you now?
You'll never be young again.

## How long have you and I known each other? How long have your Dad and I been partners?
Quite a while.

## What? You look like the kind of guy that has to fight them off. Doesn't he look to you like the kind of guy who has to fight them off?
Oh say -- Elaine gets down from Berkeley on Saturday.

## Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?
Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.

## What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
Yes.

## Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?
I am not threatening you.

## You don't respect me terribly much either, do you?
No, I don't.

## Why?
It shouldn't make any difference what happened.

## Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
Hello.

## Yes?
It's Benjamin.

## Yes?
Benjamin Braddock.

## Benjamin -- where are you?
Can you look through the glass.

## Can you see me now?
Yes, I can.

## It's a wonderful thing to have so many devoted friends.
Are you ready in there, feature attraction?

## What's happening?
Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.

## That what he says. Right?
No -- I told you not to come in this lobby.

## She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
Yes.

## And what are you going to do?
The pearls are in her room.

## Need any help?
No.

## I could take care of her.
Have you got that skeleton key?

## How?
Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...

## Get out and leave it to me... be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam...
Why?

## I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
With the pearls?

## What about the money?
I'll pay you back.

## How?
Not with strangers.

## He must be very nice.
Never?

## Who?
Whoever is keeping you waiting.

## Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That?
That.

## Tea would spoil my dinner. One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it.
You?

## Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a... ...a stenographer. Don't little stenographers earn little pennies?
Very little.

## Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though.
Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?

## Yes? -- Tomorrow?
Of course.

## Really?
We'll dance.

## Chasing what?
Money.

## Will you do me a big favor?
I'll do anything for you.

## Would you like to make a man happy?
Yes -- I'd love to.

## Why?
I feel sorry for him.

## Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
Going?

## You live here?
For tonight.

## What do you want here?
Nothing -- only to be here.

## Why do you hide in my room?
But surely you must know -- because I love you.

## Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do you good to cry? Are you afraid? Shall I go?
I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that. No. I am not afraid. It is strange.

## So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... What now?
I'd like to smoke a cigarette.

## And then --?
And -- and --

## And...?
He disappeared. Later he was found dead.

## Go away. Who are you --?
A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.

## I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
I want to be alone.

## Beautiful but so sad. I did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's bedroom.
Why do you smile?

## What?
The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you.

## Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.

## Really?
Really, I haven't a bit of character. None at all.

## And?
And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all.

## Oh! What a picture -- and what else?
I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief.

## What is the matter?
There.

## And now?
I couldn't go through with it. Remarkable.

## Do you understand?
Yes -- yes -- yes.

## You do believe that I really love you?
Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.

## Suzette will be back here any minute.
Shall I see you again?

## When are you leaving Berlin?
Very early in the morning.

## For Vienna?
Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both.

## Why later?
I have no money now -- I must get some first -- I must get some.

## Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?
Never mind -- I'll get it. I have a whole day. I'll be on that train.

## No?
No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- the pearls. You wear them now...

## On the train?
Do I know him -- I know him through and through.

## In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?
Where the music's playing and the ladies are...

## Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?
A little strange, Baron.

## A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?
No thanks -- keeping my head clear.

## I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?
Ready, Baron.

## Is that too much, Baron?
No -- not at all.

## You've lost everything?
I've no luck.

## All of that at once, Baron?
Here -- here it is. Here's your pocketbook, Kringelein.

## Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night?
Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances.

## That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?
Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes.

## Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here?
I must have made a mistake.

## Is that for me?
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.

## For me?
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.

## For me?
No -- letters to two-eighty.

## No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?
News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.

## What? -- Who? -- Whom?
The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.

## Good heavens. What for?
No, Doctor.

## Telegrams?
No, Doctor.

## Anyone asked for me?
Nobody, Doctor.

## Any letters?
I have nothing better to do, Mr. Kringelein.

## No pain, Mr. Kringelein?
Pain? Oh, no, Doctor. I think if I had pain I'd be too happy to notice it...

## Barman -- whiskey -- For you, Mr. Kringelein?
For me? -- Oh, please, something sweet and cold.

## What, Doctor?
A masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing...

## Everything?
Excuse me, gentlemen.

## Fourteen thousand marks... One can travel -- one's happiness might depend on fourteen thousand marks -- don't you think so, Baron?
Oh, I've got to find it.

## Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
To take dictation -- a Mr. Preysing -- Goodbye, you -- tomorrow at five o'clock.

## She's beautiful -- isn't she?
You must look at my face and not at the floor.

## Really?
Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- Lying there, his eyes so open.

## I didn't like Preysing right off.
You loved the Baron, didn't you?

## What?
Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there always.

## Later?
When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until...

## Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?
Oh yes, of course.

## Do you like me better?
Oh, there must be one in Paris... They have everything in Paris.

## Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' office?
No -- only occasional jobs.

## Tired?
You pay me.

## What is this?
I got ten marks for that.

## What?
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.

## Skiing?
Yes... A man I know took me to Switzerland last month...

## With the same friend?
No.

## What?
You're a little too fast.

## Can't you understand me?
I understand you perfectly.

## ...weight into the balance...
Have you got it now?

## How nice -- your daughters?
My daughters -- yes, my daughters.

## Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel?
That'll be all -- be here tomorrow at nine o'clock.

## Sit here. Cognac -- for you?
Nothing.

## Well -- you want me?
Yes.

## Well?
I must go to England -- at once.

## I understand perfectly.
Well?

## What do you think your salary would be -- for such a trip?
Of course -- of course.

## Can you pay some attention to me?
Oh, yes.

## You think so?
Come here.

## Call me -- do you know -- would you -- would you like to call me by my first name?
Oh, no.

## Why not?
I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.

## Very simple -- I've always liked the way you dressed, Preysing -- English, isn't it?
What we want to know about is Manchester.

## What?
They turn out marvelous material in Manchester.

## Manchester -- yes. Yes, yes, they do. Yes -- Now gentlemen shall we begin at the beginning? -- Have we cigars -- water and everything?
We have a good many connections in England, naturally.

## I mean with the Manchester people?
Sorry, Preysing.

## Goodbye, Preysing, I hope you pull through. This is a very bad time to be in such a crisis. We've...
You've decided against the merger?

## What?
Oh no -- no -- the session is over. Let's go, it's off. Thank you, gentlemen.

## Foggy -- frightfully foggy, always, I'm told. Have you said anything about Manchester, Mr. Preysing?
Since, on the eleventh of June of this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger...

## Shall I tell them again?
Why waste time -- it's getting late.

## Madam has slept well?
Oh, yes, Suzette.

## I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.

## Where is Pimenov? Where is Pimenov?
I'm cancelling the engagement.

## Suzette -- I told you not to bring the pearls. I will not wear them tonight.
The house is not full -- Is it really full?

## Why not?
Take them back, Suzette.

## But when did he go? How do you know?
Mr. Kringelein will take room number one-seventy-six, one of our most expensive rooms. It is large and on the front with bath.

## Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private?
Certainly, sir.

## Again?
Please.

## I wish you a very good evening, Mr. Preysing. You are staying here, too, Mr. Preysing?
I don't know you.

## Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
You may go, Mr. Kringelein.

## What is this insolence?
Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man.

## Me?
Yes you -- shut your mouth -- get out -- you're discharged.

## It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir.
Yes, I know them --

## Did I say I wanted a cheap room to live in -- when I came here did I ask for a cheap room? Did I?
Just one moment, sir.

## How is the house?
Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz -- Just jazz.

## The troupe, the scenery, everything -- all on board, waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come, Madam, are you mad?
Four minutes past. Please come.

## Have I kept you waiting?
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.

## No news yet?
Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.

## Next week.
Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?

## What's the matter with you?
Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.

## What's bluff?
That.

## What do you want with her?
I want to see her, I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law.

## Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
Pretty as a picture.

## Did I buy you that dress, you piece of shit?
Well, I guess so. You're the guy I work for.

## How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?
I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.

## One question. Do you want to stick to that story, or do you want to keep your teeth?
He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.

## You expect me to buy this?
I got a lot of people work for me, Lilly. I can't have shit like this.

## You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?
No.

## You mean, the insurance frammis?
Tell me about the oranges, Lilly.

## And if you do it wrong?
It can louse up your insides. You can get puh, puh, puh...

## What's that, Lilly?
Permanent damage.

## You want a drink?
Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.

## Not skimming a thing, Lilly?
Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.

## Those trucks. I know exactly what you mean.
A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?

## Do you have something around back, facing away from the road?
I'll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet. Faces the desert.

## Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
Right in front of the room.

## Well, of course not! I know how dangerous this is. But I would trust Mister Hebbing with anything. Wouldn't I, darling?
Well, I'll have to take your word for it, Mary Beth. Here's your money.

## Want a look?
And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.

## One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?
Well, you've got your information ahead of New York, I see that.

## Why? What's wrong?
You are a valued customer, as you know.

## But what's wrong?
I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see.

## What is?
Why, of course it is. I can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars.

## I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.

## Whadaya say?
Hello.

## What's up?
That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman.

## That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?
Well, uh... No.

## Well...
No?

## See you in a week, Roy. I can call you Roy?
Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I like things the way they are now. Pick my own hours, have time for, uh, other activities...

## That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough?
Fair enough.

## So what's your story today?
They twisted my arm.

## Sure I am. What made you turn up, after all these years?
I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks. Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son.

## Nice to see you. What am I doing in here?
Well... You're all right now, I guess. I have to get down to the track.

## What happened to your hand?
Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills, I'll take care of them.

## Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that?
No. And you have to be.

## Bluebell came in?
I sent Bobo ten grand of my own money, like it was the winnings from my bets. I hoped that would cover me. It didn't.

## Lucky? You call that lucky?
I tripped over a chair.

## Why?
You don't have the stomach for it.

## Roy! What are you doing in San Diego?
Myra and me come down to LaJolla for the weekend.

## Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
Roy, I don't want money from you.

## Expecting visitors?
No. That was the point.

## I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh?
After the meet. Back to Baltimore.

## Going somewhere?
Somewhere else, that's for sure.

## Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it.

## She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo. I guess to get me running. Did you tell her about my stash?
No.

## No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.

## I sat in there with her, I thought, what do I do now? Run and I've got Bobo and the law after me. Stay, and how do I explain?
This way's perfect.

## Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.

## At what?
You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.

## No.
What?

## You want a drink?
I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.

## No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.

## You're getting off the grift?
That's right.

## If you stayed a crook, do you think you'd live to be my ripe age?
I don't see why not.

## What?
There's nothing more to talk about.

## You heard the shower, didn't you?
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.

## I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
This time...

## Where's the five?
In your other hand.

## Well, well. In a real hurry, are we?
Always, for you, baby.

## Taking you for granite?
That isn't granite. If that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all.

## Are you sure?
Let's find out.

## Mm?
Look at me.

## Roy? It this all we have?
All? It ain't bad.

## What are you talking abut, Myra? Marriage?
I didn't say that. You aren't marriage material.

## Ow! Hey, what are you trying to do, throw me off my game?
No, baby. Come to Mama.

## You called the doctor, huh?
Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.

## Oh, yeah? Thanks. How long do they say I'm in here?
Her job.

## What if we want to drive somewhere while we're there?
We'll rent a car.

## What?
I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.

## Working the what?
Oh, come on, Roy.

## You talk the lingo. What's your pitch?
The long end. Big con.

## Is that right?
It is, Roy! And now, right now, it's the perfect time, the best time since I've been in the game.

## No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
And when he got serious?

## Yeah? How?
Oh, Roy, it was great! We were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year.

## What happened to Cole?
He retired.

## Where?
Upstate.

## Upstate where?
Atascadero.

## That's where they keep the criminally insane, isn't it?
I just bet you are, too. And now you're trying to rope me.

## Take a hike, you mean?
I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man, and you're it. You could be as wonderful as Cole.

## Think about it. Okay?
Sure.

## I still don't see why we have to have separate rooms. You expect your father to come through?
Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.

## Yeah?
Open your door.

## What? What for?
Open it and find out.

## ) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
I saw her.

## But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
Come on, Myra, don't talk business here. This is time out.

## Yes or no. They're both easier at home. Okay?
The last I looked, we were just talking things over.

## That's what I say.
Don't I get any say in this?

## What?
What I say is, no. We don't do partners.

## For Christ's sake, why not?
Bullshit!

## What is it? What's going on?
I'm happy the way I am.

## ) What?
Sure it is. That's why you act so funny around each other.

## Don't act so goddamned innocent! You and your own mother, gah! You like to go back where you been, huh?
Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police. I have a car here.

## Gun?
It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.

## Do you have any particular reason to say that?
My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day.

## You up to it now?
Sure. Let's get it over.

## What?
Ate the gun. Oh.

## Not many laughs in this room, eh?
Not many.

## No, its -- Why did she--?
That's that, then.

## Why am I here?
They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.

## Right. So why don't we get on with this investigation?
I like a woman who takes control.

## Impressive, Blake. Where'd you learn how to do that?
Girl scouts.

## Where?
The cemetery...

## You take all your dates here. Blake?
Only the real stiffs.

## Care to join me?
Come on, Carter. You know it's Michael.

## What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
Yes.

## It's Blake. How do you feel about Wisconsin?
We're sorry to startle you, Miss Tate.

## Mind if we sit down?
I'd prefer you didn't. I'm very busy.

## Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
Detective...

## A dead body?
It's Amy Kramer.

## Do you know who did this?
Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.

## Think Eddie had something to do with it?
Doesn't look good.

## What the fuck are you talking about?
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver. It was a butcher knife.

## Who are you, the serial killer police? What difference does it make?
It's not historically accurate, that's all.

## Hey, Mis Whittington, what's up?
My blood pleasure. You scared the hell out of me.

## Jimmy, what are you doing?
Checking out your place.

## You sure?
Totally. I checked all the rooms and closets...

## Nothing's missing?
Don't think so. But they sure did a real number on your office. Crap everywhere.

## My office?
Yeah. Oh, and they messed up your kitchen pretty good, too... Goodnight.

## Okay, you win. I'll call you Mom. Now can I move into the dorms?
No.

## The dorms are only fifty feet away. You could practically see into my window. So, what difference does it make?
My point exactly. See, we both agree.

## I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
My life is a living hell.

## To the bathroom. Can I do that alone or do you want to watch?
I thought you'd never ask.

## You're kidding with that answer, right?
I just went for a walk. It's no big deal.

## Or what? You're gonna shoot me?
It's an option.

## Oh, so now it's my fault?
Just forget it...

## You some kind of fugitive or something?
I was trying to get away from someone.

## Now you're joking, right?
Afraid not. You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family.

## Wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle?
Yes.

## Any other psychotic relatives I should know about? Jason? Freddy Krueger?
No.

## Why didn't you tell me?
I was trying to protect you from this...

## Where are you going?
I don't know.

## He found you, didn't he?
Get on the bus.

## What? Where is she?
John...

## Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom?
That would work.

## Where'd you get it?
Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.

## You stole it?
I borrowed it.

## Why not?
I can't afford to get caught.

## Can I come in?
Are you crazy? You'll get caught.

## You really think Eddie killed her?
You saw that Michael Meyers display. You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.

## Better?
Yeah.

## Molly, of all the people... if I can't trust my resident assistant, then what?
Looks great. It does.

## It's John, isn't it?
It's always John.

## Still wants to move out?
He's been living out of moving boxes for three months.

## Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
Doesn't make it bad advice.

## I'm going into town... run a few errands before dark. Need anything?
A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.

## What are you looking at?
I'm fine. I just need to lie down...

## What?
My name hasn't always been Keri Tate. It was once Laurie Strode.

## Who?
Michael Meyers.

## The serial killer?
He's my brother.

## Are you going to leave, too?
Never.

## So you're really Michael Meyers' sister?
Yeah.

## Do we have to invite him to the wedding?
Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will.

## Keri, you all right?
We've got to get these kids out of here...

## You think your mom knows we snuck out last night?
Wait.

## What is it?
I have to pee.

## You aced it, didn't you?
I did alright.

## What's this?
You say, \"The key to my heart,\" and I'm gonna hurl.

## You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
Condom Boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria.

## He do that to you?
Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.

## Why? You interested?
No! I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.

## Mom -- Who is this?
Kara? ... No, this is Beth.

## Is Tim there?
He's in the bathroom.

## Whatever happened to women in back?
Jesus, that's my neighbor. Tommy.

## Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?
Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.

## What if your parents come home?
Then they can watch.

## The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
Aren't you gonna answer that?

## He says things. Bad things.
They did, did they? Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?

## No one's coming to get you. Not while I'm around.
Like what?

## Promise?
I promise.

## See what I'm talkin' about?
You'll never pass that exam on an empty stomach, Kara.

## What is it this time?
I'm getting the children out of here. At least until we know what we're dealing with. John, I want you to come with us.

## Who are you?
I've come to help your family.

## What makes you think he'll come here again?
Jamie? But I thought she was --

## What should I do?
Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.

## No, please listen! They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?

## Do you know how insane this is? Who am I supposed to be looking for?
Him.

## God, what's wrong with him?
Here. Let me try.

## Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
To find the rest of your family before Michael Myers does -- or whoever's been controlling him.

## What is that?
It's a sign. He's come home.

## There you are. Who was that boy?
An old friend.

## Any word on the location of the Strodes?
No one's home. Checked it out myself.

## What's wrong? What's happened to Jamie?
I'll meet you over there.

## Where's the child?
This is madness, Wynn.

## Why did you take Jamie?
Jamie's baby ...

## Yes?
I dunno, boy.

## Hm?
It's a bitch.

## You know what gets me?
No.

## Used to be against the law, didn't it?
I suppose.

## You know what gets me?
Oh, shit.

## Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
At least we found the diamonds.

## Can I have the Cadillac?
Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.

## So long, Colonel.
What'll you do for transportation?

## You know what gets me?
I'm lonesome already.

## And how were things?
Let's talk about something else.

## Otherwise, how are things?
I sure didn't expect her to drop dead.

## How about breakfast, wife?
I dunno, boy.

## What's funny about that?
You know me, boy.

## He and his love are like a retiarius. Do you know what a retiarius is?
He's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and doesn't wear anything but a jockstrap.

## How do you know that?
You told me.

## When?
When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.

## Sorry.
Really?

## You keep on saying \"deep\" and \"deeply.\" I wish something good would happen on the surface sometime.
Go to the funeral?

## So, kid--how they hanging? Or don't you say that to a little kid?
He's a man. Tell him you're a man.

## I dunno. You know. I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.

## Maybe it's time you got out.
You did?

## Me?
You.

## Hello.
If what?

## The posies are for her?
I wanted to apologize.

## Are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die?
I'd rather go to Viet Nam.

## That can be arranged.
Would somebody please pass me the catsup?

## Fifty years?
We got to get another pilot.

## For what?
For Africa.

## Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman?
You invited me.

## What went wrong?
Gee whiz--

## Sir?
Life has denied me that thrill.

## Do you mind if I ask who you are?
Mind? God, yes, I mind. I'm your father's friend. A man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago.

## Is anybody besides you here now?
The doctor was called away on an emergency. I think it was birth.

## You don't know where your mother is? Does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night?
She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle, I guess.

## You think you could find me a pencil and paper?
I'll see.

## I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind. If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much. When did you know my father?
Man and boy.

## Even this--\"Herb Shuttle\", you said?
He worships Father.

## Ah! And what sort of man is this worshiper?
He's a vacuum cleaner salesman.

## College?
She has a master's degree in English literature.

## He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother. You know what he called Father one time?
Nothing. He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.

## He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War. Were you in a war with Father?
Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise.

## England?
Oh hell.

## Uck.
Dad was never in England?

## Don't care for cold steel? A knife is worse than a bullet?
I don't know.

## The story gets hairier. Should I stop?
Go on.

## Where did you get the poison?
Mhravitch. Remember that name.

## Sir?
I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.

## Does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that?
They're not engaged.

## Sir?
Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt.

## I can't take my eyes off you.
Is Looseleaf Harper alive?

## She was on her way home from a meeting of the African Violet Society, and they got her.
Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you?

## Will you go to bed?
Yes sir. If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks.

## Play?
Your mother and I do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours.

## Can I get dressed first?
Leave a tip.

## What kind of exercise?
Beat the shit out of someone who hates you.

## Who was it?
It's Mom.

## What's this?
Nothing.

## That's a rifle you have?
No.

## Of course it is. Is it loaded?
I don't want to fight you.

## I think so, daughter. How old are you?
Eighteen-- and a half.

## What time do you get off work, my child?
I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married. My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.

## Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
I'm engaged.

## Some kind of animal?
The pelt is black. It's a kind of man.

## How do you do, Mrs. Ryan? I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are. Am I intruding here?
Not at all.

## What's the matter?
Give us time.

## What sort of time period do you have in mind? Half an hour? An hour?
I don't know. This is a new disease to me.

## Disease?
Situation.

## You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
Every fuse in my nervous system has been blown.

## What's that all about?
We thought a doctor might help.

## Your old beau?
We thought it was an emergency.

## Shouldn't you lie down?
When I'm dead-- or fucking.

## I did?
We were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again. What we need is a honeymoon. Let's start right now.

## A trip, you mean?
I had a trip. We'll honeymoon here. Go out and play.

## Turn around?
And lots of orange juice--oceans of orange juice.

## We're all going to have to go out for breakfast. The cook quit yesterday.
Which one?

## You're a woman, aren't you?
Cook, by God! Cook! You're the nigger now.

## People now have dignity when frying eggs?
They don't have to feel like slaves.

## Let me guess--breakfast is served?
No.

## What then?
That's what you're supposed to say.

## You learned this in some college course?
I learned a lot of things in college. Actually--it was Norbert who told me that.

## And what is his most cherished possession?
His most cherished possession? His violin, I guess.

## And he keeps it in his apartment?
Yes.

## And no one's there now?
I don't think so.

## What are you going to do?
Because if you do--I'll leave you. HAROLD Goodbye.

## A dozen?
It's a big and busy funeral home.

## Did you like it, dear?
Unless she has nerve.

## You feel I've done a dreadful thing--leaving him?
Well--what have we here? A family.

## Rifle?
He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.

## And you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not detest him for his cowardice?
It seems highly intelligent to me.

## Blue soup?
Sounds quite beautiful.

## You're begging him to kill you?
If he thinks he's man enough.

## If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
Honor, I suppose.

## And my son, the only son of Harold Ryan--he's going to grow up to be a vanisher, too?
I don't know. I hope he never hunts. I hope he never kills another human being.

## You hope this, too?
There has to be a threat of some sort, nobility of some sort, glamour of some sort, sport of some sort. These elements are lacking.

## Where's the bullet?
Help your mother find the bullet.

## How do I load?
Load it for her.

## All right! Am I exceedingly dangerous now?
The National Safety Council would be appalled.

## Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
Gentlemen--that's nice.

## The door ws unlocked. Is it always unlocked?
It's always locked.

## You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
We tried to be. We tried to be.

## Dead! Such a final word. Dead! Did you hear that?
Neighbor! Doctor! I live across the hall.

## Tough luck. You'll have to split the fee.
And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?

## Are--are you crying, Penelope?
She's crying because she's so happy.

## Well now--what seems to be the trouble with the patient today? A touch of malaria, perhaps?
I know malaria. Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.

## Pacqualinincheewa root.
You have chills?

## Would you say that again?
Pacqualinincheewa root. Means \"cougar fang.\" Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.

## Are you've seen it work cures?
Hundreds.

## We have, have we?
That's an editorial we, of course. I haven't turned up anything personally.

## What for?
Quarantine, possibly. You may be suffering from a loathsome disease which the American people could do without. Goodbye.

## This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
There's a certain amount of information there.

## What brought you back?
The same hairy, humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon. \"Honor, \" if you like.

## There's going to be no bloodshed here. I know how he'll fight--the only way he can fight, with words. The truth. Am I correct?
Yes.

## We'll find out now, won't we?
You're a filthy, rotten bastard.

## Now who's being cruel?
A living fossil! Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.

## Hands and knees, you say?
And terror, if you don't mind.

## You're in one hell of a jam. You realize that?
If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.

## This is going to become very physical. Are you prepared for that?
You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.

## I'm an honorable clown?
King Arthur.

## Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew?
Cut me open. Find out.

## I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.
With spittle?

## Was I ever of use?
Never. For when you began to kill for the fun of it, you became the chief source of agony of mankind.

## More clowning! Don't you see?
We never quit fighting until we're dead.

## You'd be killing a friend. Don't you know how much I like you?
I'm going to shoot you now.

## Can I beg for mercy--on my knees?
If you want to be found that way.

## What is this thing that kills me?
Man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders. He will soon be extinct. It's time, it's time.

## What are you going to do?
Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.

## Jesus--I dunno. You know. What the heck. Who knows?
Colonel Harper, retired now, dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki during the Second World War, killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash.

## You don't know?
It was a bitch.

## And you went home unannounced, too?
I dunno. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! I did.

## You didn't even find that out?
There was so much going on.

## Alice is dead?
No, no--shit no. Excuse me, Penelope.

## What happened?
How horrible.

## What will you do, Colonel?
I dunno. Marry the first whore who's nice to me, I guess. Get a job in a motorcycle shop. So long, you guys.

## Aha! Hello! You're Mildred, right?
I heard you were looking for me.

## You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right?
Yes.

## Because he was cruel?
Premature ejaculation.

## Ja?
Never mind. It's a dumb theory. I was going to say it was all sexual..but everything is sexual...but alcohol. Peace.

## I had not the slightest inkling. Why didn't you say so?
Kid--kid--

## Men can touch other men, and it doesn't mean a thing. Haven't you ever seen football players after they've won the Superbowl?
I worship your father. That stuffed alligator your mother gave me--the one he shot? It's the proudest thing in my apartment.

## Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
No.

## A what kind of doctor?
A fairy--a queer. Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.

## How did she lose her feet?
In a railroad accident many years ago.

## Where will you be?
Anywhere but here. I'd just sit here and cry about the way my father's been forgotten.

## What difference does that make? Is Dr. Woodly going to be my father now?
No.

## Then who flushed the toilet?
Father's friend.

## What's his name?
That man is your father.

## What?
There stands the loins from which you've sprung.

## It is you, isn't it, Harold?
That's why I'm crying.

## What does he say to do?
He can hardly talk.

## It is an emergency, isn't it?
Yeah.

## You're going out?
We don't have a maid any more.

## I apologize. But you didn't know him, and neither did I. How's your asthma?
Don't worry about it.

## Maybe it's supposed to end now. Maybe God wouldn't have it any other way.
How's the fungus around your thumbnail?

## I didn't get his name. A friend of your father?
He isn't any friend of Father.

## He isn't?
He is my father.

## I'll get ready, Herb. I didn't expect you this soon. Please--won't everybody be nice to everybody else while I'm gone?
I keep having this nightmare--that he catches us.

## Doing what?
Something happens to my confidence.

## What then?
We could have had some kind of birthday party for him. We could have taken Paul to the fight with us.

## Did you see him?
Yeah.

## Is he all right?
Far as I know.

## Is he coming home?
He ditched me. He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.

## What was it?
He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.

## We got a birthday cake, kid. Did you see the cake?
Possibly.

## Well--it was nice while it lasted. Thanks for the memories.
How long has this been going on?

## Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?
Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.

## What?
I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.

## It is?
That's the XKE.

## The what?
It's an experimental model. He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.

## I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
What kind of a life is that?

## Meaning?
Every night, Penelope, for the past two years, I've made it a point to walk through the park at midnight.

## He'd go to a movie. I think that's what he'd do. If I were sure he was in a movie, I could stop worrying. We could have him paged.
Why would you do that?

## You know each other?
We met here earlier this evening.

## It's really that bad?
You fool, you fool.

## Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?
Everything's going to be beautiful.

## Is that a fact?
That maid just quit. The place is a mess. You can start in the master bedroom.

## You can believe that if you want. I talk to guys like you, and I want to commit suicide. You get that weight-lifting set I sent you?
Start with the smallest weights. Every week add a pound or two.

## You ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day?
He died of a massive rupture.

## Hello. My name is Beatrice. Have you been here before?
No.

## You sure? We have regular sessions, too. Only twenty dollars?
You're not exactly the type we're looking for.

## You mean I'm black?
No, just not the type.

## What are you doing?
Two officers have been assigned to the case. I can't keep them on indefinitely, but we'll go through every lead.

## I heard you the first time. We had nothing to go on with this kid. Just a runaway. Do you really think he's in danger?
We aren't gonna arrest him for that...

## Do you want to take a session?
I just want to ask some questions.

## Do you have any particular choice of girl?
You'll be fine.

## You're still dressed?
Well, I want to...

## You want a tip?
Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.

## What do you mean?
What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it.

## Now, what do you want?
I said I just wanted to talk to you...

## ...about this woman. I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
Look, I don't know anybody. I never seen her before.

## I'm getting angry. I want some answers. Where's the guy who runs this place?
Who is it? That blond guy? Where is he? I'm going to talk to someone.

## Where is he? Where's the bastard that runs this shit hole?
I'd like to place a 'Personals' ad in the Free Press.

## THE WINDOW How many weeks?
Just one.

## Hello. You want some information?
Yeah.

## I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
I don't know no Tod.

## What girls you got here?
My name is Hope. This is Faith. Charity's in back.

## Man, how many girls do you need?
I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.

## Is this all the display space we can get?
I tried to get more, but this is the limit. The De Vries line has the same area.

## Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...

## What's that shade of blue called?
Pavonine. It's the same tint as the stripe in the fabric.

## Sam?
Yeah. He's a nice guy. Don't lose him. Maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit. It's a little...

## Overpowering?
Yeah.

## Are you sure it's all right?
Yes. I think it'll look better.

## Are you the star of this picture?
You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.

## She thinks so. What do you do?
I work with Ramada. We're doing some pictures together.

## Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that picture?
No.

## You making a feature?
Um-hm. Live sound.

## You know her?
No. I saw her with Tod.

## Do you know where she lives?
Nah.

## Where is she?
Tod might know.

## Where's he?
Last I heard he went to San Diego.

## Something like that. How much do you make?
Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.

## Three hundred?
This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall.

## Up front?
Half now, half later.

## Tonight. When you get out, we'll go. Why didn't you tell the other detective?
This is different. This is nine hundred dollars.

## I thought you were going to bed?
I am.

## Huh?
Niki. Calm down. Relax. Let's just talk for a while. Then, later, you'll go back to your room and we'll get some sleep.

## You have anything to drink? You want to go out and get something?
I don't drink, but you can go out.

## You don't drink?
Ulcers.

## You're not a private detective either, are you?
No.

## I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?
A friend.

## Of Joanne's?
Yeah. I'm her father.

## And your wife? Where's she?
She's dead.

## What rate?
You know what I'm talking about.

## Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?
You don't understand shit.

## You used to work at Copper Penny?
No.

## Why? Are you a sex fiend?
No.

## How important do you think sex is?
Not very.

## What do you care about?
I care about my daughter.

## What's T-J?
Tijuana.

## They were here?
Tod was. He was with Ratan.

## What does that mean? What does he do?
He deals in pain.

## So it's already worked out. The fix is in?
More or less.

## You really believe all that?
Yeah. Well, mostly.

## Why can't I meet him now?
Rot in hell, honey. He's busy now.

## On your own land?
Look, I really don't know your daughter but...

## But what?
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.

## Yeah. She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
Just a guess. Did you have it good with your wife? You know, sex.

## Granville?
Look, Niki, this really isn't my business. I don't know anything about...

## Where is he?
I can't tell you that.

## Well, what do they know?
Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.

## ...What do you have to offer?
If I was you, Mr. Mast, I'd watch my language.

## Who's paying you?
You are.

## Mast?
Yeah.

## Can you meet me in about an hour? At the Pantlind Hotel?
I've got a meeting...

## What are you paying me for?
I'll be there.

## What have you found out?
I've got some news. Your daughter's all right. At least I think she is.

## Where is she?
I don't know.

## Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
No.

## Do you know what a \"hardcore\" movie is?
That's like a stag film.

## Yeah. You ever seen any of those?
No.

## They are?
Yeah. All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.

## Where is she?
I don't know.

## Where did you get that film?
I bought it at a store in L.A.

## Who made it?
I don't know.

## What's it called?
It was called 'Slave of Love' when I bought it. Next time it's sold, it'll be called something else.

## Do the police want to arrest me?
Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.

## I just heard. Who is he?
It's just a name.

## Does she know anything about this?
Who? The whore? No. She's just a victim. A dime a dozen.

## What happened, pilgrim?
Just leave me alone.

## You want to go for coffee after we send the girls off?
No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.

## What is it, Jake?
Wes, Anne, come here a moment.

## Is Marsha there?
Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.

## How's your business, Jake?
Pretty good.

## How did you find me?
Wes, do me a favor.

## What?
Leave me alone. Go home. Go away.

## What is going on?
I think I've found a way to find Kristen. I have a plan. But I have to be alone.

## What plan?
You don't want to know. Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.

## That's not true, Mr...?
Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim.

## Where is she? Where is the girl?
She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.

## Where does he hang out?
I don't know.

## Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
No.

## What you got in mind?
I want to meet Ratan.

## You're talking about real excitement?
Yeah. I heard you and Ratan just came from Mexico. And that you had a film of a girl being, ah you know...

## Who told you about this?
Rucker.

## Um-hm. You got the five hundred?
Well...

## What do you want? Do I know you from somewhere?
I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you.

## Who?
That film was a fake! Everything's phony...

## What?
It's fifty cents admission. It's applicable to a purchase.

## They're all about the same. You want something?
This is from the movie I was talking about.

## I'm just trying to find... Who owns this store?
I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.

## You don't want anything for your fifty cents?
No.

## In other words, you want to get laid?
Not exactly...

## I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.

## Cool off, huh? How's this for cooling off?
Hold it, mister.

## He asked me. You going with anybody?
I don't know.

## You never heard of that?
Com'on, tell me.

## What does that do?
Well, each time he comes in closer, like this.

## Do you really think Kristen is just a runaway?
Maybe. Maybe not.

## To his own daughter?
To anybody.

## You know Granville's looking for you, Niki?
My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.

## Who's that?
The guy who bought you that ring.

## Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job?
Jake'll take care of me.

## At least I improved myself. What's up?
I want you to take a look at this girl here. She's been in some porn stuff.

## You working in San Diego now?
I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.

## Was he with a girl?
No.

## You are at the University, Candy?
Yes, I am.

## And what are you studying?
Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.

## Eh, Poli Sci?
Political Science. It's all about what's going on.

## Yes, that's good planning. Tell me, are you a regular, Candy, in this computer club?
I think I should mention, Candy, that Harold does have his eccentric moments.

## Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
Yes.

## How long have you been driving?
About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck.

## Isn't this your vehicle?
No, no. I just took it.

## Took it?
Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.

## Haven't we met before?
None of that, lady.

## Is this your shovel?
No.

## Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?
Check.

## And that truck - is it registered in your name?
Oh no! Not in my name.

## I suppose they are in the truck. Are you going to take a lot of time with this?
Wait here.

## What kind of a car is it?
Oh. It looks like a hearse. Very nice. Compact.

## Edith, I'd like you to meet my son, Harold. Harold, this is Edith... eh?
Fern. I'm very pleased to make your acquaintance.

## And what do you do, my dear?
I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.

## Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?
Edith was just telling me about her job.

## What do you want?
I'm sorry. I was looking for Maude.

## A rather free translation but nonetheless correct. Greetings to you too, my little one. Tell me, what do you see?
A block of ice.

## What do you see?
I see the eternal goddess of beauty and love. I see Aphrodite. The consummate woman.

## You're welcome. Did you know him?
Eh, no.

## Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
I don't know.

## Oh, of course. What is your name?
Harold Chasen.

## Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?
No, thank you. I have my car.

## Do you sing and dance?
Eh, no.

## Well, it's a new experience for me. Good on curves. Shall I take you home, Harold?
But this is my car.

## Oh.
Your hearse?

## And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
Not any car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.

## Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.

## But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?
No.

## Oh, at the dentist's?
Sort of.

## How about some ginger pie?
Eh, fine.

## I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
Oh, it's fine. Fine.

## Do you often model for Glaucus?
Me! No. Of course not.

## Really. Do you think it's wrong?
No.

## A self-portrait. But over here is my favorite. It's titled \"Rainbow with Egg Underneath and an Elephant.\" Do you like it?
Yes. Very much.

## What do you think?
Oh. Eh, I like it.

## Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
You don't look eighty.

## I should like to change into a sunflower most of all. They are so tall and simple. And you, Harold, what flower would you like to be?
I don't know. Just one of those.

## Why do you say that?
Because they are all the same.

## The universal language of mankind. What music do you like, Harold?
Well...

## What happened?
Look.

## What?
Over there by the courthouse.

## What is it?
That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.

## But what?
But this is public property.

## Don't you think we should get some tools, maybe?
Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.

## Is he all right?
He's fallen asleep, as usual.

## What is that he's working on?
An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.

## A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?
Well, I really don't drink...

## What were you fighting for?
No.

## Okay?
Superb.

## Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
Why? There'll be a new block of ice in the morning.

## Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?
Well -- - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.

## What was that?
Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming. Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.

## Well, it's a question of timing, and the right equipment, and plenty of patience... You really want to hear about this?
Of course.

## Maude, do you pray?
Pray? No. I communicate.

## With God?
With Life.

## Well, why don't you?
No. I'd feel stupid.

## Want to join me in some cartwheels?
No. I feel more like - yodeling.

## Where's that?
From the guys who got the matches, of course.

## What is it, Harold?
They're going to draft me. In the Army. I'm going to be sent away.

## Maude, do you think you can help me?
What? With your skill and my experience... I think we can come up with something.

## Traitor! Benedict Arnold! Remember Nathan Hale, right, sir?
Don't you advance on me.

## How about some candy floss?
Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.

## Do you think there is any life up there?
I don't know. Perhaps.

## Why are there no photographs in these frames?
I took them out.

## Why?
I'll never forget you, Maude. But I would like a photo of you.

## Farewell?
Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.

## But you're not going anywhere, are you?
Oh yes, dear. I took the pills an hour ago. I should be gone by midnight.

## But why now?
I thought eighty was a good round number.

## Not now, Harold... You can't put me down for Monday?
Mother.

## Fay, I'll call you back. What did you say?
I'm getting married.

## To whom?
To a girl. Here.

## Love? Love? What do you know about her? Where does she come from? Where did you meet her?
At a funeral.

## How do you do?
Can't complain.

## Would you like a cigarette?
No, thank you. They stain my fingers.

## No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
Oh, I studied the guitar. I had to give it up. Gave me calluses on my fingers. As an actress I can't afford to have a tarnished instrument.

## Oh, is this your father?
No. My uncle.

## Ohhh. What's hari-kari?
An ancient Japanese ceremony.

## Like a tea ceremony?
No. Like this.

## Tell me, Harold, how many of these, eh, suicides have you performed?
An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.

## And why is that?
Just give me a rough estimate.

## No, I suppose not. How do you feel about your mother?
I don't think I'm getting through to Mother like I used to.

## Does that worry you?
Yes. It does.

## Why?
I put a lot of effort into these things.

## I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
No.

## What about the draft?
My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.

## Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
You mean when I'm not working on a...

## I see. Junkyards. What is the fascination there?
I don't know.

## Is it the machines? The noise? The people?
No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.

## What else do you like?
I go to funerals.

## You don't seem to be listening. I asked do you have any friends?
No.

## None at all?
Well, maybe one.

## Would you care to talk about this friend?
No.

## Is this a friend you had when you were away at school?
No.

## I see. Were you happy at school, Harold?
Yes.

## You liked your teachers?
Yes.

## Your classmates?
Yes.

## Your studies?
Yes.

## Then why did you leave?
I burnt down the Chemistry building.

## I see. Tell me, Harold, do you remember your father at all?
No. I'd have liked to.

## Why?
I'd have liked to talk to him.

## What would you say?
I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.

## What kind of stuff?
Good idea of yours to come out here, Harold. It's a lovely spot.

## You think so, sir?
Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.

## How about hand-to-hand combat?
Yes.

## How about to slit his throat?
Well, I don't...

## Souvenirs?
Boy, to think I could maybe make my own.

## Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.

## Tell me -- -- is that car parked all right?
Oh yes. That's fine.

## Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
Yes.

## Oh, yes. How did you like that?
Well, I didn't.

## Perhaps you're teasing us. Are you teasing us?
It's different for us.

## You knew?
Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.

## Yes... Yes. You look...
Oh, right. Daddy's died and gone to heaven, eh?

## Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
No. You look...

## You a doctor, too?
Sad, huh? She's been here six months. Her name's TIFFANY.

## What's the matter with her?
Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.

## No bad dreams.
What?

## So you slept O.K.?
Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on...

## And you're sure it was a woman?
God, I wish I could say no. This is going to do terrible things to my attitude, you know.

## What?
The Boxes. In the House. I told you.

## What do you mean?
The boxes! I TOLD you.

## Kyle, you don't have...
Are you crazy?

## I KNOW I don't have to. It's just my time of the month to be a complete fucking idiot. O.K.?
I have to go back. Or it'll never stop.

## Finish what?
I'm scared.

## Go on. But trick us again, child, and your suffering will be legendary even in Hell.
And what about you?

## What is this? Someone else you think escaped us, like Frank?
Steve...

## What are you talking about? Who are you?
Oh, excuse me...

## He talked about Demons, huh?
Yeah.

## Who?
The Cenobites.

## See what?
The past, the future, whatever this object holds.

## Is he serious?
Don't worry about fingerprints. I never had any.

## Oooh!! Who was here? Nixon? Houdini? You mind sharing your mystic insights?
Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One sheet of glass between them and us.

## Oh -- you don't wanna know what I think. Topside, now.
Red. How long was it latched onto you?

## What is it?
In private, if you don't mind...

## You are a Catholic?
Amongst other things, yes -- but that's hardly the point.

## Air and sea backup. What's closest?
Cordon off the area. Something came through.

## C'mon -- Rasputin?
No. It was red. Bright red.

## Oh, as opposed to -- ?
They took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank.

## How does he know so much about me?
Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe. \"Unique.\" That's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here.

## On the desk, yes. In Latin.
Where am I -- exactly, Sir?

## 1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?

## Did he, now?
Agent Myers is your new liaison.

## Got tired of me?
Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field.

## \"Myers\", huh? You have a first name?
Try not to stare. He hates when people stare.

## Yup. Sixty years old by our count. But he doesn't age like we do -- think dog years, He's barely out of his teens.
Grounded? Who's grounded?

## Ah, I see. That makes it all alright then.
Uh-oh -- John. Staring at what?

## No, it doesn't make it right, but I stopped that creature, didn't I?
That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight. You know monsters.

## What are you trying to say?
In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left, you.

## You call that thing a cigar?
Yup.

## No one ever helps me. It's my job.
Father's back? Still angry?

## My arm is fine. Where are you?
Goodbye.

## What took you so long?
C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.

## What are you, a Boy Scout?
No. I never was.

## You want me to hold him down?
That's right, Stud, hold me down.

## I think I can help -- Talk to her -- I can bring her back.
Down there. Did you ever loose track of him?

## What was that?
Hostage negotiations.

## Are you sure about this?
On a scale of one to ten, two. But -- -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one.

## How big can it be?
For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.

## You're going alone?
No. Myers is taking me.

## It's freezing, isn't it?
Coffee's warming me up.

## What -- ?
That you feel that way about me.

## -- Section fifty-one. Step back.
What?

## Pardon?
Two steps back, please.

## Look, do you want the bed in or not?
Just take it slowly.

## Want to buy a bed?
Not much.

## What's happening?
We're leaving.

## Will you sign for the bed?
Sure.

## That your daughter?
Uh-huh.

## Damn right. Now are we going to move the bed or not?
The box... you opened it. We came.

## Who are you?
No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering.

## You did this before, right?
Many times.

## To a man called Frank Cotton?
Nobody escapes us.

## Suppose he HAD slipped us. What significance has that?
Kirsty. It's Frank. It's Uncle Frank.

## You want it?
Come to Daddy.

## That's right. Who are you?
I'm brother Frank.

## There is going to BE a wedding?
Oh. Oh yes.

## Well can I come in or not?
I'm sorry. Of course. You're very welcome.

## Well?
I don't want to see the dress.

## Wedded bliss?
I'm very happy.

## Who are you?
I said, don't look.

## What happened to you?
His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.

## -- to heal me completely. Then we can be away from here, before they come looking.
Back from where?

## Who?
The Cenobites. It's only a matter of time before they find I've slipped them. I have to get away from here.

## Better. Very much better. I'd like something to wear. And some cigarettes. Will you bring me some?
Later.

## What?
I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.

## A box?
It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.

## What kind of doors?
Hell...

## Who did?
You're still afraid.

## It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes?
Yes. They'll never find us.

## So where's the harm?
I said no.

## Don't you care?
There's very little I can do about it.

## Which is where?
Just to your left.

## What happened?
Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches.

## What's the problem?
I have to see my father.

## You look terrible. Have you had an accident?
I was here this afternoon.

## Maybe somebody changed the lock.
I'm sorry, I don't follow. What was there to see?

## It's just been empty a while.
Like who?

## How long since you were here?
The best part of ten years.

## Why didn't he want to sell it?
I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.

## I thought half of it was your brother's?
He won't complain. He can pay off some of his creditors.

## You mean we're moving in?
You're still blaming me.

## So what's the argument?
No argument.

## Where are you?
In here.

## He's here?
He's BEEN here. There's stuff in the kitchen. He must have made a hasty exit.

## Why not?
We'll move in Sunday.

## How are you doing through there?
It looks like a bomb's dropped.

## What have you done?
I cut myself.

## Is it deep?
I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood.

## Julia?
I'm here.

## Are you all right?
Just feeling a bit sick.

## Can I get you anything?
Maybe a brandy.

## Just a moment. Put on some music will you babe?
O.K.

## Who was it?
Kirsty.

## Is this upsetting you?
I've seen worse.

## Are you all right?
Fine.

## What's wrong with you?
Oh baby.

## Huh?
Please...

## What's wrong with you?
Please. I can't bear it...

## What's wrong?
I don't know where to begin...

## What?
Drinking alone.

## What are you drinking?
Just soda.

## Plain soda?
Please.

## Oh?
You know it's not often I... you know...

## You want something to drink?
I'm already way over my usual limit. You know, it's funny. I feel like I've known you for years.

## Well, isn't it?
I... suppose so, yes.

## So, what's your problem? Let's get to it. You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
No. No. Let's go upstairs.

## Do you care ?
No, not much.

## No personal details?
That's right.

## We don't need a bed, do we?
I suppose not.

## Why don't you do the same?
Maybe I will.

## Am I?
You know you are. Loveliest woman I ever set eyes on.

## What's wrong?
Too much drink. Better empty my bladder.

## What happened to me?
I won't be a moment.

## Try me.
I called another friend of mine and he's coming over. Will you let him in?

## Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name?
Steve.

## Kirsty?
I got through.

## Where are you?
I found a room.

## What did you say?
I said, I found a room.

## I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile?
No Dad.

## Do you want me to come over?
Well I want you to see the house.

## Well come over, will you? See the place?
I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us.

## I'll come over and see you in the next few days. You can show me the mansion. O.K.?
You will keep in touch.

## You like?
Me like.

## Is Julia here?
Upstairs. Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving.

## Are you O.K.?
Sure.

## What are you drinking, love?
I've forgotten.

## Steve?
I just wanted to be sure you were O.K.

## You don't like her at all do you?
She doesn't even want to leave the house.

## Really?
It's like she's waiting for something.

## What?
I don't know. I don't know. It's beyond me.

## Finished?
He's gone.

## Gone?
Poor Frank. He's better off dead.

## What's the problem?
I have to get out.

## You're not going?
Just upstairs.

## Need any help?
I AM house-trained.

## Please. I want to see you home. All right?
All right. No. That's nice.

## What do we do if there isn't?
We walk.

## Meaning what?
Oh, I don't know. Up-tight. Frigid.

## There ya go. I beg your pardon?
We're not all frigid.

## Oh no?
I've been better.

## Are you busy after work ?
Just trying to get my apartment in order.

## Steve. Thank God you came.
Can I lend you a hand?

## I won't let anybody take you.
What happened to you?

## Sure. Why not?
Bye.

## Do I know you?
I don't know.

## I beg your pardon?
Technically, I'm number one. I went out with her a week before Kevin did. Her first boyfriend. Me.

## What are you doing?
I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.

## What's next?
Since you brought that bullshit tape in.

## Well what's the point in that?
Nice, Barry.

## Oh, so what's the point then?
I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.

## \"Our customers?\" You think that Mr. L.L. Bean out there is going to be a regular?
Barry, I'm fucking broke! I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.

## What did he ever do to you?
He offended me with his terrible taste.

## What did you tell her about the shop for?
We're only on the fucking list for Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's all! All three of us.

## What are you snickering about?
I'm not snickering. I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.

## What am I missing? What do you have to be happy about?
Okay. Top five side one track ones. Number one... \"Janie Jones,\" the Clash, from The Clash.

## Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all. Dick, did you hear that?
Shut up. \"Let's Get It On,\" Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. \"Airbag,\" Radiohead, from OK Computer.

## Just... come on, what would it mean to you? That sentence? \"I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet?\"
-- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit --

## Yeah, yeah, I know. But say I hadn't seen it and I said to you, \"I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet,\" what would you think?
I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you.

## Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
Well... you couldn't have been desperate to see it, otherwise you'd have already gone...

## But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
How the fuck am I supposed to know that? You might get sick of people telling you you've really gotta go see the movie.

## Why would they care?
Because it's a brilliant film. It's funny, violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass.

## I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
Let's pack it up. We haven't had a customer in four hours.

## How do you know about that?
Shut the fuck up, Barry.

## What the fuck is that?
My band.

## What band?
The band that found me and asked me to join.

## Barrytown. Barrytown? Is there no end to your arrogance?
I didn't make up the name. It's the Steely Dan song. And it was in The Commitments.

## Great! That's fucking great! They only asked you to sing because of your name! You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
That's why you got the gig, isn't it?

## So much for friends, then. You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?
Bitter? Because I'm not in Barrytown? You should be shot like a lame horse, you jerk. Just keep that out of my window.

## What's up?
Laura. Her dad died.

## What?
I heard you, man. Don't give me that \"what\" shit. You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them.

## HELLO. DO YOU SEE ANYONE ELSE around here with a band, Mr. Branson? Mr. Phil Spector?
Like fuck you are.

## I'm looking for a record for my daughter. For her birthday. \"I Just Called To Say I Love You.\" Do you have it?
Oh yeah. We got it.

## Great. Can I have it then?
No, you can't.

## Why not?
What's your problem? What did I... Why are you --

## Oh really. Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain?
They always seemed...

## That is perverse. Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde. What about Television?
No. The Righteous Brothers.

## What?
Nothing.

## No, not nothing. What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?
Nothing. I just prefer the other one.

## Who are you going to see?
Nobody.

## Oh, hi.
Anna who? Anna Green Gables? Anna Conda?

## May I help you?
I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.

## Right. Why?
Oh. Okay.

## So. Is now a good time?
Right. So. You must have an enormous record collection.

## Pardon me?
Your desert island top-five.

## Is there a difference?
Nevermind. Any five. So four more.

## Can I go home and work this out and let you know? In a week or so?
Look if you can't think of anything, it doesn't matter. I'll do one. My five favorite from the old days at the Dodger.

## Is that it?
Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.

## Yeah.
Sure, but is that it for the list?

## What's his name?
Who? Oh. My friend. My friend is Laura. A girl. A friend who's a girl.

## Okay. \"Dance Music For Old People?\"
\"Music for Old People.\" What does that mean?

## Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what? Why don't I just make you a tape?
Would you? Really? Wow. I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home.

## Yeah. A billion. Right... How are you?
Uh...yes, at the moment.

## Why did you break up with me for Marco?
Fuck! I knew it! You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.

## Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
Oh God, no. I didn't want to hurt his feelings.

## Good weekend?
Great.

## Are you all right?
Yeah. I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up. She's gone. And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.

## Sure. 'Course. Rob, look. Do you want to... talk about it, that kind of thing?
I always hated this song.

## You're a horrible person, Barry. I mean it.
Liz, hold on a second -- What?

## Can I do anything?
\"Abraham, Martin, and John.\" That's a nice one.

## Laura? Are you okay?
I am fine... I gotta go. Goodbye.

## Can I help you?
Hello, Rob. Remember me? I'm Ray. Ian.

## What needs sorting out?
Come on, Rob. My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.

## Good. So shall we leave it at that then?
I dunno.

## Good. So shall we leave it at that then?
I've already left it, you pathetic rebound fuck! Now get your patchouli stink out of my store.

## Good. So shall we leave it at that then?
We won't leave it, Ian. Not ever.

## So shall we leave it at that then?
I dunno.

## Are you coming home?
Yes. Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.

## My house?
How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye? It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians.

## But don't you remember?
I remember the song. I just couldn't remember who sang it.

## And do you like it that way?
Not really.

## So. Where have you been staying for the last week?
I think you know that.

## Good. So. Is it my job?
What? Gimme a fucking break. Is that what you think? That your not big enough a deal for me? Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.

## What were the others?
Just the obvious stuff.

## What's the obvious stuff?
I don't know.

## No. So. Is it working out with Ian?
Rob. Don't be childish.

## So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me? There's still a chance we'll get back together?
I don't know.

## Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?
Of course it is.

## You really think it would make a difference either way?
I don't know.

## Never?
I haven't felt like it.

## But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.

## I'll look for 'em. How you doing?
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...

## Have you slept with him yet?
I guess.

## Oh, Rob. What do you want me to say?
I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.

## Will you call me?
I don't have your number.

## I figured it was. Where are you?
I'm not -- hold on...

## Are you still in love with me?
Jesus. I do not know. I'll talk to you later.

## You don't ever think about other people?
No... not really... I mean, I think about it... but no, I don't really think about it.

## Is that the last of it?
Yep. I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.

## Those look heavy. Where's Ian?
It was kind of funny.

## You still together? Going all right?
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.

## That bad, eh?
You know what I mean.

## I'm sorry, but can we get this straight? What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray? What do you call him?
Ray. I hate Ian.

## Guess who I just saw, right by my store? Ian. In Starbuck's. Neat, huh?
I can't talk right now.

## Are you alright?
Pigsty.

## Who the fuck's Pig?
My dad died. My dad, my dad.

## No, no. When are you going home?
In a minute. When I get it together.

## Do you want me to be there?
I don't care. As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.

## Look, are you coming or not?
Yes, of course.

## Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?
Uh... No.

## What do you mean?
I didn't mess things up because I was scared. I slept with Ray because I was sick of you. And I needed something to snap me out of it.

## What do you want to do?
C'mon.

## What?
I've only got a couple left. I'm saving them for later.

## No, no. It's not... are you still on the pill?
Yes, of course. There's nothing to worry about.

## I didn't mean that. I mean... was that all you used?
Look, we can do other things.

## What about Ian?
Mission accomplished.

## Let's go home. Okay?
Okay.

## Want to know what, exactly?
What it was like.

## What's the difference?
You know the difference.

## Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
To make you feel better.

## How? How were we the same people?
No, but...

## But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...

## Less neurotic. Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
I'm alright.

## All I'm saying is, you have to allow for things to happen to people, most of all to yourself. Otherwise, what's the use?
No use.

## Hi. What are you doing?
Nothing.

## WHAT?
Just local, of course.

## That's not the point. I mean, what if the single isn't done in time?
Barry said its done.

## Barry? Barry knows about this?
Yeah. His band is playing a set.

## Are you worried about tomorrow night?
Not really.

## Are you going to talk to me, or shall I get my paper out?
I'm going to talk to you.

## What are you going to talk to me about?
I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not. To me.

## I'm sorry. But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?
Not in love, exactly, but...

## Would you marry me if I was?
No. Probably not.

## Don't sulk. What brought all this on?
I don't know.

## Are you persuadable?
Fair enough.

## So?
I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.

## About what?
This stuff. Love and marriage. I want to think about something else.

## I mean, maybe you're right. But were you really expecting me to say yes?
I dunno. Didn't think about it, really. It was the asking that was the important thing.

## You called this morning?
Yeah. I just wanted to thank you for that message last night. It made me feel like... like less of an asshole.

## So the minister says nice things, and then, what, we all troop outside and they bury him?
It's a crematorium.

## Isn't that how it is for everybody?
Enough, Liz.

## Only because it's never the time. I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
If by \"we\" you are referring to men, then I have to say that just the once would do.

## So you live in Chicago now?
Yup. Not far from here, actually.

## Don't you like that?
No, no, I love, it's just, thinking you're, you must be so sick of it... Well.

## Everything go alright?
She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing. A relief, actually.

## Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place? Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff?
Yup.

## You share a place with T-Bone?
I understand completely.

## Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it?
For now. But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.

## Good. In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink. You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?
Whiskey.

## So you'll stay?
Yeah.

## Would you like me to turn the lights out? Or would you like them on?
God, you ask a lot of questions.

## That way. You?
That way.

## Yeah?
Hi, Rob. It's your mother.

## Everything all right?
Great. Super-fantastic.

## How's the store?
So so. Up and down.

## What do you mean? Where did she go?
How would I know? Gone. Girlfriend. Leave. Not say where gone. Laura move out.

## Hello? Anybody there?
I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.

## I knew this would happen. What are you going to do Rob?
I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed. Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.

## And after that?
Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.

## What did Laura say? Do you know why she left?
It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.

## What do you think?
It's the best collection I've ever seen.

## And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?
It must have taken him a long time to get them together.

## Can I buy this Otis Redding single off you?
Sure. Ten cents.

## Oh really. You two are slamming to Nico now?
I think you have more.

## Records are those big round black things, right?
Fuck off.

## What's the name of your label?
Maybe he's hiding from something.

## How old is Richard?
P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.

## Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran picked up the other night?
Yeah.

## Doesn't have a head, does he?
This one came unassembled.

## Huh?
Scottish claymore. Take a French epee, add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business, and you've got a claymore.

## Would you like more tea?
No thank you, I'm fine.

## Why?
Then you didn't know Richard later on.

## The boy _died_?
Mother too. Sad case it was. The young lady just couldn't make it through labor. Never even saw her son.

## Have you spoken to anyone else about this?
There was this one fella. Asked a lot of questions. I was out of town but I heard he spent near a full day in the records office.

## Would you remember his name?
Carl Smith.

## Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
Anything in Maryland is close.

## Do you play?
Yes.

## Miss Cartwright, what is it I can do for you?
I'd like to ask you about the claymore.

## Byzantine?
Basil the II.

## Grave robbers?
Probably.

## Who?
People like that rarely leave business cards.

## Does Carl Smith?
I don't know what you're talking about.

## Why not?
Tradition.

## What the hell is going on?
He tried to kill me last night.

## Where?
Dupont Circle.

## Who is he?
At the moment? Carl Smith.

## What will you do now?
You needn't worry Miss Cartwright. I've been at this a very long time.

## That bothers you?
He was innocent.

## You?
I'm a witness to a murder. That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.

## Have you gone to the police?
No.

## Are you?
No.

## No one knows you're here?
No. I had to talk to you.

## Is this what you killed them with?
You've been listening to rumors.

## What's all that?
Richard Taupin has become cumbersome. It would be best if he just disappeared.

## When you finish, what then?
I go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad Mr. Taupin.

## No. So what now? We just wait?
Yes.

## And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
Yes.

## Why are you here?
I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write. But it's not. It's you.

## Who are you?
That would be difficult to explain.

## What about that family in '31?
Sometimes innocents become involved.

## You kill with your left hand?
I haven't killed _you_.

## Is that a threat?
Don't.

## What is it like? Being you?
But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.

## What is it you want?
All of it finished.

## Will I see you again?
Be careful. Don't stay any longer than you have to.

## I'll destroy you. I've destroyed everything I've ever touched! Oh God...
What's wrong?

## The emptyness. The years and years of void. Nothingness. Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed?
The inheritance.

## Don't they have enough for you to do at the castle?
Thanks.

## What do you want from me?
I'm calling an attorney.

## Four?
All fashionably without heads.

## What are you getting at, Moran?
It'll never stick.

## What were you doing in Felton?
Research. If your pal was there I never saw him.

## It's that important?
Yeah.

## Who is it?
Not who. What. Worstick's a town in Pennsylvania.

## Why?
He's too cool. Too sharp. I think he's got something to do with it.

## I've seen nobleman swords that weren't as well preserved. It's just a hunk of peasant iron. Why would he be carrying it around in an alley?
Someone should check him out. Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over. He has one, he might have two.

## Afternoon.
You see that desk? _Your_ desk? You see the crap piled up on it?

## Your name is Conor?
Aye.

## Your back, it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle?
Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing I cannot even re- member.

## And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?
Aye.

## How can you know this?
First food, no? A good meal makes conversation so much easier.

## Hmm, que rico. What is it you call this?
Pheasant.

## Why are you here?
I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal.

## Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
Yes. Always.

## Does it change with me in the room?
It is less.

## What?
We are immortal.

## What is to become of me? Am I to wander the Earth forever like a ghost?
You will live. Survive.

## You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less?
Aye.

## How can I stop such a man?
Hide. Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn. You must learn to defend yourself. In this I can help.

## Why?
We are brothers. And you are a defense- -of sorts.

## And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt?
The Fabric of life. The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another.

## And you?
I am a small player. But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something.

## I'm your future husband, remember?
I have no future husband.

## Who?
There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.

## That's mad. Surely you don't take their word?
I don't know, Conor. It's not natural. Maybe something has touched you.

## What would you like?
Something pretty.

## That's wonderful. Where did you ever learn it?
Far away.

## Who am I deceiving?
Certainly not me.

## Complete your inspection?
They're nothing but boys. It will be a slaughter tomorrow.

## Your name?
Mulet.

## What is your position?
Second musketeer.

## Equals?
If you wish to play games, Major.

## You are really going to force this, aren't you?
Either you are with me or against me.

## Have you time for some- thing to eat?
Your grandfather wore that in his service to the King, and I to fight for the Duke.

## Must he go?
Aye. It is his duty. All of ours.

## Where did you learn that?
My father taught me.

## Figure she's with him?
Yeah.

## Any other I.D.s come up?
Not yet. Called FBI yesterday. Thompson's going to try CIA this afternoon. Y'never know.

## Are you sure?
Round up who you can and put them on standby.

## Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
No. I want this to be all ours.

## What name is he using?
Smith. Carl Smith.

## How many came?
The last four.

## And the Bulgarian?
He got him. He always does. Eventually.

## He knows I'm here. How?
None of this would be happening if you hadn't run...

## Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night?
Sit.

## How are you?
Head still secure to the neck.

## How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime?
Old habits die hard. Waitress! A round of Nitzhic! Peasant drool, I know. But it's the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence.

## What are you doing here?
It is the gathering, my friend. The settling of old scores.

## And have you something to settle with me?
Not tonight. Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.

## How do you do it, Kahn? How do you live so full of life for so long?
Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have. All else is just marking time. You're marking time.

## Friend of yours?
Of sorts.

## What's the point?
This isn't done. Get up.

## Are you here?
I want you to come to me.

## And if I refuse?
Give me an address where I can forward Miss Cart- wright's head.

## This your present address?
Yes.

## Mr.- Taupin, what were you doing in that alley?
I was walking by when I heard a shout. Your men came right after.

## Did you know the victim?
No.

## Two days ago a Bulgarian national was murdered the same way. He'd also been in the country less than a week. What is your citizenship?
American.

## What are you getting at?
Let's just say that in my years with this department I've seen more than one well dressed business man look for a hand job on 14th Street.

## What were _you_ looking for?
That's none of your business.

## Do you know what this is?
I presume it's a sword.

## Your murder weapon?
It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood.

## Where were you Tuesday night?
Home.

## Do you?
All I need is time.

## The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs?
Oh yes, more than enough.

## You're one of William's kids, huh?
His only kid.

## When may I expect the cleaners?
I'll send them right up.

## Why don't you fellows get your own news?
This is Murphy. More slop on the hanging.

## Are you back?
No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for myself.

## What doing?
I was having a little chat about you just this afternoon -- with our Mister Duffy.

## Duffy! I'm sending Bensinger over to see you. Mervyn, isn't it?
No. Roy. Roy V.

## I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.

## Too hot?
No. It's strong. But I like it that way.

## Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.

## But --
I could get a company doctor in twenty minutes.

## Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?
The five hundred? Sure.

## Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?
Certified and everything. Got it right here in my wallet... What? No, he's not here -- I'm in a phone booth.

## All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?
Fine. And here's a kiss for you.

## What's the matter?
I lost my wallet.

## Yes, wasn't it?
I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.

## Oh, no. How could you ever think of such a thing?
The Criminal Courts Building.

## BRUCE!! How'd you get out?
Not through any help of yours, Hildy.

## Where'd she go?
Out some place.

## Hildy! Where's mother?
Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.

## Did you give her the money?
This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and I'm sorry about the mistake.

## Oh.
Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.

## But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?
Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.

## Where are we going? I'm going to buy you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell you?
Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.

## Well, I'll try to give her one.
Taking the train today -- and being married tomorrow?

## I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
Just for the first year.

## How's business, Bruce?
Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life.

## Anything the matter?
Just Sweeney again. One of my best reporters.

## Just what is the lowdown on Williams?
It's simple. A poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down.

## Are you sure Williams is not all there?
All you've got to do is talk to him. But the Mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected.

## How long would the interview take?
Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.

## Well, I got to get back. You can find your way out, can't you?
No -- I was just talking to one of the guys at the office.

## The money? Why?
There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.

## Gee! Take a look, will you?
You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of.

## No? Well -- Johnson, you're under arrest. You, too, Burns.
You'll ask me to what?

## Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.

## We'll just start by impounding the Post property. Is that your desk?
Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars.

## Do you want to get us scooped?
You're going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we're pulling your nose out of the feed bag.

## Out of the mouths of babes.
What's this?

## What do you want?
Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.

## Maybe it was yesterday. Been seeing me in your dreams?
No -- Mama doesn't dream about you any more, Walter. You wouldn't know the old girl now.

## Done what?
Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.

## Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.

## You've had a better offer, eh?
You bet I've got a better offer.

## What's the matter?
Sweeney.

## I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.
Dead?

## Bermuda... Rich, eh?
Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.

## What's his line?
He's in the insurance business.

## It's a good, honest business, isn't it?
Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.

## He does, does he? How did I treat you -- like a water buffalo?
I don't know about water buffaloes, but I know about him. He's kind and sweet and considerate. He wants a home -- and children.

## Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?
Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.

## Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you. So long, Walter, and better luck next time.

## Say, could I meet him?
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.

## All right then, come on and let's see this paragon. Is he as good as you say?
Better.

## Then what does he want with you?
Now you got me.

## No kidding?
And he takes his hat off when he's with a lady.

## Thank you.
What for?

## What now?
You said it.

## If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.

## What do you mean?
I happen to know Sweeney was married only three months ago. If he's got twins this morning, I claim it was done with mirrors.

## All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
Exclusive? That's great.

## No kidding, Hildy. Say, this isn't a rib?
That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes.

## Yes. Where is he?
She jumped out of the window.

## We're going to take him over to my private office. Where's our phone?
All the words you've got.

## Where's Bruce?
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.

## What tickets?
Railroad tickets.

## Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?
Hildy, you think I could? After this story? Here! You're just nervous.

## Was she? Did you notice?
It's Fate, Hildy. What will be, will be.

## Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?

## Who? Hello, Butch! Where are you?
Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.

## Shut up, will you? You sure? Nobody?
Duffy!!!! Duffy!!!! Well, where is Duffy? Diabetes! I ought to know better than to hire anybody with a disease. Louie.

## Ring that number, will you?
Which ought to be about three hours more, I'd say.

## Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well, it's been a lot of fun.

## Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
I don't know what to do, Walter.

## No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.
All right. Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?

## On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
Sure.

## What would you do if it was a daughter?
Well, if she looked like you -- Say! My brains and your looks -- that mightn't be such a bad combination.

## What's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist? Look, Hildy, I'm proposing to you. What do you say?
That's what he said the last time. Don't believe him, Judge.

## Louie, take this lady over to Polack Mike's and lock her up. See that she doesn't take to anyone on the way.
How about Bruce's?

## Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
What's that -- what's that?

## I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?
You stay here. I'll find out everything.

## Who do you want?
You know me. The shirt off my back.

## You got plenty of money?
He's on my phone. He just called me.

## I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
No more interviews. Besides, a doctor's coming over.

## Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?
It's a deal. Let me up.

## First we talk. How did Earl Williams get that gun?
The newspapers! Sheriff, they're the scum of modern civilization.

## Of course, I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here. You don't mind?
Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.

## You know you are to be executed, Mr. Williams. Who do you feel is responsible for that?
The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.

## I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime?
In a legal sense, yes. But not actually. Actually, I'm innocent. I didn't do anything.

## Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun?
Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.

## Three bullets! Any good?
Beats king up.

## Kind of exclusive, ain't you? We got calls to make, you know.
Who locked the door?

## Mollie Malloy -- what happened to her?
Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come to.

## Give me a hand with her, will you?
Okay. Up you go, Mollie.

## What have you got, Hildy?
Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't around.

## Who's this guy she's gonna marry?
She says she's gonna write fiction.

## You guys wanna play some more poker?
What's the use? I can't win a pot.

## Boy, did you see her go?
Oh, you two are pals now -- I think you're right, Endicott. Mollie did give her some kind of story.

## Where is he, before we beat it out of you?
Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree.

## Three sixes. Is that any good?
We know what you're up to.

## How's everything, Gus?
I can't complain.

## Little rum in yours, too?
I guess so.

## Just coffee. And you, sir?
Same way you did. Through that gate.

## Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go ahead, run it. And you can say I treated him well, too. 'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?
All right, boys. Take her along. I got ways of making her talk.

## Where'd you get this?
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.

## What?
With a bag of marshmallows.

## Where is he?
Where he used to live. You can catch the Riot Squad -- it's just going out.

## I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?
You're certainly a hard fellow to find, Sheriff.

## For who?
Earl Williams. The reprieve.

## Pete, I've got a mighty unpleasant task to perf --
Did you actually give Williams that gun?

## Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt this administration?
I'm getting them for twelve dollars a night.

## Twelve dollars! -- For those rheumatic uncles of yours? Out shooting everybody they see for the fun of it?
We'll fix that, too.

## What?
Shoot to kill, I said.

## Who is this man?
Throw him out, Frank.

## That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
I won't.

## Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging?
I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued.

## Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
I can't.

## You can let him out on bail, can't you?
Five hundred dollars.

## My name is Louis Peluso.
Editorials?

## What did you do with her?
Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.

## -- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
Was I? The driver got knocked cold.

## Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.
Who is it?

## What's the matter? Getting yellow?
Yeah. I was never so tired in my life.

## Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
Nothing doing. I'm playing for keeps.

## Say, I've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that. Where'd you get it?
I made it up just now, and who's asking you? I know it's silly, honey, but do it for me, won't you?... Yes, right now.

## No -- what?
If Walter Burns calls, hold the wire for me, will you? I'll be right back.

## Where's the money?
Keep your shirt on. I got it -- right here. One hundred -- two hundred -- three hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty. Now sign.

## Kings and sixes The pot affixes'... Poetry. I learned that at my grandma's knee.
No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?

## Any dope yet on how he got out?
From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.

## I couldn't plead insanity, because you see I'm just as sane as anybody else.
Hiding him where?

## How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?
\"Production for use only.\" Well, maybe that's the answer.

## Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
Very simple, Earl.

## No, Earl, not at all. Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.

## Yes. Isn't she beautiful?
Don't forget about production for use.

## Don't talk too loud.
Earl, you don't want to hurt your friends, do you?

## Down the drainpipe. I didn't mean to shoot him. You believe me, don't you, Mollie?
Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk. I'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back.

## What good'll it do?
Wait a minute, Mollie.

## What's the idea?
Yeah, I'm feelin' fine.

## What do you want?
I'm a messenger at the State House. This is from the Governor.

## What's from the Governor?
Forty dollars.

## Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.
Who? Me?

## Why not?
I couldn't work in the city. You see, I've got my family in the country.

## For heaven's sake, why not?
This puts me in a peculiar hole.

## Come in and see me in my office tomorrow. What's your name?
Sure, Mollie, you never looked better in your life.

## What's your hurry?
We want to see you.

## What's he want?
Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited.

## What's that?
Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.

## Can I try?
Put your hand on mine, get the knack of it.

## Why?
Your grandmother. She named them after virtues I lack. That's marriage for you.

## Grandpa, if you think of something hard enough, can you make it happen?
Apparently so.

## I know a secret.
Yes, she did, didn't she?

## What's that?
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.

## They're not.
Who told you that?

## You want to join our gang?
I don't mind.

## Do you know any swear words?
Yes.

## Won't they have maps?
They'll have to go to a shop to buy a map, stupid. Then they'll give zemselves avay viz ze vay zay tork.

## Who with?
Pauline.

## Can't we just see the end?
They've got the real thing outside.

## It's Canadian. Where'd you get it?
Well, I'm not having any. Even if it's not poisoned. I don't think it's right. It's not patriotic.

## You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?
Well, for the baby, really.

## What's that?
Big Berthas, shelling France. Twenty-five-mile range, they have.

## We will, you will, for the rest of our lives?
It was great for me, how was it for you.

## Well. Now we can do it slow. Are those some kind of stockings you're wearing?
They might be.

## Air-raid?
Didn't you feel the house rock? You must have seen all those shell bursts.

## What is it?
We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.

## I don't know?
You do, you do. You're just not saying.

## What about it?
Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.

## Why not?
You need trees for an avenue.

## How's your war, Mac?
Never done better. On the fiddle. Like everyone else.

## I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
There is all right. This Hitter fellow. We've got to winkle him out. And get shot of some of our lot at the same time.

## What's that?
You joined up.

## And what's that?
Jam.

## Well?
You taste it.

## You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?
That's it.

## Why didn't they say that before you started?
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.

## What are you going to be then?
A clerk. I'm doing a typing course. I'll be typing for England.

## When do you think you'll get leave again?
Not till Christmas, I don't suppose.

## Where to?
I've found a bungalow to rent up the towpath, Clive. I never want to leave the river again. The children have had such a wonderful summer.

## Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
After this dance.

## What would we do if a German came into the house?
Don't be silly, Dawn.

## Well, why do you always bring the carving knife in here?
Tell me the truth. You had to get married, didn't you? Because of me.

## And where do you think you're going?
Out.

## What is it, pet?
He's being posted. I was terrible to him.

## What did he say?
He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.

## Could we salt them, or smoke them, do you think?
Now take deep breaths, and push.

## Did they say how long it would take to get new ration books, Grace?
Up to six weeks, I think.

## Wasn't it lovely?
It was the best time of his life.

## I can't do it. What's the point?
It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.

## ...since I used to take you to the Proms?
That's right. Not since then Not since I got married.

## Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off with?
A Polish pilot. It's like one of those jokes on the wireless.

## Bless you, Mac. What would I have done without you?
You might still have a house.

## What did I do to deserve this?
You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.

## How long?
What can you do with four daughters, I asked myself, A string quartet was all I could come up with. They hated me for making them learn.

## I didn't mean it like that, Grace. Why does it always come out wrong?
I know you mean well.

## What?
Cone.

## Huh... what cone?
Any cone, yeah... I hate that word... sounds ugly, I don't like crumple either.

## What about R.J.?
Oh, he was already gone before I seen him... but Tiny saw him and said he said he was going out to the yard to get a new wheel.

## Enjoy your last night... ...where's Otis?
Oh, he's coming, he got something real special this year.

## Where's that?
Couple more miles up this road.

## What about the tree?
Oh yeah, the tree.

## Which way?
Go straight up about another mile... til we hit Cherrypicker Road and turn right... it ain't far from there.

## Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
Well, yeah, kind of.

## Is your brother ready to go?
Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.

## No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps a lot, now... do you want marshmallows?
Um, yeah sure, I guess.

## Hey, um... ...what kind of animal is that?
A dead one.

## Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
What? No, I'm was worried that... I was just wondering what's taking so long.

## Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and killed everbody?
That's not something to joke about.

## Can I help you with something?
I was just wondering.

## What?
You know... a couple of queers.

## Do you believe this fucking girl?
I was just wondering, cause you got a pissy look about you... like a real pussy licking bitch.

## What the hell are you laughing about?
I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.

## Why? You gonna do something about it?
Yeah, I'll do something.

## Now, what makes you think that?
You all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people.

## Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean?
Yeah, yeah... ...I like to fuck shit up.

## I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya... ...Goober?
Actually it's G. Ober... Gerry Ober, but the guys drew in the other O, fucking assholes.

## Great story Goober, how much?
Ummmm... two hundred and eighty-five dollars.

## What's this?
A missing girl. I use'ta go to school with her, she just up and disappeared some day... real weird.

## How long have you been running this place?
How long is a piece of string? Too God damn long, that's how long.

## The Duke?
Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head after that.

## You mean John Wayne?
Hell, boy there some other Duke you know about? A great American.

## I figured that much. Why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for?
I don't drive cross country.

## Better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?
If we're talking cute... like regular cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but cute ain't hot.

## How awesome?
Really fucking awesome.

## Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?
Hell yeah.

## I'm not exactly sure... it looks close. Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?
I don't know.

## What's that?
It's a hitchhiker.

## Way out here?
She looks like she stinks.

## What was that?
Fuck. I think we blew a tire.

## Oh, don't worry she didn't get offended by what I said. You two got to lighten up... right, Bill?
Whatever, at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking killer headache.

## Jesus, you think she was really gonna cut you?
I like sleep.

## Yeah, showtime for what?
Just grin and bear it.

## Should we stop?
We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area.

## Why are we stopping?
There's a dog in the road.

## What?
Fine. I'll go straight.

## How much is a person supposed to stand?
Quiet.

## Come on, get with the facts.
Oh, I'm sorry, bothering you? Was I disturbing your viewing pleasure?

## What'd you see, who was she with, where were they going?
Aw, she was with some nosey, smartass high-rise kids. They were poking around... asking stupid questions.

## What?
Yeah, doesn't hurt himself, just spins it around next to his eyeball.

## Can I get some stamps off ya? Did you fix the toilet yet?
Ya hear me? You bust that crapper and I'll beat your ass.

## Huh? Oh, hi. You really don't have a phone?
No, none. I had one once, back in '57 maybe... I don't know. Really ain't nobody we wanna be jaw flapping at around here no more.

## How long is that gonna take?
He should be back in a couple hours.

## You sure you don't need any help in there?
No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of host would I be if I put my guests to this kind of work.

## Huh?
Grab Mary and come inside.

## Tickets for what?
This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.

## Hey, maybe she knows where this is?
That seems likely.

## Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?

## Yeah?
These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.

## So what?
I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.

## You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
I don't... ...I just thought it was weird.

## When?
When you were outside with Bill.

## What are you laughing at?
I don't know, I think he's funny.

## Hello... ...hey Denise... what, what's wrong, did you break down?
Oh yeah, yeah I've driven by that place before. I seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place.

## Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute. ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
Aw, shit... I gotta pee anyway.

## Yeah, hey how far do you think we are from your Dad's?
It will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate. This trip is fun, but it's starting to get brutal.

## How long has it been?
I don't know... about half an hour.

## What was that?
What? I didn't hear anything.

## Excuse me, may I please use your phone?
Don't be such a fucking smart ass.

## What'd we here, Georgie?
A vehicle registered to a William S. Hudley.

## Recover any bodies?
Not yet.

## You find something, Georgie?
Yep, I found something.

## What'd ya got there?
Keys.

## Huh?
Open up the trunk.

## What do they call you, sweety?
Um, I'm Jerry... that's Bill... Denise and Mary.

## So, what brings you kids way out here, ain't you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks?
Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.

## Didn't ya think, Mary?
I've been meaning to ask you, Mrs... Ummmm.

## Firefly... mmmmm odd name. Mrs. Firefly, do you know anything about the legend of Dr. Satan?
For the show. It's Halloween eve and time for our show.

## Huh?
Just back up.

## I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right?
I'll go. It's my fault.

## Huh?
That stupid hillbilly slut.

## Where is he?
What are you doing? ...no, stop... please, please.

## Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?
My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.

## I appreciate your cooperation. I'm looking for a missing girl... ...this girl here, Denise Willis... have you seen her?
Well, I... mmmmm... no, I ain't seen her, sorry.

## No, I can't say that I ever seen 'em before... ...he looks familiar, is he on TV?
Grampa... watch the language.

## What! God damn, how many?
I don't know. I only saw one.

## What should I do?
Go down stairs and play nice... I'm a gonna go 'round back and handle things like I always fucking do.

## George Willis... ...any leads?
Local girl, Karen Murphy, been missing for a couple months, figured for a runaway.

## Fit the profile?
No, not really. Good kid, never been in any trouble.

## Yeah, I hear it... where's it coming from?
Over here, inside the smokehouse.

## Mr. Willis?
Yes, sir.

## What about the body you found?
Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm, that's a strange one.

## Yeah... ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey senses... like Spider-man... ...you know, like in the comics.

## And?
And think about what you've done.

## It's not so bad. So, it just keeps growing?
Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.

## How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?
Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that I'm interested.

## As much as I loved Nathan, I'm not sorry she killed him, if it means I can have you. Is that a terrible thing to say, my sweet?
Let's go eat, I'm starved.

## French?
Oui.

## Only three shocks. A chimp takes fifteen. This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle?
Oui, doctor, oui.

## Good morning... We need a name for him, don't we?
Oui.

## No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing that. You're a terrific assistant.
Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay?

## Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
Well, I don't know. I'm actually on my way to...

## I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man... but I'm talking too much again, no?
Of course not.

## You're so sweet. Oh, why are there not more men out there like you?
Listen, you're the best assistant I've ever had... Gabrielle.

## I like it when you say my name. Is that stupid?
Oh, Doctor. I did not know. I'm sorry to disturb you. I just came for some papers I left.

## Gabrielle. No, I'm sorry if I startled you. I came to think. God, Did I hang up on you?
Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry.

## Is everything fine?
Oui. Now you've got me talking French.

## Coincidence, yes? And how is our son?
Our...? Oh! He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.

## When you were a little French girl?
Oui.

## Shall we close up, then?
Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.

## It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?
Yes. Happy happy.

## What is wrong, my darling?
Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world.

## I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do?
You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.

## Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?
Hmmmph.

## Gabby, what is it?
Hmmph. Hmmph. Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.

## What is it?
Hi. It's Nathan.

## Call you back. You bastard! What do you want?
I just want to talk.

## Like what?
Well, I think it would be easier if I could talk to you in person.

## What for?
Well, I think...

## Well?
God, you're beautiful.

## Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.
You hurt me, you know, when you made Nathan's Choice. Does that not even matter to you, you pig?

## That's Lila?
A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.

## Where do we look for little lost Puff?
I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape.

## But I like being human now.
That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No?

## You what?
Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a baby's butt.

## You still in the market for a real boy?
Always. Ow.

## I don't get that. Is that sexual?
Shut up and tell me.

## What do you mean?
Somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal- loving psychologist said he would love to meet you.

## Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he?
My brother is discreet.

## Won't he be able to tell?
God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.

## So?
I really like him, Rose. He's so... ...passionate about his work.

## Really?
Yeah. Says he likes you even more than he likes his own mother. And according to my brother Nathan's abormally close with his mother.

## Yeah?
Don't throw that away. I had that once with a guy. But I threw it away for a cheap thrill.

## One night stand?
No. I married a midget.

## Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.

## Oh?
Three foot one.

## No maid service! For God's sake, can't you read the fucking \"do not disturb\" sign on the fucking doorknob?
Lila, it's Rosie.

## How'd you know where I was?
Nathan told my brother.

## Why didn't your brother tell you that Nathan was having an affair?
I don't know, honey. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved.

## Where?
Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have many human characteristics.

## You are a therapist, right?
No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment.

## Paper or cloth?
I hope you don't think me daft. It's important work. It's part of a larger sociological experiment. I'm federally funded.

## What's the larger experiment?
It's my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice, they can be taught to humans.

## Going out on a limb, aren't you, Nathan?
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.

## You do?
Yes, and...

## You really enjoy my company?
Yes. Please don't talk with food in your mouth, Lila. Please. You're so pretty and it only mars your... I'm sorry. I'm being critical.

## You do?
Yeah But I have some peculiarities also.

## I don't care. I don't care! Like what, for example?
I'll be out in a minute.

## Do you?
Of course. I simply love the... naturalness of it all.

## Darling, did you bring the insect repellent lotion?
Yes, darling.

## Oh, and the sun block?
Of course.

## What SPF, sweetie?
Fifteen.

## I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that. Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?
Yes.

## Flares?
Absolutely.

## What?
I don't know. Something.

## A deer?
No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.

## You'll catch cold. It's cold. What do you suppose he is, a survivalist?
I think he's feral.

## Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I'm on to stage five, The human subject.

## What are you doing in there?
Nothing. Be right out.

## Who is it?
Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.

## Who is it?
Absolutely, Gabrielle. Someone from work! Sorry about that, Gabrielle. Uh-huh. Exactly.

## Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle?
It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry.

## Your entire body?
I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...

## Was that okay? I mean, was I able to... satisfy you?
You are an animal.

## So, how's it going today?
Good. Making progress.

## Do you like my new look?
Yeah. It's nice. It's really good.

## Really?
Sure. Of course.

## You remember that from my book? I'm touched! What's wrong?
No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.

## Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?
I guess.

## Really?
Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway.

## How come?
Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...

## I'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up.
Such as what womanly things?

## Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
Ummm. It's good.

## So he's doing okay?
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.

## And what did you do tonight, honey?
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.

## And what did you do tonight, honey?
I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I'm sorry. But that's what the hell I did.

## Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
Yes.

## How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
Lila...

## Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?
Eat shit, thumbtack dick! Thank you, Frank. You're the best.

## Lila?
Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert tonight.

## Extra dessert?
Even better.

## It's wonderful! Do you think I'm ready? Do you really?
I trust that you'll make good, mature decisions. I trust that you'll do the proper thing.

## Now, my diminutive friend, what can I do for you?
Ugnh.

## Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?
Unka unka unka unka unka.

## I have to talk. Is that okay?
No.

## No, why?
Well, it seems that since Lila broached the subject of children, you've been on edge and I know you have an issue with the, uh, body hair.

## Yes?
I saw you on C-Span. I've been looking for you for thirty years. Then there you were, such a beautiful, beautiful grown man.

## Mother?
Yes... Derek.

## Boys just passing through?
Yep.

## Pittsburgh?
Mm hmm.

## Comin' in or goin' out?
Goin' in. We got a sales convention. Gotta be there tomorrow.

## What do you guys sell?
Thanks. Sure is a hot day for driving. Late afternoon is better. You guys have plenty of time. Make Pittsburgh in two, maybe three hours.

## Hey, he's right! Whaddya say, Charlie, huh? Play a little pool? Wait out the heat?
About sixty, seventy bucks.

## You want a chaser?
No.

## You sure you going to be comfortable enough there, Miss... ah... ?
Packard. Sarah Packard.

## It always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. Are you sure you don't want anything?
No, I'm fine.

## You, uh, you ever been to Louisville during Derby week, Miss, ah, Packard?
I've never been to Louisville.

## Oh, I forgot all about it. How's the hands?
It's all right, Eddie. I'm sure Mr. Gordon meant no offense. It was a figure of speech.

## You know what's good for him?
To win.

## For whom and for what?
For what makes the world go round. For money, and for glory.

## You didn't answer my first question. For whom?
All right. Today for me, tomorrow for himself.

## How?
You tell me.

## Are you ready for another?
Thank you.

## In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it?
It's what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give you some money.

## Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?
That's the way it's done.

## You ever played billiards before?
I'm sure Mr. Felson knows what he's doing. Certainly you can afford a hundred dollars to find out.

## How much?
Oh, about five hundred.

## Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. Right, Felson?
I didn't ask him can he beat you. I already know he can beat you. I asked him will he? With Eddie, that's two different things.

## Will you take a check, Bert?
Cash.

## How much do I owe you?
Twelve thousand.

## Okay?
Sit down.

## Yeah? Why?
I lost twenty bucks.

## What is?
Pool.

## You being cute?
I don't think there's a pool player alive shoots better pool than I saw you shoot the other night at Ames. You got talent.

## So I got talent. So what beat me?
Character.

## Okay, okay... What do I do now, lie down on the floor and, uh, bow from the ankles? What do I do, go home?
That's your problem.

## Maybe by that time you'll die of old age. How much do you think you'll, uh, need?
A thousand.

## How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?
In that case, you owe me another drink.

## Whaddya been so far?
Eddie, you're a born loser.

## What's that supposed to mean?
First time in ten years I ever saw Minnesota Fats hooked, really hooked. But you let him off.

## To do what?
Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.

## Why?
Ten reasons. Maybe fifteen. And also there's something in it for me.

## Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?
Seventy-five per cent.

## For who?
For me.

## You think I can lose?
I never saw you do anything else.

## Hey, wait. What are you gonna do about the money?
There are places. I'll scuffle around.

## Now, when did you adopt me?
I don't know when it was.

## Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?
Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.

## What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.

## You know everybody, don't you?
Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.

## Where do I sign?
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.

## What happened to you anyway?
Like I told ya. My thumbs.

## Thinking about what?
Hey, get us a couple of drinks here, will ya? J. T. S. Brown.

## Miss Packard. How do you do?
James Findley is a very rich man. Grandfather left him twenty per cent of a tobacco company.

## How good is he?
I don't know. Never saw him play. They say he's one of the best.

## What's that supposed to mean?
Here, I got it.

## Hey, whaddya say something like that for?
Come on, let's go...

## Where?
Over there by the bar.

## Aren't you gonna go over and talk to him?
Nah. Sit tight. He'll be over here.

## What's the matter? What happened?
It's all right. She had a little too much to drink, that's all. Forget it. Go upstairs and sleep it off.

## How much?
Sure.

## How do we stand?
Bout even.

## When do I raise the bet?
I don't know.

## Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards before?
What's the difference? You got a pool cue, balls on the table. All you gotta do is get the feel of it.

## How're the hands?
They're fine.

## Tell her what?
Half.

## What if I don't pay ya, Bert?
You don't pay me? You gonna get your thumbs broken. And your fingers. And if I want them to, your right arm in three or four places.

## So you figure you're still my manager, huh?
I'm a businessman, kid.

## Well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?
Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.

## Fifty per cent?
No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.

## Boy, we really gave it to her good.
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?

## What's your game? What do you shoot?
You name it, we shoot it.

## What kind of straight pool game you like?
The expensive kind.

## Come up here to play straight pool with Minnesota Fats?
Yeah, that's right.

## Want some free advice?
He's my partner.

## You well-heeled, partner?
You know what I mean. You couldn't make that shot again in a million years.

## Why?
Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before. Bet ya twenty bucks. Make that shot just the way I made it before.

## Whaddya mean?
Let's get back on the road. You gotta be at that convention in the morning.

## Ten grand. I'm gonna win ten grand in one night. ...Well, who's gonna beat me? C'mon, Charlie, who's gonna beat me?
Okay... Okay. Nobody can beat you.

## How do you feel?
Fast and loose, man.

## Hey, how much are we ahead?
Approximately? One thousand bucks.

## How much we got?
Eleven thousand four hundred, cash. Here in my pocket.

## Preacher, go on down and get me some breakfast, will ya? Egg sandwich and a cup of coffee. You want something, Charlie?
Now wait a minute. You're coming with me. You're gonna eat breakfast at the hotel. Pool game is over.

## Get with what?
Twenty-five hours, Eddie. Twenty- five hours you been playin' straight.

## Give me a drink, will ya?
You don't need a drink.

## What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.

## Is this all we got left?
If that's all you got, that's all we got left.

## Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
I asked around.

## Aah! I've got no stomach for that any more. I've had that kind of life.
So am I... Sit down. Would you get us a couple of drinks?

## What kind of life have you got here? Scufflin' around the small rooms, picking up eight, ten bucks a day?
I'll connect. I'll get you your money back.

## Are you figuring on going back to Ames to play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what's on your mind?
Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation.

## This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back. What for? To take another beating?
I told you you'd get your money back.

## With what?
Don't worry about it. I'll raise the money.

## C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money.
Oh yeah? Where?

## What for? To play Fats again?
Yeah, to play Fats again.

## Is that what you think?
Yeah, that's what I think.

## Just like that?
Yeah. Just like that.

## Now and then. Why, do you?
A little, although I'm afraid I generally lose.

## How much?
Bert, I believe Mr. Felson's making a proposition.

## When?
You're very direct, Mr. Felson.

## What time?
I'm having some people over for drinks right after the races. Why don't you all come over? Then about nine, ten o'clock we can play.

## You gentlemen care for a drink?
No, none for me. Come on, let's play.

## Beautiful shot, Felson. Beautiful. You've played billiards before, Mr. Felson. Ah, you gentlemen sure you don't care for a drink?
Oh no, nothing for me.

## Okay?
There it is. I'm broke.

## Who's he?
Now, look, fella, I saw you playing at Ames the other night.

## What's the limit?
Half and a dollar.

## How much you playin' for?
A dollar on the five, two on the nine.

## You quittin' too?
You're a pretty good player.

## How much are you ahead?
Couple of bucks.

## I guess it's just you and me, huh?
Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.

## You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler.

## You sure you don't want to quit, friend?
Let's cut out the small stuff, huh? Hundred dollar freeze-out. Ten games, ten bucks a game, winner take all. And then we'll see who quits.

## You quittin', friend?
Yeah, I'm quittin'.

## Long wait for a bus?
Yes.

## How long have you been waiting?
Since four.

## Just a cup of black coffee, please... Hey, ma'am! Wait a minute! Would you, uh, like another cup?
Fine, thanks.

## What bus?
Yours.

## That wouldn't give us much time, would it?
Well, you're right. I guess it wouldn't.

## Have a nice trip?
Fair.

## Can I sit down?
Why not? We already know each other's secrets.

## Can I buy you another drink?
It's the lights. And the scotch.

## How come you didn't catch your bus?
I wasn't waiting for a bus.

## Same reason you went, at that hour of the morning you haven't much choice. Besides, I only live three blocks from there. Where do you live?
Around.

## Do you always ask so many questions?
No, not always.

## Yeah? What do you do now?
I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college.

## So why go to college?
I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

## What do you do on the other days?
Eddie. The name is Eddie.

## The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.

## I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?
I could always get us a bottle.

## What do you want me to do, just step out in the alley? Is that it?
No. I'll take you home.

## Why did you do that?
I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.

## What time is it?
Eleven o'clock... I'll be back later.

## Why?
Come here.

## How did you know my name was Sarah?
You told me.

## Okay. So what's your name today?
Sarah. Eddie, look. I've got troubles, and I think maybe you've got troubles. Maybe it'd be better if we just leave each other alone.

## Where you been all day?
At school. It's Thursday.

## You were asleep when I left. I didn't want to wake you. Did you go out?
Yeah, I went out for a couple of hours.

## Eddie, where do you go when you go out?
Museums... art galleries... concerts.

## You want to go with me?
Mm hmm.

## You got it all in your head?
When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.

## What did all this stuff cost you?
When you've got money, you'll pay.

## Eggs. How do you like them?
Raw.

## Haven't you opened it?
No, why should I? It's yours.

## You going out?
Yeah. For a little while.

## What are you writing?
Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up.

## What's this supposed to mean?
You'll find yourself another rich old lover.

## Who is it?
Me. It's Eddie.

## What happened?
I got beat up. They... They broke my thumbs.

## A loser?
Yeah. I met this guy -- Gordon, Bert Gordon. He said I was. Born loser.

## Would he know?
He knows. A lot.

## Why did he tell you?
I don't know. I'm not sure. He said there are people who want to lose, who are always looking for an excuse to lose.

## What does he do, this Bert Gordon?
He's a gambler.

## Is he a winner?
Well, he owns things.

## Does it bother you? What he said?
You're not a loser, Eddie. You're a winner. Some men never get to feel that way about anything. I love you, Eddie.

## You need the words?
Yes, I need them very much. And if you ever say them I'll never let you take them back.

## You glad?
Yes, I'm glad.

## Well, what's so funny?
Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.

## What do you want to tell me?
Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.

## For how long?
Oh, I don't know.

## A week? A year?
More like a week. Look, I'll be back.

## Don't you want to know where I'm going?
No. Yes, I want to know what for. But I don't want to ask.

## Why should I?
Now, I never hustled you. Even when I thought I was. You know it.

## Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?
Fifty-seven.

## Where's Bert?
He went off someplace.

## Why?
Just for luck.

## Well, what's the matter?
I'm a little tired.

## Is that a fact?
Yes sir, boy, they, heh, they say that old Fats just shoots the eyes right off them balls.

## Where do you come from?
California. Oakland.

## California? Is your name Felson? Eddie Felson?
That's right.

## Do you like to gamble, Eddie? Gamble money on pool games?
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.

## Hundred dollars?
Well, you shoot big-time pool, Fats. I mean, that's what everybody says, you shoot big-time pool. Let's make it two hundred dollars a game.

## You miss? Well, you don't leave much when you miss, do you, fat man?
That's what the game's all about.

## That's good, Eddie. For how much?
You name it.

## Preacher, gimme my coat, will ya?
Yes.

## How much do you remember?
It comes back. Flashes. My name.

## With them?
Yes.

## When you're here, in the city, where do you live?
Dark and large. With vines -- no, not vines. Not alive.

## Who is this?
My wife.

## Was this -- \"beautiful?\" Before?
Yes.

## What?
Where you lived with them.

## Why don't you start with me?
Mine.

## Have you always had it?
I don't know.

## Have you looked inside?
Yes.

## What's inside?
Humans.

## Who?
I don't know.

## You want me to stay?
Yes.

## Do you still want me to stay?
Yes.

## Good evening. Did you have a pleasant day today?
Busy. I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle. A big vehicle.

## That sounds charming. Did you meet any interesting people today?
Yesterday. They're back. Haven't seen them for a few months. I have to be careful.

## Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
They are... sinister. They want to kill me.

## That sounds charming. What are you planning to do tomorrow?
Stay alive.

## I remember the first time we met. Do you remember that?
Yes.

## Need some gas?
Please.

## I guess you could say that.
So, what do you do?

## Bathroom?
Round back.

## Son ... are you awake?
Yes.

## Do we have to?
I know, son. But you'll like it where we're going. I'm getting a good job. It's a pretty part of the country.

## What's that, Dad?
That's the Air Force Base.

## Is the hill ours too?
If we want it, it is.

## Why, Dad?
Because the sky is so clear out here.

## And that one -- to the right of Rigel?
Which one's that? The dull, red one.

## What did it look like?
It was -- it was -- it changed shape. First it was big and round, then it was flat, then it was long and thin.

## Are you all right, Dad?
Sure ... fine.

## Was there anything over the hill?
I had an awful dream.

## What, Jim, what?
First lemme look at your necks.

## Better now, son?
I'll take you to school.

## What happened to you? Who was that?
That's Ed. Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.

## Where's your car?
I left it at work.

## What's wrong, Ellen?
It's his nightmare. He still hasn't gotten over it ... about the other side of the hill.

## What do you mean -- gone? What the hell kind of a nurse are you, anyway?
I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner. I was out of my office for a minute and when I got back -- he was gone.

## What did he talk to you about?
He was upset with moving, I believe.

## Why, yes. Why?
Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.

## May I ask why?
We were having a little talk.

## About what?
Children often have trouble adjusting to a new school.

## Mr. Gardner, I --
Mr. Gardner, I don't think this is the place to discuss this matter.

## This is a new town for you. Do you like it here?
No.

## Why not? Moving is hard for anybody. Was it hard for you to leave all your friends?
I don't have many friends. Dad's all the time moving.

## That's quite a story. You know that, don't you?
Yes.

## How did it get Mrs. McKeltch?
She said the frog came from around the Copper Ridge. She must've been behind the hill.

## What would you think if somebody told you a story like this?
I'd believe him.

## Why?
Cause he wouldn't lie.

## Do you know how to follow a map?
Yes. I can even read star maps.

## Where, Jimmy?
Behind my house, up on the ridge.

## Does it look to you like anything landed here?
Maybe -- it landed in the bushes.

## Who are you calling?
The State Police.

## Did you call the State Police?
All their lines were busy.

## Let's try.
What is it?

## You're looking for life?
They didn't find any signs of life on the Viking missions.

## What do you think he saw? Could it have been something from the air base?
No, Mom. It wasn't a plane.

## What happened to your other slipper?
Your father asked you a question.

## What?
Don't go over the hill, Mom. Please.

## When?
This afternoon. It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.

## What kind, Mom?
Oh, I can't remember. But people do have bad dreams when their routine is disturbed.

## Gardner? Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here. Why?
His teacher brought him in to see me. Said he'd been acting up in class. Creating a disturbance. I couldn't get a thing out of him.

## What's his family background?
They're from out of state. Father's an engineer at the nuclear power plant. I really don't know much about them.

## Ms. Magnuson, is Jimmy Gardner with you?
Why, yes.

## What do you want?
You have to leave the White House.

## What?
Connie, don't hang up.

## David? How'd you get this number?
Walk to the window. Right in front of you.

## And when is the countdown supposed to expire?
Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.

## What do you want me to do?
I want you to leave with us. Right now.

## You can't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons?
David, don't...

## Thirty seconds? Isn't that cutting it a little too close?
We'll be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off.

## Did it work?
You bet it did.

## Spunky. He told you about that?
All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think.

## Can we expect the same kid of panic here as in Russia?
More than likely.

## What the hell is this?
So sue me.

## Please, would I be this panicked if it was that simple?
Let's retrofit the dish to another satellite.

## What's the bad news?
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.

## That's the good news?
...and we'll be the only guys in town with a clear picture? That's my man.

## Haven't you been watching?
Tell her to get the kids and leave town.

## Okay, why did I just send my family to Atlanta?
Remember I told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction.

## A countdown to what?
Think. It's like in chess. First you strategically position your pieces. Then, when the timing's right. You strike.

## Then what?
Checkmate.

## You have any idea how long it takes for those things to decompose?
You don't move soon. I'll begin to decompose.

## You still got the Olds?
You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.

## Can't this thing go any faster?
You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.

## And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
Dad...

## What the hell is that?
This, pops, is every phone book in America.

## You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
She always keeps her portable phone listed, for emergencies. Sometimes it's just her first initial, sometime her nickname...

## Not listed, huh?
I just haven't found it yet. I tried C. Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook...

## Spunky?
College nickname.

## You try Martin?
She didn't take my name when we were married.

## It's perfect the line is busy?
Yes. I can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the White House.

## Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?
Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.

## You punched the President in the face?
He wasn't the President then.

## It's Air Force One for crying out loud. Still he gets sick?
A cold? Of course.

## What the hell are you doing?
Just getting a feel for her.

## Must be thousands of them. What are they doing?
Looks like they're preparing the invasion.

## What're you doing?
It's not me. They're overriding the system.

## Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
Then God help us.

## Is my wife in the air?
She should be shortly.

## Any news on my wife?
The helicopter never arrived at Nellis and there's been no radio contact.

## Where are they?
ETA with target; four minutes.

## Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia, destroyed?
And there are scattered reports of sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth, And Memphis.

## And our forces?
We're being exterminated.

## How're we doing?
Better than we thought.

## And our troops here?
We've been collecting planes from all over but...

## But what, General?
Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.

## Mr. President, just what do you think you're doing?
I'm a pilot, Will. This is where I belong.

## Grey, you read me?
Roger, Eagle One, our primary target has shifted course.

## Where's it headed?
It had been deemed classified.

## How long would their shields be down?
With their shields down it might be possible.

## A meteor?
No Sir. Definitely not.

## How do you know?
Well, er... it's slowing down.

## It's doing what?
It's... slowing down, Sir.

## They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this?
Wait. I have to tell you something.

## What?
Be careful.

## Really? You don't mind?
Naw. I'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight.

## Sorry for what?
I should have done this a long long time ago.

## Was his father stationed here?
He wasn't his father. I was kinda hoping he'd want the job, though.

## So, what do you do for a living?
I'm a dancer.

## Really? Ballet?
No. Exotic.

## And when the dancing's over? What about your future?
Funny, it used to scare me when I thought about the future. Guess it doesn't really matter anymore.

## I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore.
He's got that SEGA Saturn CD, 64 bit, right?

## Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.

## Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
We're leaving, don't try and stop us.

## For once in your life think about what's best for Troy. Who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up? Who?
I couldn't find anything. Everyone is packing up, they're leaving. Word is a space ship is heading this way.

## Just fell asleep. He's gonna be just fine. Join me in a little celebration?
I'm not leaving.

## What the hell's going on?
We're leaving.

## Above American soil?
If we don't strike soon, there may not be much of an America left to defend.

## Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?
Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability.

## Where do your people come from? Where is your home?
Here... now.

## And before here?
Many worlds...

## Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance? Can there be peace between us?
Peace? No peace.

## What do you want us to do?
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.

## Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
Oh, this map will show you. It was drawn by, uh...

## May we go home now, please?
The dog!? You are named after the dog...

## Dad?
I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.

## Do you believe the Grail actually exists?
The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us.

## Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?
I don't know. Maybe he'll know us.

## Well, now we know the source of the numbers, but we still don't know what they mean.
Where?

## How's the head?
It's better, now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. \"Alexandretta?\" Hmmm...

## What about you?
Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.

## Schneider?
I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.

## Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?
I'd rather spit in your face. But as I haven't got any spit...

## Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.

## You could be more right than you know.
Where did this come from?

## You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?
I usually don't.

## Find something?
Bingo.

## Are you sure?
Pretty sure.

## What's that?
It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet.

## Don't wander off.
Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?

## Mine, too.
What?

## What were they looking for?
This.

## No?
No. You like the way I do things.

## What do you know about this place?
I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.

## What are you going to do?
Don't know. Think of something.

## How do you know?
This book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.

## How did you get here?
Where is it? I want it.

## You came back for the book? Why?
My father didn't want it incinerated.

## Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?
You do.

## I came to get you! What do you think?
Oh, it breaks the heart.

## Through the library?
Right.

## I knew it. And the tomb of Sir Richard?
Found it.

## He was actually there? You saw him?
Well, what was left of him.

## And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
Alexandretta. It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy.

## Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
They want my diary.

## You didn't, did you? You didn't bring it, did you?
I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.

## Don't worry. He won't.
Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to save you, Junior?

## How did you she was a Nazi?
And the chair.

## What final challenge?
Three devices of such lethal cunning.

## Booby traps?
Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.

## But what are they? Can't you remember?
I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.

## Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.

## What about Marcus?
This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.

## What did you get?
I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.

## Hmmm... What did we talk about?
We didn't talk. We never talked.

## And do I detect a rebuke?
Actually, I was a wonderful father.

## When?
Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self-reliance.

## Dad, how can you?
I don't know. We'll find out.

## Now, who are all these people?
Who cares? As long as they're keeping Donovan busy. Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I organize some transportation.

## Elsa never really believed in the Grail. She thought she'd found a prize.
Dad?

## What did you find, Dad?
Me?... Illumination.

## What did you find, Junior?
Junior?! Dad...

## Ready?
Ready.

## Who are you?
The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.

## I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.

## Why are you trying to kill us?
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.

## My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
No.

## My soul is prepared. How's yours?
This is your last chance.

## Who are you?
My name is Kazim.

## Ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ? Is it for His glory, or for yours?
I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.

## Interested in local curios?
No. But I am interested in the occult. And this is a kryta.

## You think so?
Of course. Admittedly, it's taken time. Britain's controlled India for almost two hundred years now.

## I'm sure it's nothing. Just rumors. What was it they claimed was stolen?
Something magical. A sacred rock.

## Rather bizarre menu, wouldn't you say?
Even if they were trying to scare us away, a devout Hindu would never touch meat. Makes you wonder what these people are...

## Miss Scott panicked?
Then she must have run out of the room and you found her.

## Did you discover anything in that tunnel, Dr. Jones?
It's some kind of cult! And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for.

## Hard to believe, isn't it...?
The plane crash and your journey here sound -- most incredible.

## Oh -- good. And maybe the present Maharajah is a little younger? And thinner?
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.

## Dr. Jones? The eminent archaeologist?
We'd appreciate it if the Maharajah would let us stay tonight. We'll be on out way in the morning.

## A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?
I suppose stories of the Thuggees die hard.

## Maybe... but how do you explain The Thuggee shrine I saw right below the palace?
You know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them.

## And didn't the Sultan of Madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?
That was a misunderstanding.

## Lao She.
You understand what he tells us?

## Nee chin lie how ma?
You never told me you spoke my language, Dr. Jones.

## So, it is true, Dr. Jones? You found Nurhachi?
Sure, I found him. Then last night I had a little trouble. Somebody tried to slit my throat.

## What's that?
Okay, Shorty.

## Indy, they make our plane crash? To get you here?
It's just superstition, Shorty. Like a ghost story.

## I ride with you, Indy?
Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty.

## What you look at, Indy?
Just a statue.

## Next time I flatten him! Did you see his eyes?
No.

## The village knew their rock was magic -- but they didn't know it was one of the lost Sankara Stones...
What does it mean, Indy?

## Why they glow like that?
Legend says that when the stones are brought together the diamonds inside of them will glow.

## What?
You were caught trying to steal the Sankara Stones.

## You will go to palace there.
That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?

## Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?
No. Now there is new Maharajah -- and palace is powerful again.

## I don't understand. What's happened here?
The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.

## What evil?
They came from Palace and took sivalinga from out village.

## But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone?
Siam.

## Since I was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a rest? Okay, doll?
I'm freezing. What do you mean, tag along? From the minute you walked into that nightclub, you haven't been able to keep your eyes off me.

## No... I'm not cut out for the kind of life you lead. Oh no... I ripped my dress. Where are we anyway?
He told me they knew I was coming here.

## What do you mean -- how?
The old man saw it in a dream.

## Took what?
It's a sacred stone in a shine that's supposed to protect a village.

## What'd he say now?
It was destined that I came here -- and the future cannot be changed...

## Where'd you find your little bodyguard?
I met Short Round when he tried to pick my pocket.

## What about the future?
Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, incredibly rich prince.

## Oh really?
Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years. Fortune and glory...

## Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?
Maybe...

## What does the writing say?
It's Sanskrit. It tells the story of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he met the Hindu god Shiva.

## That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?
Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.

## You mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village?
I think you should sleep closer. I meant for safety.

## Couldn't keep away, huh?
Just try and control yourself.

## Any more complaints?
Yeah, I wish you'd thought of this sooner...

## Not leftovers?
No -- real food.

## Primitive sexual practices?
You're talking to an authority in that area.

## Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
I think you're too used to getting you own way, Willie...

## Dr. Jones?
I'm going down.

## What?
You've got to go to sleep now.

## Indy? Did you talk to them?
Yes.

## What for?
I'm going to puke in it...

## Who's you?
You're not gonna believe this...

## Who was it?
Me.

## Who?
Al.

## This candid camera?
You're in my head...

## You're in my head? You don't know my name?
I just got here.

## What? You lose your lease on a condo?
Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking to ourselves. People are staring at us.

## Why don't we go home?
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.

## Somebody's been here.
Yeah?

## My place, can't you see?
No.

## Quit screwing around, this is important.
Who are you?

## It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you?
I told you, my name is Al.

## What are you doing in my head, Al?
You've heard of the PEM114...

## Are you threatening me?
I'm trying to get you to listen to reason.

## No.
Me? What'd I do?

## You've heard of U.S.T.?
I just went there for a job.

## Then how'd I get here?
I know...it sounds insane.

## What are you doing?
Loading a gun.

## What for?
Kill myself.

## Are you crazy?
Yep.

## Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
Yeah.

## Why he's argumentative?
Yes...Yes...I'll explain it all. Just put the gun down.

## Why don't you?
No they won't.

## Why not?
I'll talk to them.

## If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
If I'm real, they'll get me out. If I'm not, they'll treat you. Either way you'll be better off than you are now. You'll get a reward.

## Anyone there?
No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up.

## Behind us?
Still clear. Just a motorcycle.

## What's that?
Nothing. Just the cyclist. He's passed us.

## What'd he look like?
He's not the problem. It's the van in the back.

## What do I do?
Whatever you do, just...don't stop.

## Then what are you stopping for?
Get your breathing down. You sound like a cement mixer.

## You have no choice, you're involved. Will you help?
Calm Down! Act rational.

## How do you act when someone trys to kill you?
I don't know...To get Al.

## It can't take that long.
Did you hear that?

## JOE Or what?
I am. You are.

## Find You?
I'm not gonna make it easy.

## Which way do I go?
What does it say.

## Where are we going?
A lab and equipment.

## Who did?
The man.

## Oh my God...What did he look like, the man?
I can't remember..

## What do you mean?
Black suits and helmets.

## Gone where?
Don't know.

## You need ID in there?
You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.

## Just scratched my arm, why?
I'll be out of touch for a while. Just get to the airport.

## Who is it?
Not who. A data bank. Just keep your ear to the phone and don't make a sound.

## What am I supposed to do?
Nothing. You just do nothing.

## What is it?
Composition of the sand, ...trace elements..unique...

## What do we do?
Send a man there. A secret agent.

## What about it?
I don't have any.

## Why not?
It's illegal.

## Who cares?
I'll get in trouble.

## Oh yeah, to what?
You'll be me.

## I don't want to be you. I don't even like you, why would I want to be you?
The beach.

## Eating sushi?
...Just beautiful.

## The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now?
Swim.

## You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it.

## Now what?
The sand.

## Eat it?
Eat it.

## Why not?
A girl.

## She's beautiful...! What do I do?
You're beautiful..

## What's happening?
She doesn't seem to understand.

## Help me out, will you?
What can I do? You're on your own.

## What do I do?
Don't just stand there, say something.

## What?
Anything. Aw hell...Just tell her the truth.

## Where are you staying?
Touch her.

## What?
...Rene...

## Where are you going?
To the hotel. To register.

## But what's it look like?
What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.

## You really like that shirt?
You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.

## Which one is she?
The beautiful one.

## Who, me?
You got a better idea, you tell me. Other than her, there's no one here I know.

## Are you serious?
I feel like an idiot.

## Which one?
The blond...GRUNER. A killer.

## How do you know?
Voice stress analyzer.

## Even Rene?
She's the toughest to read.

## What is it, your charm?
You can't listen. You can't watch either.

## What if she says something important?
I'll be right here. I'll keep it in mind. I'll get a lot more from her without you butting in.

## You got any books in there?
Oh come on.

## What she say. What'd you get out of her?
Ahhh...works...Ryuji... travel...just business...She's.. Fine Arts, University of Tokyo..

## Is that all?
Oh, you were right. They've all been here before... met just last week.

## That's good. It's not better. Where?
Osaka.

## Osaka?
Fountainhead of High-Tech.

## What do I do?
Follow her.

## Just stay here and rest.
On what?

## Where are you going?
Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.

## What do I do?
Relax. Let me do this.

## One of your instincts?
I know she's not with them. I know something else. What's bothering you isn't her.

## What are you doing?
Trying to analyze this stuff. Now...go to the medicine shelf and take ---- and ----.

## What?
He was with Gruner!

## You sure this will work?
Not sure at all.

## What was it? What'd I say?
You said 100,000 yen for the right Sony Walkman.

## haka xuki. What's that mean?
Cash.

## Well...?
It's not the one...Wait... there's a label.

## Where?
It's in the watch. He lead us on that chase while Dieter brought the chip into Hong Kong.

## And Dieter?
He must not know. GRUNER just made the switch back.

## Are you alright?
Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on.

## Aim what?
Holy...

## Pretty advanced, isn't it?
Ought to be, they stole everything and reverse-engineered it. Looks like all they need is the chip.

## What exactly?
I don't know.

## What happened?
Losing power. The laser drained it.

## Where've you been?
Never mind that, where are we now.

## We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?
Gimme a minute.

## About what?
Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.

## Rene?
She works for them.

## They can?
You're a lucky man.

## What are you doing?
Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite.

## JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
It's all we've got.

## JOE What abilities...?
You just got a Mickey.

## What part what?
The best part. She'll love it.

## What is your name?
Don't give her your name.

## Dieter?
I'm against it.

## Can you fly this?
Don't worry.

## Nice?
In my own way...I want you to know that...I love you.

## Then what?
I knew you were trouble.

## What happened?
Joe's escaped. Dieter's in him.

## In him?
It's a long story.

## ya hyutn slulptsa?
They have stolen state property.

## Rene?
She found out what she could ...and delivered him here.

## Who's our little man?
Me.

## You've cut your hair?
I dyed it. We're all getting old.

## How about a deal?
We'll let you go. You leave the pods and the PEM.

## Surveillance Cameras?
They took the tapes.

## We don't even know where to start. What about these people? What do we do with them?
We'll have to let them go.

## He work for us?
Ah...no sir. He was here for a job interview.

## What Job?
Doesn't matter. Then put him away.

## Sir?
Private clinic. Best of care. Total privacy. We'll pay all costs.

## Who is your friend?
We met on the beach.

## What are you doing here, where've you been?
I have a new client.

## That crazy guy?
Yes. Joe.

## Yes?
He's not an ordinary man.

## You remind me of someone. You from the west coast?
...Foreign service.

## What brings you here?
I came for a rest. As, I imagine, you did. To get away with it all.

## And...you know Jan Gruner?
I think I've heard of you.

## What?
Your memory.

## What about it?
It may have been affected.

## What things?
I don't know...the last couple of hours...last few days.

## Do what?
When you remember...

## Right.
Remember what?

## How do I look?
Fine. You look fine.

## Well what?
We're here.

## Here?
Home. Your home. The address on your form.

## Don't you want to get out?
Look, we'll bring your car home. just take it easy until the effects wear off. You need anything, just call this number.

## What?
Take the card.

## Now, Joe, you know it was all a mistake, don't you?
No, it wasn't, It was intentional.

## Why would we want to hurt you?
Not you. Them.

## Who?
I don't know Who.

## Al?
The little man in my... ...head...

## Sue who?
You...him...UST.

## And you, there are many places to get away. Why here?
We have Henekin, Kirin... Very good, sir.

## Sir?
About cholesterol...You know what I know, you'd have the seafood.

## What do you want?
Nothing.

## What did you say?
Nothing.

## Then who did?
You did. JOE No I didn't. You said something first.

## Oh...and who is it!?
I didn't say anything.

## What do you do about what?
...I'm looking for someone.

## Is someone else here?
The poet...something he said...

## Blake said that?
Yeah. One of the corniest lines I ever heard.

## Where?
Dinner...tonight.

## Do what?
Let you leave without it.

## What way?
Like there's someone else here.

## Wait. What's your name?
...Rene.

## And you?
I just work for the travel firm.

## Me still. They left you alone?
I waited for you.

## Why?
...I...don't know.

## Disinterest?
As if your mind's not all there.

## Can I help?
You are.

## Promise you what?
That you're not crazy.

## I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?
You talk to yourself.

## You did.
Why do you do it?

## That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to?
You're talking to me.

## And how'm I doing?
You're doing...Okay.

## ...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
...Naw. Made that up.

## No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
Trans Ocean Travel.

## Is that Ryuji?
No. Ryuji just hires us.

## Hires you for what?
To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.

## How often they come here?
He likes the quiet. They were here last week.

## And you, what do you like?
That depends...

## Why did you leave?
They left. I had to go with them.

## Why did you stay with me?
Wanted to get to know you.

## Why?
You seemed interesting.

## Your friends, did they ask about me?
They kidded me a little.

## What did you tell them?
There's not much to tell.

## Why did they leave?
I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.

## You work for Ryuji?
Sometimes. I told you I did.

## Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
No, he didn't do that.

## Who did?
You did.

## Why?
This business is over.

## Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER?
I'm just on vacation.

## What's he done?
He stole something. From a friend of mine.

## What'd he steal?
A chip. Goes in a computer.

## How do you know you can trust me?
Got to trust someone.

## What is it?
Hiroshima.

## Then why are you smiling like that?
Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.

## What's Gruner like?
They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.

## Who was?
Ryuji and Gruner.

## And you?
It was a good job. Not many ways for a foreigner to make money here. Ryuji hires me to organize business meetings...take care of things.

## Where we going?
Beats me.

## What?
He plays it all the time.

## Now what?
We figure out if it's in here.

## How?
Why don't you get us some food. This may take some time.

## If Gruner led us away, Who'd he lead us away from?
Hong Kong.

## What?
Dieter's gone to shoot a still job. Hong Kong.

## Wait a minute! How'd you know Dieter was coming here?
I asked him.

## What?
I said just relax. I'm in full control.

## That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
Chiang Cho?

## You've been there?
I know the territory.

## You coming along?
So do I.

## This going to work?
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.

## What happened?
I can't fly it.

## Are you alright?
Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.

## Looks like they can. What did they do?
They asked about you.

## What did you tell them?
That I really don't know.

## Now what?
They'll listen to what we say in here.

## Why?
What a mess.

## You can say that again. What do we do?
Nothing we can do.

## What?
They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.

## Can't you do something?
I'm sorry I got you into this.

## Why did you, then?
For you.

## Now what?
I've never met anyone like you.

## Why not, what are you going to do?
Escape.

## Just like that?
I'll come back for you.

## Kiss her you fool.
Aren't you a little optimistic?

## Who are you? Who do you work for?
Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.

## Now what?
We just don't stop.

## Riuji?
I told you, I work for him.

## What is it?
We're not moving fast enough for him.

## What could you find in this place?
...Piece of mind.

## Could have been drunk a little sooner, but excellent...good character...What is it?
I can't. He didn't do anything. Thanks to you.

## Why'd you invite me here?
Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.

## Is there anything else?
A drink...

## Why?
You can't take that.

## Why not?
The experiment. The danger...

## It is?
It will be fine. You have another.

## Tear it apart?
Leaving, now go to sleep. ...all of you.

## This the only spare?
Yes.

## No?
Screw the PEM...What about Al...

## What does he know?
Too much.

## What's new?
Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.

## Yeah? What for?
For reading.

## That's great... Little early for cartoons, isn't it?
Okay.

## Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
I heard them.

## Where?
In the backyard.

## That remote control thing?
Yeah.

## Yes, baby?
There's Dad, on TV.

## VOICE Lowell?
VOICE We'll give you a heads up before we launch.

## How long?
VOICE Three hours.

## Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.

## Sure. Where?
P.J.'s.

## When's your deadline?
Monday.

## And it's bullshit. And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?
I'll take a look at what you got. But I'm not moving any deadlines 'cause you say so.

## Are you all right?
Yeah. Catch you later.

## What I mean is, like, how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement?
Shit...

## Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish?
Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.

## What was that about?
Get me Wigand.

## Okay. Hold on a second... What is it?
Yeah. Yeah, sure. I'll see if I can find him. Hold on... Yeah, Don's looking for you...

## Do you want more rice?
Maybe later.

## What are you cooking?
I'm cooking pasta primavera.

## Since when has the paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on \"60 Minutes\"?
It's an alternate version. So what if we have an alternate version? And I don't think her being cautious is so damned unreasonable.

## Are you suggesting that she and Eric are influenced by money?
Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.

## So, what are you going to do?
Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do that.

## You're taking \"no\" for an answer?
No. I'm not going to take \"no\" for an answer. No.

## Then what are you going to do?
I'm staying right here. Doing my job. Fighting to get my show on the air. You don't like it? Hey, I'll tell you what... fire my ass...

## What the hell are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.

## So, what happened to Ms. Caperelli's checking with outside counsel first, all that crap?
That's happening. And, hopefully we won't have to use the alternate, but we should have it in the can.

## 2 Did you handle the round, Mr. Wigand?
Yes, I'm afraid I did.

## You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...?
2 If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand...

## That computer has everything...
2 That bullet was for a .38 caliber. Do you own a .38?

## 2 You alright, Mr. Wigand?
Debbie...

## What about you, you got a crew already?
I'm gonna do a follow-up.

## How grave?
Well, at the end of the day... because of your segment... the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company... could own CBS.

## Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go to air with this story?
You're getting ahead of yourself. We're all in this together. We're all CBS. We'll find out soon. Thank you, gentlemen.

## How are you, Jim?
Hey, listen, I hear you guys are sitting on something sensational over there.

## How prominent? What kind of placement?
Oh, c'mon, Lowell. This is The New York Times. I don't know...

## VOICE Hello?
Jim, it's Lowell.

## Why?
VOICE Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.

## Did I tell you you were wrong?
I can take her.

## Is there any more rice...?
Yes, it's on the stove...

## I'm sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee mug...?
Try the car.

## What do you need at the store?
Soy sauce...

## Right now?
That's my stuff from the office...

## Why did you take your stuff from the office?
I didn't want to leave it there...

## Why? Who said?
Thomas Sandefur...

## There's a severance agreement... It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage... Sure you don't need anything?
No, thank you.

## What's going on?
I told him that you had an E-mail death threat that said if you didn't shut the \"F\" up, they were going to kill you...

## ...taping? What are you taping?
I'm doing an interview.

## Where should I wash them?
Use the bathroom.

## Can we talk about this when I get back?
Yes... Jeffrey.

## Did you say Berman?
No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with \"60 Minutes\"...

## \"60 Minutes\"?
Yeah.

## \"60 Minutes,\" the television show?
Yes.

## Will independent sources corroborate that?
Hello? Yeah...

## ...it's anonymous. References to \"P.M.\" It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
I have to take a shower.

## What's wrong?
They're killing the Wigand interview...

## What are you and Mike going to do?
Oh, my God.

## Yes, I'm right here. Could you call me back on a hard line?
Alright.

## ...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the State of Mississippi, did you not?
That's right...

## Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him? How do you want to do it?
It would be better if he called us.

## Alright?
Okay. Thank you.

## What chance is there of getting Jeff's interview on the air...?
...I'd be lying to you if I did not tell you how important it was in the court of public opinion...

## You eating with us?
Well, it isn't \"cigarettes are bad for you\"...

## What's this?
Okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way...

## We got a guy... who wants to talk but he's constrained. What if he were \"compelled\"?
Oh, torture? Great ratings.

## How are the rooms? Comfortable?
Thank you for saying that...

## Ordinary people! Under extraordinary pressure, Mike. What the hell do you expect? Grace and consistency?
It went great in Mississippi, Mike.

## After we corroborate it. That's why we've never lost a lawsuit and run a classy show. Anything else?
I discovered this. SEC filing... For the sale of the CBS Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation.

## What?
I'm with Don on this.

## I don't know. How does that get Wigand on the air?
Yeah.

## Alright. What did you think?
I think it was a disgrace.

## Did I get you up?
No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face.

## How many shows have we done? Huh? C'mon, how many?
Oh, lots.

## Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?
Mike... in my...

## That Canada story? Still interest you?
Everything interests me.

## Coffee?
Yeah... Thank you.

## How have you liked your stay?
What I've seen... I've liked.

## Please to explain, why I should agree to interview... with pro-Zionist American media?
Perhaps you prove journalism objectivity and I see the questions first. Then I decide if I grant the interview.

## Who's that?
That's room service. They usually knock first. Come on in... Over here, please.

## How do you like your coffee? Black?
Black, black...

## Like what? Your sign?
I know what I have to know.

## How did a radical journalist from Ramparts Magazine end up at CBS?
...but that's as far as I go...

## Far as you go where?
This issue is a drop in the bucket. I can talk to you about what's in here. But I can't talk to you about anything else.

## Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do... but I don't take that seriously. Where do you work?
Did work.

## How much would I get paid?
That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs. But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand.

## Should I just take the documents now?
Jump in, quick, c'mon...

## I'm Lowell Bergman. We spoke on the phone, remember?
To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.

## They're afraid of you, aren't they?
They should be.

## Seven dwarfs?
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...

## No, you said you were going to call me tomorrow. So, what about?
Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did... I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to hook up and talk to you. About what we were talking about in your car.

## It's okay.
Makes you feel good? Putting what you know to use?

## What did you get us?
Tempura...

## The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus?
Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.

## You charge by the hour?
My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.

## ...to a network, probably, we're all commodities. To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important.
Why?

## You believe that?
No.

## You believe that?
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.

## You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?
Yes.

## Liane, this is a preliminary... You didn't tell her we were taping? What did she think she was coming to New York for?
...to talk about it. To think about it. I had a plan to ease her into it. But, I really -- I didn't know how to do that...

## Did you have a good day?
You attract a crowd.

## You mean... since this morning?
No. I mean since whenever...

## ...I was young. I was young... confused... We didn't handle it the right way...
Oh, you know what we do or do not need to know? Since when have you become a media expert?

## ABC...?
ABC Telemarketing Company.

## What does this have to do with my testimony?
I fought for you... and I still fight for you.

## Where are you, anyway?
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.

## Did he hear you?
MANAGER'S VOICE You're breaking up. I can't hear you.

## Just give me an example...
What about now?

## We have a couple. One's hers, one's mine. Everybody uses a different name. Modern marriage. How's Liane?
She's okay.

## What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
I don't want to be paranoid... I mean, maybe it's a game. Some kind of mind game.

## What are you talking about?
There is -- there is no family.

## What do you mean there is no family?
Liane has filed for divorce...

## Our favorite hotel, honey... I checked into Room 930. Odd choice? Huh?
Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore.

## You heard Mr. Sandefur say before Congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive...?
...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself because I watched those testimonies very carefully.

## And that's what cigarettes are for...?
A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...

## And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
In other words, you were charging Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously...

## And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired. And the reason he gave you?
Poor communication skills.

## And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
Hello.

## Jail?
Possibly, yes. That is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today. That's right...

## Jeff's a premiere golfer... What are you, a two handicap?
Seven...

## You threatening my family, now, too?
Miles, how nice of you to see us -- may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil.

## Yeah. I know. Leather would be more practical, but whatcha gonna do?
Miles, I know you're busy and that you charge by the hour so I'll come to the point. Howard and I are planning to marry.

## Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen and Mandy must be what -- twelve?
Here. Got pictures.

## Oh. Right. Won't you have a seat?
After you, Doll.

## So she's uh, flourishing?
She makes felt wallets. Got one right here.

## Muh -- Well, uh -- Huh?
I... uh guess congratulations are in order.

## What part?
I'd just like to have a word with her.

## Is that... one person?
Here's her picture...

## Is this Mr. Dumbarton?
Uh... poetry recitation.

## Mr. Massey?
Objection, Your Honor. This isn't about Mrs. Rexroth's filial obligations.

## What the hell is Botox?
It's a form of botulism. I just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them...

## No frown lines. New watch?
It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones.

## Got any symptoms?
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.

## What?
The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.

## What?
Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.

## Is she Asian?
Asian? No.

## No. I have the ring. Was I supposed to have a pre-nup?
No. You have the ring. Wrigley has the pre-nup.

## What?
That was Marvin Untermeyer.

## Yes?
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.

## I'm sorry to hear that. But you weren't close, were you?
Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.

## Marylin! What have I done?
I don't know, but don't call me Marylin.

## Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines.

## What is your husband's profession?
He manufactures staples and industrial brad-tacks. He's very successful.

## So who'd you hire?
Ruth Rabino.

## Why do you think she did it?
Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.

## It's about time.
Maybe they put a horse head in her bed?

## You said 'yes' didn't you?
I said yes.

## How nice.
Is Tong older than Ming?

## Positano is beautiful. Remember when we were there, Rex? We stayed in the Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?
These are yours.

## Isn't everything?
Your husband told me you were beautiful, but I was unprepared.

## Did you see the tape?
Not yet.

## What does your lawyer think?
Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down.

## Why would you be here?
I told you. I was hungry.

## Have you ever been married, Miles?
No.

## No. I haven't. Have you?
He wants a reconciliation.

## What is it you're after, Miles?
Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.

## Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
He'll regret this.

## Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth?
Oh, for the love of...

## That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?
That is correct. Not to blow my own horn, but they devote an entire semester to it at Harvard Law.

## -- we are both sure that's what we want?
Absolutely.

## But why him?
We told you. We realized we've always been in love.

## So I hear. Is that all?
No, that's not all.

## Have you tried the duck?
I figure a couple of months. That's how long it should take for the ink on the settlement to dry.

## Yes? Marylin?
You're right about me. I am worthless. I am nothing. I don't deserve to live.

## I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here.

## You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?
Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift.

## No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?
Rex sent me two humidors full of pre- Castro Cubans.

## Is that you?
Me. Yes.

## Oh. And that is -- mom?
Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.

## She held that against you?
Apparently she was very disappointed.

## Friends?
Don't go. Stay with me for a while.

## What is it Miles?
I want... I want to...

## Huh?
No... That wasn't right. I want YOU to be MY wife.

## Did you just propose to me?
Yes.

## Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
Yes, Miles. I accept.

## Do you want me to sleep on it?
No.

## No ma'am. I have been asleep all my life up to this moment. Marylin, will you marry me?
Yes. Again.

## Wasn't she the Judge at my divorce hearing?
Yes. Short notice you know, but I think there's nice closure to it. Hello Judge Muson. A pleasure as always.

## But?
Fabric and fringe.

## You don't like me?
I love you. I want to have your baby.

## What's wrong Miles? Did I spend too much?
Miles. I have a very good relationship with all the salesmen. I can return everything.

## Can you Marylin? Can you return the trust? Can you return the hopes? The dreams? Can you just... SEND IT ALL BACK FOR STORE CREDIT?
I want to nail you ass.

## Salary. Unreported income. By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
You can't prove anything.

## Did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.

## Marylin?
It's a no go, Joe.

## Wait! He works for YOU?
Now. But first, he worked for you.

## You were going to have this thug...?
Wait just a second there. You sent him here. You unearthed this pestilence.

## Rex. Get away from the door.
Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?

## Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
We are. And it's winding down.

## Marylin?
Rex. Go away. I don't want to have to sic the dogs on you.

## Dogs?
Hello, Rex.

## Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?
Sometimes I forget.

## I'm sorry. Where were we?
We were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets.

## Who's that?
Jesus.

## Forgery and Fraud?
You used his credit card.

## Do you think he set me up? Do you think that was his intention?
Now? Well, Marylin, now you cut a deal or find out how Jean Harris made it work for her.

## You want to come out to the beach house tomorrow?
I didn't know Barry had a beach house.

## Do you know him?
By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.

## Who's she?
Now? She's a night manager at McDonalds.

## Well what does he want?
I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised.

## So where are you now?
Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.

## Probably. Every woman in my life was divorced at least twice. What was I supposed to say. Anthropologist?
You're not...

## Is this Ming?
It's not Ming. It's Tong.

## What about rugs? I thought we were stopping at Mansour?
Right.

## What?
He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.

## But you're going through with it?
Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've never been the first wife. Rex was married before me.

## So what?
Miles is different. He's still so idealistic.

## Yes?
You're Miles Massey! You probably don't recognize me. The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair.

## Excuse me?
You ruined my life you sonofabitch. Gimme those.

## Herb wants to see me?
When you have a moment.

## So, Ruth. How's Sam?
Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.

## -- So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth?
My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.

## Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?
Oh brother. Here we go.

## Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe we're being too conservative. Seventy five percent.

## Are you familiar with Kirshner?
Kirshner does not apply. Kirshner was in Kentucky.

## Did Marylin end up with money?
She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup.

## Where does that leave us?
I don't know. I can assume...

## Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
I'm not sure.

## And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
Video.

## Mmm... And to cut to the chase, forensically speaking -- is there a pre-nup?
That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.

## Please -- let me handle this. Okay, Ruth, forget Kirshner -- what's your bottom line?
I think that went as well as could be expected.

## Wait... He wants to give her...?
Nothing.

## And she has...?
Video.

## I am very sorry.
What the fuck...?

## Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
No. You're not.

## What the hell is wrong with you?
I can't help it. Even with the business we're in, I -- it gets me every time. It's so -- optimistic.

## What are they?
Berry spoons.

## Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
She could buy and sell you ten times over.

## What...?
She owes me a meal.

## Wrigley?
Miles.

## Do you have it?
I tried to reach Ruth, but we couldn't get her.

## Extinguish?
Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth.

## Mother?
Hi, Sweetie.

## You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
No. Uh uh. I don't think so. Hmm? No. Well... no.

## Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.

## Three is not Farrow.
I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?

## Who's Rex's guy?
George was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second.

## Well, you can live here as long as you want. Do you have any plans?
We can't do the impossible, Mr. Andrews.

## It's not enough! Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
Whyuhshe's all right, sir.

## Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
Yeah.

## That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted. Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami for the love of it?
Oh, she does, huh? Isn't that sweet of her! You don't , I suppose.

## And this is what you wantthirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
The reward.

## Here you are. Do you mind if I ask you something frankly? Do you love my daughter?
A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.

## I asked you a question. Do you love her?
Yes! But don't hold that against me. I'm a little screwy myself.

## What's this about not eating?
I don't want to eat! And there's one more thing I don't want! Definitely! That's to see you.

## Why don't you put me in chains?
I might.

## Not so far as I'm concerned, you're not. Yes?
Smart, aren't you! So subtle.

## Where are you taking me?
Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.

## That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup?
You talk as if he were a gigoloor something.

## Stunt?
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.

## What's the matter, Ellie? What's wrong?
Nothing.

## I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby. This must be serious. Where'd you meet him?
On the road.

## Who is he?
I don't know.

## Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off?
No, I'll go through with it.

## Is that his name?
Oh, nono.

## You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad?
Why, no ... Don't be silly.

## Are you going to see him?
If you really mean it, I will.

## On a hunger strike, huh? When'd she eat last?
She hasn't had a thing yesterdayor today.

## Been sending her meals in regularly?
Yessir. She refuses them all.

## What a hell cat. No controlling these modern girls. They're terrible!
Why didn't you jam it down her throat?

## What about that diamond wrist watch she had onshe can raise some money on that?
Why; naturally, I

## Try. Do me a favor. Try. It's your only chance. And hers, too. Do that for meand maybe we'll be friends Maybe. Do we understand each other?
Yes, sir.

## Yes, of course.
You thought that up all by yourself, huh?

## What happened?
I haven't the slightest idea.

## What do they say?
They're practically all the same, sir.

## Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody?
I was gonna do it, but Ma wouldn't let me. She was ashamed, I guess.

## Hey, hey, aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?
Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil? \"My tonsils won't burn As life's corners I ...

## Hey, whadda you tryin' to dokid me?
What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.

## Oh, yeah?
Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.

## These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
Maybe they doand maybe they don't.

## Are you talking to me?
Yes. Tell that man to drive slowly.

## Don't tell me your ticket was in it?
No, I've got that, all right. But my money. All I have here is four dollars. I've got to get to New York with it.

## Oh, thank you. We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
Yes.

## I hated to wake you up. How about some breakfast?
No, thank you. Thank you so much.

## Seems to me I've already thanked you for that. What time is the next bus to New York?
What are you excited about? You missed the bus, too.

## My ticket?
I found it on the seat.

## What are you talking about?
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.

## What for?
That's none of your business.

## Oh, you did? What am I expected to doleap for joy?
I kind of half expected you to thank me.

## Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How's your's?
Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but you've been very kind.

## You're not really serious about this, are you?
Not at all.

## Who are you?
Who, me? Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.

## You've got a name, haven't you?
Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.

## Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed?
Listen, BratI'm going to count to ten. If you're not out of bed by then I'm going to yank you out myself.

## Like what?
Like this. I have no robe.

## Where is the shower?
Your hair's cute like that. You should never comb it.

## Very outspoken, too. Said I looked funny. Wasn't that cute?
Hurry up and get dressed.

## Why, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends?
If you didn't waste so much time on that wise-cracking drummerwe'd have been through with breakfast by this time.

## Egg. One eggdoughnutsblack coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
Nope. No complaints.

## What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
Must be the Spring.

## Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.

## Santa Claus?
KingKing Westley was in it.

## Oh. Is that how you met him?
Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged.

## Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
Don't look at me. I didn't marry King Westley.

## What are you talking about?
Don't get excited, Peter. They just asked a civil question.

## Peter Warne, you've gone far enough. I won't stand being insulted like this another minute.
There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument?

## Say, you were pretty good. Jumping in like that. Got a brain, haven't you?
You weren't so bad yourself.

## How about Cinderellaor a real hot love story?
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.

## I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
I don't trust that chatterbox.

## What do you meanstarvation?
It takes money to buy food.

## Why, haven't you?
Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.

## I didn't give him anything . You were the big-hearted gal. How about wiring your father now?
Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.

## To New York?
Yeah.

## Aren't you afraid of me?
No.

## We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
If you're scared it scares the hunger out of you.

## What's got into you?
Oh, Peter! I was so scared.

## What?
Nothing. Nothing you'd give two cents for.

## What are you thinking about?
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.

## Really?
Yeah. I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy.

## What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
No. But I've got a penknife.

## Needn't rub it in. What're you eating?
Carrots.

## Uh-huh. Want one?
No!! It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat.

## What if nobody stops for us?
Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.

## Well, it is simple. It's all in the thumb, see? A lot of people do it
Amazing.

## Yes. But look at all the fun you had. Mind if I try?
You! Don't make me laugh.

## What're you going to do?
Mind your own business.

## What for?
I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.

## Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right?
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.

## What about money?
Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.

## Yes. You'll have a great story, won't you?
Yeah, swell.

## Thank you. Am I going to see you in New York?
Nope.

## Me?
Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.

## I'll bet you're in an awful hurry to get back to New York, aren't you?
Goodnight, Mr. Warne.

## Whome? Want to see me?
No, it isn't. I'm hungry andand scared.

## Do you know?
You sound like a hobo.

## Is that the Walls of Jericho going up?
Yep! The Walls of Jericho.

## How are you, Ellie? Are you happy?
You bet we did.

## Where's the bus to New York?
Left twenty minutes ago.

## When does the bus leave?
Yesif he is your husband.

## Isn't he here?
No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.

## What's that?
I've been thinking about you.

## Yes?
Eight o'clock.

## What's up?
Bridge washed outaround Dawson.

## Up yonder. See the lights?
Yes.

## You mean about the Andrews' kid?
That's it. I got it all written up. Ready to go. All I want is a thousand dollars.

## What's the thousand bucks for?
To tear down the Walls of Jericho.

## Huh?
That she's going to marry somebody else.

## Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
If it's on the level.

## Who's she gonna marry?
It's all right here. Give me the thousand and it's yours.

## Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.

## Wouldn't have made a bad story, would it?
Great! But that's the way things go. You think you got a swell yarnthen something comes alongmesses up the finishand there you are.

## Yeah, where am I?
When you sober upcome in and see me.

## What?
I ain't got a hat.

## Funny couple, ain't they?
Yeah.

## What do you reckon that's for?
Blamed if I know. I just brung 'em a trumpet.

## A trumpet?
Yeah. You know, one of those toy things. They sent me to the store to get it.

## But what in the world do they want a trumpet for?
I dunno.

## You send telegrams here?
Go on. Go on send the telegram.

## Collect?
There's a seat over there for you.

## What's the idea?
I'd like to sit with myuhwifeif you don't mind.

## Oh, excuse me. I was just tryin'you knowto make things pleasant.
Wife?

## What's up?
Looks like we're going to be stuck for a long time.

## What?
I'd go fifty-fifty with you .

## Why?
Cause I'm a guy that don't believe in hoggin' it, see? A bird that figures that way winds up behind the eight ball, is what I always say.

## What's on your mind?
Five G'sor I crab the works.

## Yeahthe \"big boy\"the Boss of the outfit.
Huh?

## You're not kidnapping her, are you?
Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, seeand

## Where do you live?
Orange, New Jersey.

## Got a couple of kids, huh?
Yeah. Just babies.

## SuresureI'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister.
You love them, don't you?

## If you don'tEver hear of Bugs Dooley?
No.

## I don't care if he was doing it with giraffes in the zoo, Numa, it's none of our business. Let's keep this side of it quiet, shall we?
When you're in a war, boss, you use every weapon you got.

## When did you first do business with this Bertrand?
Oh, I first heard these street cats jiving about him back in '56, '57 when I lived down in the Quarter.

## What was his voice like?
You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know. He had command of the king's English.

## Did he pay?
Always - like tits on a pig. I wish I had a million of those bimbettes.

## And Oswald?
Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...

## So you saw Oswald how many times?
Three, four. He came in with a few Cubano swishes one time I remember...

## Recall any names?
Mario, Jose - they wear names like you and I wear clothes. Today the name is Candy, tomorrow it's Butsie. I wish I could help you, Jim.

## Then how the hell did you get in the Warren Commission, Dean? Except through the phone records in the Dallas jail?
There were no phone records.

## Well, the kid musta gone nuts, right? I said Oswald must've flipped. Just did this crazy thing before anyone could stop him, right?
I think I'll cut out here, chief. I gotta get home.

## Who the hell opened my files! You've been looking through my private files, haven't you, you weasel?
You may not like this, chief, but you're beginning to act paranoid. I mean, you really are.

## I always lock my files. And you were the only one here today... What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
You know what I mean. I saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer. And a lotta strange people.

## Who?
Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...

## Or a cover up! Jesus, Bill, don't you have enough proof of the FBI's complicity now?
Bill.

## Correct me if I'm wrong. I thought we were on the same side. What the hell business is it of theirs to say that?
Pretty fast, wasn't it. The way they let him go.

## What do you think, Lou?
I'm just an investigator, Bill. I leave the theories to you lawyers.

## You know you keep saying that.
You, Numa?

## Keep saying what?
You're not digging.

## What's the other name?
Shaw. Clay Shaw.

## Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw? The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.

## Clay Bertrand, Willie?
Yeah. Clay. I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.

## Did he pay you for this?
Twenty dollars each time. Hell, it's no secret. That's what I'm here for.

## And that's where you met Oswald for the first time?
Yeah, strange guy. Dave introduced him as...

## Hold your horses. What kinda source?
The anonymous kind, Chief.

## Morning, boys. Ready for a walking tour?
At 7:30 Sunday morning? It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.

## What the hell's a Communist like Lee Oswald doing working out of Banister's?
Lord, wake me, please. I must be dreaming.

## I'm lost, boss. What are we saying here?
He had his palm print on the weapon.

## But why?
To frame him, obviously. You got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think, Bill! They're not ordinary crooks.

## Can you get some sworn statements?
That's gonna be tough. Nobody's talking.

## All right, all right. Break it up.
Oh Jesus, Stoner!... Why doesn't he call me?

## Where you going, boss?
I don't know, Bill, I just don't know.

## With a full-blown conspiracy to cover it up? Y'ever read your Shakespeare, Bill?
Yeah.

## What's it look like, Nick?
I don't see any violence, Jim. Heart attack, maybe an aneurysm. Looks like natural causes.

## Nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?
He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.

## Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?
If it's a suicide, I seen weirder, Jim.

## Why?
Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.

## I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
Well, you see, I've been subject to hypnosis and psychological warfare ever since 1948, when I was in Korea...

## ...Oswald?
No, I did not.

## ...ever called Dean Andrews?
No, I did not.

## ...and have you ever met David Ferrie?
No, I would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures I've been shown.

## ...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?
No, I did not.

## Calm down, Dave, what?
I'm a dead man! From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.

## You still questioning any Cubans?
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.

## ...give me protection?
Yeah! He'd kill for you Dave. He likes you. Your mind.

## Did we involve you, Dave, or did Clay Shaw?
That cocksuckin' faggot! He's got me by the balls.

## Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?
That's not true. I never met anybody named Oswald. Anybody who told you that has to be crazy.

## I'm sure you've seen this. Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
No, I never saw him before in my life.

## What was so appealing about Houston?
I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.

## I see. And where did you drive?
We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.

## Why Galveston?
No particular reason. Just to go somewhere.

## And then Sunday?
In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.

## Did you bag any geese on this trip?
I believe the boys got a couple.

## Why? What's wrong?
Dave, I find your story simply not believable.

## Same one. I didn't know no impersonator.
Let me get this straight, now. Clay Shaw is blackmailing you?

## And Shaw?
Shaw's an \"untouchable\", man - highest clearance. Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans - all Agency.

## Then who killed the President?
Dave, it's going to be okay. Just talk to us on the record and we'll protect you. I guarantee it.

## Colonel Finck, are you saying someone told you not to dissect the neck?
I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.

## As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?
I had the cause of death.

## But you were a qualified pathologist. Was this Army general a qualified pathologist?
No.

## What?
I call'em as I see'em, Jim. I'm ruling it inadmissible.

## Daddy! Where have you been?
Hi, Freckle Face.

## Are we going away, Daddy?
Well, it looks like it, Jasper.

## Because of Kennedy? Are the same people gonna kill us, Daddy?
No, Jasper, nobody's gonna kill us.

## Look, do you want the truth, or just what you want me to say?
I want the truth.

## How many shots you say you heard?
Four to six.

## Don't get sidetracked! How does he get back to the States? That's the point. Does he have any problems?
This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific! He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!

## But who meets him when he gets off the boat in New York in June '62?
Spas T. Raikin, a leading member of an anti-Communist group.

## And Marina? Does she have a problem getting out?
Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.

## No, I don't think I am, Susie. Anyone else?
I'm sorry.

## We recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you. Are you acquainted with a David Logan?
No. Never heard of him.

## A Perry Russo?
No.

## A Willie O'Keefe?
No, I don't believe I know anyone by that name.

## Who?
David Ferrie.

## No, it was not. Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?
One meets so many attorneys in my business. No, I don't believe I know Dean Andrews.

## Mr. Shaw, did you ever meet Lee Harvey Oswald?
You really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters, don't you, Mr. Garrison.

## And if I was, Mr. Garrison... do you think I would be here today... talking to somebody like you?
No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops.

## Jim, dinner's just about ready... I've got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim? Jim, dinner.
You mean you identified him on Saturday, the day before Ruby shot Oswald?

## Come on now, we'll talk about it at the table, dinner's getting cold. What are you doing in here?
I can't believe a man as intelligent as Earl Warren ever read what's in those volumes.

## These books are getting to your mind, Mr. Garrison. I wish you'd stop readin' them.
Honey, you all right?

## Because when I scheduled it I didn't realize it was a holiday. You were there, why didn't you say something?
Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake. You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.

## Did they live?
It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.

## I'm leaving. I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving! I won't stand it anymore.
Did you enter Virginia into a beauty contest?

## You and your government! What's the matter with you? Don't you have any feelings? Your daughter! What kind of man are you?
I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.

## I never doubted for a second that I was. Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?
I don't think so, Jim...

## Huh?
He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy. They shot him down.

## For sexual purposes?
Well... yeah.

## Willie, are you willing to repeat your statements under sodium pentothal? Under the supervision of a doctor?
Fuck, yeah! I told you so. And you can tell'em all I told you so.

## What's wrong, Lou?
Boss, the President's been shot. In Dallas. Five minutes ago.

## Oh no!... How bad?
No word yet. But they think it's in the head.

## Lou, you were in the Marines. Who would be running that training?
The Office of Naval Intelligence.

## What are you driving at, boss?
They took 'em to the Sheriff's office, not the police station, and they let 'em go. No record of them ever being questioned.

## ...take a good look, chief, do any of 'em look like the hoboes you remember?
Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.

## Can we find her?
I'd say the opposite - hypertension.

## Time?
Between six and seven seconds.

## Didn't Hoover say something about that? The leaves had fallen off in November?
The Zapruder film is the proof they didn't count on, Lou. We gotta get our hands on it.

## Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up Houston? There's plenty of time - he's out in the open - a frontal shot?
When Kennedy gets to the kill zone, it's a turkey shoot.

## You know who the mayor was?
No.

## The Warren Commission call him?
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.

## Allen Dulles?
They're gonna love you, chief.

## Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?
Well, if that's what you want to call it. I didn't ever think it would come to this. I guess I am, boss.

## I thought the FBI test-fired the rifle to make sure it could be done?
You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it.

## You think there were other men involved, Russell?
I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry. Call me whatever you like.

## Are they? Why would they?
Yes.

## I don't... I can't believe it. They killed him because he wanted to change things. In our time - in our country?
Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me. Don't trust me. Do your own work, your own thinking.

## The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?
I haven't yet. I don't have much of a case.

## His name?
...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.

## Here's my problem, Jack. You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?
More than ten years.

## And he never hit you before?
Never touched me.

## How much more?
I don't know if I should talk about this.

## Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
If you buy what you read in the paper.

## You have other information?
I didn't say that. All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.

## Where is Banister in all this?
Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse.

## And Oswald?
Anything more specific, Jack? It's important.

## Anyone else involved at Banister's level?
Clay something, that was his name - Clay.

## Bertrand. Clay Bertrand?
Yeah! That's it. I don't know. Maybe it wasn't. I gotta go.

## Clay Bertrand. He's in the Warren Report. He tried to get Oswald a lawyer. Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?
Sure. 'Course they hated the sonofabitch, but...

## The assassination, Jack?
Never. Not with me sir, never... Listen, I think I'd better go. I said enough. I said all I'm going to say.

## Hold on, Jack. What's the problem?
What's the problem? What's the problem? Do I need to spell it out for you, Mr. Garrison? I better go.

## Even my own wife, chief, Who's wondering where I am?
Hate mail here. Fan mail here. The bad news is the IRS has just requested an audit on your income from this office.

## Welcome, Mr. Miller. Jim Garrison. Would you care for some coffee?
Yes, thank you, Mr. Garrison. Your coffee's almost Turkish down here but I could get used to it.

## Where were you? Europe, Pacific?
Germany.

## I know about that shot. A terrible tragedy. How much do you have for carrying on your investigation?
If you must know, virtually nothing.

## How many men are working with you on this?
Less than you would guess. Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.

## That's all you've had all this time?
That's it.

## Virginia or Elizabeth?
Virginia.

## Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest. Would you like to be in a beauty contest?
That sounds fun.

## I need some information from you then. How old are you?
Six.

## And you get of from school at 3 every day?
Yes.

## Do you walk home?
Uh huh.

## When are you going back to Washington, sir?
I am going back very shortly after we finish this hearing - I am going to have some lunch.

## Can I help you?
Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye on.

## I think I'm gonna just get this for today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would you mind ringing this up while I change out of it?
Not a problem.

## So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow?
I'll call her.

## Won't forget?
I won't forget.

## Who was there for your ass?
You were there for me.

## Who?
You.

## How old is that machine gun shit?
That's not what they're tellin' me.

## That's why they call it \"fuckin' with ya.\" Now you wanna hear how we retaliate?
Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just -- you know -- smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV.

## What?
I need a favor.

## That requires me goin' out tonight?
A bit.

## Well, it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got?
Go ahead.

## Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk no minutes. Why don't I just ride with you?
You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it.

## Answer the question, nigga. Do you think I wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass? Yes or no?
Course you didn't.

## Does he have the marked bills on him?
In his inside coat pocket.

## Why were you with him?
I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.

## How'd you know where he was?
I found out.

## And you didn't tell the Police?
I told Jackie, and Jackie said you wanted him.

## I'd say there's about, oh, fifty thousand dollars here. What would you say Ray?
That looks like fifty thousand dollars from here.

## Ever heard of a fella named Beaumont Livingston?
Great, you're here.

## What's going on?
She wants to make a deal.

## She sound scared?
She almost sounds scared.

## What's she want?
She wants to go back to work.

## What's she willing to give us?
She hasn't one into specifics yet, she's been waiting for you.

## She knows it's my case?
She ain't said it, but she's not stupid, she knows it's you who wants her.

## Can I have a word with you?
Sure.

## Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus. L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in that bag?
The usual things. I'm a flight attendant with Cabo Air.

## If I were to tell you \"no it isn't...\"
I'm not saying another word.

## While you're at it, let me see what else is in there. You mind?
My pocketbook.

## What's in it?
Beauty products.

## What's this?
That's my diet shit.

## Let me have a word outside with Agent Nicolet for a moment?
Take your time.

## Help us do what?
Help you get Ordell Robbie.

## How was your flight?
Fine.

## He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
She leaves, somebody'll be on her.

## I can give you a lift home if you'd like?
Okay.

## Who do you think I am?
I gave you my card there.

## Who put up my bond? Ordell?
In cash.

## Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
I don't think so.

## I thought you might want a drink?
I'd love one, but not there.

## That doesn't sound dark.
Is it dark?

## Why does it need to be dark?
Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that's why. You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by me.

## You gain weight?
Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.

## Was she helpful?
She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender. I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.

## You're not tired of it?
I am, as a matter of fact.

## So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.

## You know who put the dope in your bag?
They wanted you to tell them what you know.

## What did they want to know?
That would be Beaumont Livingston.

## That's him. How do you know 'em?
I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.

## Ordell pick up his bond?
Same as you. Ten thousand.

## No, you didn't. What branch?
Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.

## How many trips did you make?
With ten thousand? Nine.

## If you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law, why not pack a hundred grand?
Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.

## What'dya think?
I think maybe I have more options than I thought.

## You get a chance to use it?
I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.

## What, I couldn't hear you?
You went out this morning and bought a gun.

## Somebody loan it to you?
Yeah.

## Want to hear some music?
Sure.

## You never got into the whole CD revolution?
I got a few. But I can't afford to start all over again. I got too much time and money invested in my records.

## Who is this?
The Delfonics.

## 76?
74, I think.

## Are you?
I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.

## How'd you find that out?
He told me last night.

## He called you?
He came by.

## What?... What'd you do?
We talked.

## He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out.

## How do you get it out?
Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work.

## You're gonna offer to set him up?
If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.

## How do you feel about getting old?
You're not old. You look great.

## I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
It's not really something I think about.

## Really?
Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it.

## How'd you feel about it?
I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me.

## Bigger?
Yeah.

## I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you wrote?
Fifteen thousand.

## I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?
Catching a movie.

## How was it?
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.

## Oh, are you? Does she know that?
No... ...I don't believe she's ever heard of me. But that doesn't mean we're not going steady.

## And Annette's it for you?
For now. These relationships never last too long.

## Sandra Bullock. You know her?
Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in \"Speed.\" She's cute.

## Why?
I'm old enough to be her father.

## How old's Annette?
I don't care.

## What're you, a bag lady?
I go back to work tomorrow.

## You talk them into it?
They seem to like the idea.

## Bring the money in and they follow it?
Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.

## You don't actually do it that way?
Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.

## Will Ordell go for that?
I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him.

## He was here?
Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.

## You think he's got a thing for you?
Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.

## I don't follow your logic. What does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting Ordell's money?
He's setting me up to make a proposition.

## Has he hinted around?
You know some interesting people.

## Has Nicolet told you any colorful stories like that?
He tries to act cool.

## What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.

## If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.

## Why?
A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.

## When did you decide?
It's been a long time coming. I finally made up my mind -- I guess it was Thursday.

## The day you got me out of jail?
Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.

## Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?
Uh-huh.

## What do you do when he comes home?
Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.

## You do that?
That's my job.

## And is that it?
More or less.

## If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it?
I believe I said I'd be tempted.

## What if I've figured a way?
The feds. It's evidence.

## Do you think they bought it?
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.

## Where's the rest of it?
In the bag underneath.

## What if he checks it?
He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.

## How'd you find out?
All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.

## How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
He's liable to shoot you.

## So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
Get Ordell to come to your office.

## Tell him you want to see him?
Tell him I want to give him his money.

## Why?
I've chickened out. I'm afraid of him. He'll like that.

## What do you tell Nicolet?
Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.

## We get Ordell to come to my office. Nicolet -- is he already there, or does he come busting in while we're chatting?
He's already there.

## Well, we don't let that happen, now do we?
I got your package. It was fun getting a half-a-million dollars in the mail.

## Did you tell him you were leaving?
I told him I might.

## Do you blame yourself for helping me?
I'd feel a whole lot better if you took some more money.

## Where're you going?
Spain.

## Wanna go?
Thanks, but you have a good time.

## Sure I can't twist your arm?
Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.

## I thought you were tired of your business?
I'm just tired in general.

## Are you scared of me?
You tell those guys they'll have to do one helluva lot better than that before I'll even say 'hi' to them.

## What if I plead guilty?
And cooperate? You might get probation.

## If I don't cooperate?
He say we like the same thing as married.

## Do you live together?
Most of the times.

## Not every day?
Sometimes every day, for a while.

## Then you don't see him for a few days?
Yes'm.

## You know what's in the bag you're taking?
He say is a surprise.

## What the fuck is that shit?
I know what it looks like.

## It isn't enough for Trafficking, but how 'bout Posession with the Intent to Distribute?
We'll just be a minute.

## Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell me, what can we do for you?
I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.

## Oh, so now you know him?
You never asked me if I did or not.

## No shit. You know how he makes his money?
He sells guns.

## You ever see him sell guns?
No.

## What are you doing?
I'm recording this.

## You two meet?
This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.

## You talk to him?
Not really.

## Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?
I imagine shit needs to be done.

## Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
Not yet.

## Who's the other one?
White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.

## And splittin' with her?
I'm sure that was the idea.

## What did you say?
I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.

## She told you that?
Uh-huh.

## Was she there?
She didn't say.

## But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
Uh-huh.

## Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?
Right. Everything's the same, except one change...

## Well, it's true, isn't it? After this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else. What do you think?
We could, if I'm not in jail.

## You didn't count it?
I never have. It's not my money.

## What? To put one of these in my pocket?
Uh-huh.

## If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?
Yes. All those things are true.

## After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
That would be one point of view.

## How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
Si.

## Where's the bag she gave you?
You took the time to pay the saleswoman.

## There was a guy with Melanie?
Not in the fitting room.

## It's possible. You're saying you don't have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand?
I have no idea.

## You'd take a polygraph on it?
If it'll make you happy.

## Do you think I took some of that money?
Oh, hi.

## Buy ya a beer?
I'm waiting for the phone.

## Better get me another Sam's. Join me in a Jaeger shot?
Uh-uh.

## How long you been with Ordell?
This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.

## He told me to go outside. \"You may leave us now.\" It's all part of his pathetic attempt to be \"the man.\" You know Mr. Walker don't you?
Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about Ordell.

## That coke was yours, wasn't it?
He said he didn't know about it.

## You already knew that?
Kinda.

## You think I'm kidding?
Dreaming.

## What's that fucker ever done for us?
I don't think so, but thanks for the beer.

## Jackie?
Hi, Melanie.

## Yeah, do you like it?
It looks good on you.

## Do you got something for me?
You betcha.

## I put a little cherry on top. You're right. What the hell he ever do for us?
Thanks.

## How you doing, Ms. Jackie?
I was expecting you. Come in.

## Got some o.j.?
Yeah.

## Well, then, why don't you be a good hostess and make me a screwdriver?
Sure.

## Who you think got your ass outta jail?
The same guy who put me in, thanks a lot.

## And what was your answer?
I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.

## Yeah?
I didn't tell 'em anything.

## This fella Beaumont, they say what happened to him?
They told me.

## What do you think it is?
I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.

## Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.
What the hell you doin'?

## Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying?
Baby, I ain't come here -- She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.

## Way I see it, me and you only got one thing to talk about. What you willing to do for me?
Baby, I didn't --

## Yeah?
I got a problem...

## The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...

## Oh, wait, you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it?
It's a cockatoo.

## You a fine lookin' woman, Jackie. I bet you do a damn sight better than okay. You think anybody followed you?
I don't think so, but it don't really matter. They know I'm meeting you.

## How the fuck they know that?
I told them.

## You told em? You told em it's me?
They already know it's you.

## Didja tell 'em anything else?
I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico, and you want me to bring it here.

## What did they say?
Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I ain't goin anywhere near that money.

## Who?
I don't know. One of your friends.

## But you don't?
No, I give it to someone else first.

## I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.

## I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
Well, it's my plan. We're in this together.

## The money's in a Broadway shopping bag. I get some food, and sit down here in the food court. Then your girl comes -- you got somebody yet?
Uh-huh.

## What'd you care?
Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.

## Drink?
I need to talk to you alone.

## What the hell you talkin' bout?
Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout.

## How do you know she did that?
I was there, I saw her do it.

## Are you sure she don't know about the money?
She don't know shit about the money.

## Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like?
She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.

## Where you gonna be during all this?
I'm gonna be sittin' at the titty bar In downtown L.A. till my man over here calls me and gives me the O.K. sign.

## Who's paging you?
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.

## Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
He won't know where the money came from. Only that it's money.

## It's boring, isn't it?
I can sit through it once.

## Want a hit?
Sure.

## When did you get out of jail?
Four days ago.

## Where at?
Susanville.

## How long?
Two months shy of four years.

## Four years?
Uh-huh.

## What for?
Bank robbery.

## Is it ready to go?
Yeah, there's another hit left.

## You okay?
Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing.

## What's a Metrix?
It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.

## It's a diet thing?
No, it's what body builders drink to beef up.

## Which one?
The roller disco one.

## You're fourteen years old here?
Yeah.

## Were you a disco girl?
Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.

## So where did you go?
The beach. Or get high, drop acid at a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S. girl. I hated disco.

## That was taken at a place called \"Flippers.\" It was in Hollywood. Were you in L.A. back then?
No.

## Where were you?
Detroit.

## With Ordell?
We had done time together already.

## Were you a disco guy?
No.

## Did you ever go I one?
That's a picture of me in Japan.

## You been to Japan?
I lived there for about nine months.

## You lived in Japan, when?
About five years ago.

## Who's arm is that?
That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.

## Wanna fuck?
Sure.

## Is it dead?
Yeah.

## That's not what I'm saying at all. You know where he went?
No.

## Does that bother you?
Please.

## Uh-huh?
Course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. That's what he's doin' with this stewardess. He's scheming how he can get it over here.

## And your point is?
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...

## Uh-huh?
...and just take it from him.

## I'm getting out of here. What do you think?
Gimme that bag before I knock you out and take it.

## Is it this aisle, Lou-is?
Yeah, down the end.

## Is it this aisle or the next one over?
This one.

## You sure?
I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word.

## What's your cost?
As low as two.

## Are you serious?
That's what I been tellin' you. Start adding these motherfuckin' figures up, and you tell me this ain't a business to be in.

## Then what?
I get out. Spend the rest of my life spending.

## Sure. We almost done, ain't we?
Take the keys, man. Listen to music.

## Which one is for the car?
This one's for the ignition... ...but you gotta hit this thing to shut the alarm off and unlock the door.

## What do I do?
Okay.

## Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?
Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.

## Guess where I am?
I dunno.

## You're outside?
Uh-huh.

## Who was that?
That was Beaumont.

## Who was Beaumont?
An employee I had to let go.

## What did he do?
Yeah.

## So we on the same page then?
I follow.

## How much is there?
Over half-million dollars worth of merchandise.

## Can I ask you about Melanie?
Sure.

## She believed you?
Hell, yeah. To her dumb country ass, Compton is Hollywood. Close as she's ever been, anyway.

## She tryin' to work your ass against me, ain't she?
Yep.

## Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.

## What does that mean?
You can't trust Melanie. But you can always trust Melanie to be Melanie.

## Did you get it?
I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.

## When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.

## You shot Melanie?
Twice. In the parking lot.

## Couldn't talk to her?
You know how she is.

## You couldn't just hit her?
Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...

## You shot her twice?
Uh-huh.

## Where did you shoot her?
In the chest and stomach.

## How much it there?
Maybe forty, maybe not that much.

## Came outta where?
The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to.

## How long was she in there?
Maybe a minute. She came right out.

## Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
Look, I swear to fucking god, she came out with that bag and I took it from her.

## Then what?
We went to the parking lot.

## You sure she ain't somewhere with a half-a-million dollars I worked my ass off to earn?
Fuck you for asking me that.

## What'd you shoot her with?
It's in there.

## If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.

## You know who I saw in the dress department?
Tell me.

## You gonna tell me who it was?
Hell, yes, they know each other. He bonded her out of county.

## I'm going out for a few hours.
How am I supposed to know that?

## Hold on a minute. Where you going?
I'm going to Del Amo, see a movie, get something to eat.

## Watcha gonna see?
Whatever looks best and starts the soonest.

## Cops can't locate him, huh?
They don't have your winning personality.

## Where would you like me to put my ash?
That's Winston. He works here.

## He's a big one. You two tight?
Yeah.

## So, you want a ten-thousand dollar bond. What've you got for collateral?
Gonna have to put up cash.

## You have it with you?
It's in my bag.

## You have cash. What do you need me for?
Cost you a thousand for the bond.

## Who's it for? A relative?
Ten thousand sounds high.

## What's his full name?
Beaumont. That's the only name I know.

## Livingston, huh?
On his prior, he served nine months, and he's working on four years' probation.

## Do you know what he's on probation for?
Haven't a clue.

## Will they consider this a violation of his probation?
They do consider this a violation of his probation. Your boy's looking at ten years, plus the concealed weapon.

## House or apartment?
House.

## Beaumont ain't going nowhere. Where do I sign?
Hey, Max.

## Comfortable?
The door was opened, so I just came right in.

## I can see that. Why?
I got some more business for ya.

## Oh, yeah? What did he do?
The bond for possession is only a thousand.

## Hear what?
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey, that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out.

## The stewardess. Do you know her last name?
Brown, Jackie Brown.

## What does she do for you?
You're not my client until you get busted and I bond you out.

## If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.

## Falsely accused? She didn't come back from Mexico with cocaine on her?
Falsely accused of Intent. If she had that shit -- and mind you, I said \"if\" -- it was just her shit to get high with.

## Is that what I think it is?
What's up with this shit.

## You know who this is?
Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the ten thousand you put up. Isn't that why you called.

## She got off, huh?
They decided to no-file. Tell me where you are and I'll bring you your money.

## What the fuck you doin' knockin on the door like the goddamn police? You lookin' to get shot?
I thought you might be asleep.

## That's all?
I have a bond receipt for you to sign.

## You know what the fuck I'm talkin' about. You talk to her?
She wants to give you your money. If she didn't, there'd be cops batter- ramming the door right now.

## How'd you find me?
Winston found you.

## How the fuck did he find me?
That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found.

## Well, bully for that nigga. You say she wants to give me the money, huh?
Uh-huh.

## Lift up your pant leg. You help her?
All I did was walk out with it.

## And you did that to protect my interest?
In a way, yes.

## And where's Jackie?
She's been there since Thursday night.

## She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home?
She was afraid.

## You expect me to just walk in there?
Uh-huh.

## By herself. That big mandingo nigga Winston ain't there, is he?
She's all alone.

## My money's in that office, right?
Uh-huh.

## Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?
No.

## You sure?
Yes.

## Get that for me, will ya baby?
You know it's for you.

## Who is it?
It's Beaumont.

## He leave town?
He's around.

## Where do you want to go?
Take me home.

## What are you then?
I'm alive.

## Then what are you doing here?
I don't know. I don't know. This isn't happening.

## Remember?
No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then.

## Della?
You want to see me? Well, here I am.

## What do you want?
Just to see you. That's all.

## Well, how do I look?
Like Della.

## Are you all right?
I'm okay.

## Something weird is going on here. What is it about us? Even in Nam it was always weird. Are we all crazy or something?
Yeah, ever since that ...

## You know, you got a strange line here.
What do you want from me?

## It's short, huh?
Short? It's ended.

## What did he talk about when you guys went out? Did he say anything?
He was upset. He thought people were following him.

## Listen, I just got a strange call from Geary. He said the guys backed down. What's he talking about?
That's right. We did.

## What does that mean, Frank? I don't get it. Why?
It's hard to explain.

## Jesus Christ! Who's been talking to you? What's going on? How can you just turn away? What about the others?
They're not interested, Jake.

## What do you mean?
Maybe there's a larger truth.

## What are you talking about?
Maybe the demons are real.

## Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is that?
Listen, Jake. I gotta go.

## What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
There was a bang.

## Now what?
Don't go.

## Oh yeah? What am I - Perry Mason here?
Doctor. Ph.D.

## Then why aren't you teaching? Why aren't you in a university?
I'm too messed up to teach.

## Nobody's been talking to nobody. You don't have a case, you hear me? It's pure and simple. Now leave me alone. Okay?
Listen, will you listen? They're trying to get me. They're comin' out of the walls. The army's done something to me. I need you.

## Used you?
I talked to the Army's Bureau of Records. You've never even been to Viet Nam.

## What the hell is that supposed to mean?
It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand.

## I don't have to do any such thing. I'm eating my lunch, okay?
Bullshit. Someone's covering somethin'. That was no accident.

## Why do you say that?
Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that.

## What do you mean, demons?
He told me he was going to Hell.

## How long had that been going on?
A couple of weeks, I think.

## He say what they looked like?
No. Not really ...

## You think they're connected?
An explosion, just like Paul's.

## What can I tell you?
I saw Sarah the other day.

## Her knee acting up?
A bit.

## Who?
Sarah.

## She talk about the boys?
She says she can't get them new coats because you haven't sent the alimony for three months.

## God almighty. What did you do to me?
I had to get in there. A deep adjustment. Rest a moment and let it set a bit.

## I don't know. I've been having them recently. You know, you look like an angel, Louis, an overgrown cherub. Anyone ever tell you that?
Louis, you're a life saver.

## Am I dead, Louis? Am I dead?
From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.

## What? By myself?
You can do it. Come on. Easy. Just give it a try.

## What are you doing?
There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.

## I'm walking, aren't I?
Jake, you need to rest.

## Are you in the service?
The postal service. I'm a mailman.

## And how is your wife? Sarah, no?
I haven't seen her in months.

## Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all.

## Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing ... ?
No. I see them.

## See them? What do you mean? Physically?
Yes.

## Have you considered a doctor? A psy- chiatrist?
I don't know what to say.

## Hell, you think I am?
I'd like to speak to Dr. Carlson, please.

## Carlson? Is he new here?
New? He's been here for years.

## Not according to my charts. Do you have an appointment?
Look, I need to see him. I know where his room is. Just give me a pass. I won't be long. Ten minutes.

## What's your name?
Jacob Singer.

## Whataya mean, no record?
You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.

## What was that?
It's freezing.

## What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was?
I don't want to know.

## Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
She was good in bed, though.

## I thought you said it was a nightmare?
I'm not dead. I am not dead.

## My back. I can't move. I need my chiropractor.
Jacob, what can I do?

## Your back? Did you fall?
They stole it.

## Who did?
I don't know. Santa Claus. I had my son's picture in it. Gabe's picture. It's the only one I had.

## We better get an orthopedic man in here. Is Dr. Davis on call?
I'm going to have to move you a bit, just to check for injuries. This may hurt a little.

## Why didn't you turn on the light?
I didn't want to wake you.

## Where are you?
If I knew I wouldn't have to ask. What did you do? I was happy the way it was.

## That help?
Thanks.

## Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
What do you think?

## It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.

## What happened to you?
Don't ask.

## Where'd you leave 'em?
I don't know.

## Did you look around the headboard?
Jezzie, I can't see.

## Thanks. What's that?
Your kid dropped it off.

## Who? Jed?
No. The little one.

## Eli. Why can't you remember their names?
They're weird names.

## And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
I don't let anybody call me that.

## You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny?
You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.

## Yeah, but for what?
Pictures. Your wife was gonna toss 'em so \"what's his name\" brought 'em over on his way to school.

## What?
Why you left.

## What do you mean you can see?
Look at her face. A real bitch.

## Is that the one who died?
Gabe.

## Ready?
I'm going home.

## What's wrong?
I don't know. One of these days, I'm gonna see Louis. My back's killing me.

## Why do you bring her up?
Cause she's always on your mind.

## When was the last time I said a word?
It has nothin' to do with talkin'.

## What does that have to do with anything? Does it explain the barricaded subway stations? Does it explain those Godforsaken creatures?
I wanna leave. Get me out of here.

## Where are we?
We're at Della's.

## Hey, I'm here.
Where?

## Can't you stop it?
If I could stop it, I'd stop it.

## What's it say? A hundred and two?
I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.

## What does it say?
It's gone to the top.

## How high is that?
The numbers stop at 107.

## What the hell are you doin'?
That you'd die on the way to the hospital. Now get into that tub.

## Coming here?
Goddamn it. Get in here. I can't stand around waiting.

## What kind of man are you?
Don't gimme that.

## So tell me ... am I still an angel?
With wings. You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.

## He did? When?
While you were in the shower.

## Why didn't you call me?
He didn't give me a chance. Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case.

## What? What do you mean?
He said you didn't have one.

## What's he talking about?
I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said.

## Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?
Stay away from me, Jez.

## Who was that?
A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.

## How?
I have no idea. I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.

## How do you know he's telling the truth?
I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.

## Are you out of your mind?
Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.

## What's gotten into you?
I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.

## What're you ... ? Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
Sit down, Jake.

## Where are they?
Sit down.

## No! What's going on? Where's my family?
It's over, Jake. It's all over.

## Where have they gone?
Wake up. Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.

## What's going on?
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.

## YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
What's wrong, Jake? Forget to take your antidote?

## So tell me ... am I still an angel?
With wings. You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.

## Why won't you answer me?
Cause you know goddamn well who I am.

## What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?
I'm okay. I just don't want to lis- ten.

## Jake, what is it?
I'm tired.

## Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.

## Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
You can have anything you want.

## I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage. Where'd you go today?
Mid-town mostly.

## Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
I picked up my ticket. I'm leaving in the morning, Jez.

## Oh? Where you going?
West.

## Where's West? New Jersey?
Don't be funny.

## Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
Sit down, Jake.

## No! What's going on? Where's my family?
It's over, Jake. It's all over.

## Where have they gone?
Wake up! Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.

## Surprised, huh? I told you you'd know me. I've been tracking you for a long time. I just wish I'd spoken to you before tonight.
WHO ARE YOU?

## I don't get it. Who are you? Why have you been following me?
Observation, mainly. Clinical study. You were one of the survivors.

## The Ladder?
Like it was yesterday.

## But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?
Yeah. But not with the Cong.

## Who then?
I always suspected the effects might come back. That's why I had to follow you. I had a hell of a time getting hold of your records.

## You come here often?
Sometimes. When it's convenient.

## How do I know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something?
Hey, I'm not the problem. You've got bigger problems than me.

## Never?
I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just open your mouth and stick out your tongue.

## What is it?
Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.

## One drop?
It's strong stuff.

## Where's Wong?
That's what I'd like to know. If you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired.

## Hot. Where do I sign?
You got a nice tan, though.

## Tan? What tan? It faded on the airplane. I'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask? Two hundred dollars a night, for what?
No. I'll take the other one. Right. Well it's good to have you back. See you tomorrow, probably.

## For what? For seeking the truth?
Please come quietly.

## Where am I?
Lennox Hospital.

## I'm awake?
You look awake to me. Here. Drink some of this.

## Of course it is. What else could it be?
Hello.

## Jacob Singer?
A long time.

## Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life?
Nothin' much.

## Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor?
I need to see you, Jake.

## You're lucky. How many vets you know are even employed?
Count 'em on one hand.

## It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it.

## Still married, Jake?
Nope.

## Why the hell we drivin' here?
I just need to talk.

## You can't talk in Brownsville?
I'm not sure where I can talk anymore.

## That black car?
Pull the mirror down on the sun visor. Just watch 'em.

## What's goin' on Paul?
I don't know.

## You in trouble?
Yeah.

## Who is?
Sorry. Sometimes I think I'm just gonna jump outta my skin. They're just drivin' me wild.

## Why not?
They're waitin' for me, that's why.

## You've seen them?
Everywhere, like a plague.

## The army?
I don't know. I don't know.

## What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?
Are you kidding? We've put up more of her cousins. You wouldn't believe how they breed down there.

## I'm looking for Dr. Carlson. Isn't this his office?
I'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't ... Dr. Carlson died.

## Died?
A car accident.

## Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
Last month, before Thanksgiving.

## How did it happen?
No one knows. They say it blew up.

## Do you want me to get someone?
No. No. It's okay. I'm okay.

## Is he all right?
He doesn't like it.

## I don't blame him. What should I do with the ice?
Pour it in.

## On top of him?
He's melting it as fast as we dump it in.

## Punk?
Pause play.

## Duck fuckers?
Just make a break for the door. He'll get some of us, but that's the breaks.

## What's that?
THat's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship.

## Can we blow it with just two?
If we don't sever the hull completely she'll drag us down with her.

## What?
I don't know. Nothing.

## We made it?
The ship's depressurizing, the engines overheating. When it reaches the core, we're done.

## Done?
Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue ship on radar.

## Bomb?
Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.

## Blowing the walkway? You come up with that yourself?
Rizzo did.

## You see that?
Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage.

## Everyone okay?
I think I broke my arm.

## What are you gonna do, tell me?
I'll need system four converters.

## Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?
We'd need charges.

## Faster! Don't we have another gun?
Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.

## What the hell are you doing?
My job.

## Yllo, what's your head count?
Looks like we're missing two. Stone and Kkinsa.

## At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?
Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.

## What?
I'm with you kid.

## Where is he?
Negative.

## Give me a break! What happened?
We have to get off this ship.

## Isn't there an escape POD on this ship? Something?
Rizzo, he's out there.

## Kkinsa, Crutch is hurt! We need access to the shuttle's med-kit or he'll die.
Guys!!! The shuttle?

## Med-kit?
It's the engine, reactors, audiometers, it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom.

## Were you close to your father?
They were all wrong. They couldn't control him.

## And what happend to ...?
I couldn't save them.

## Well, we'd be dead without you. You know that, don't you?
See? We're not so bad.

## You?
Wait around on your asses all day. I'll need a distraction.

## Got it. You ever space walked?
Oh sure, all the time.

## You wanna release your air tanks?
Okay, good tip.

## Rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time?
I think I had some when I was eight.

## I think so, why?
No thank you, you crazy old woman.

## Old woman?
Well I mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...

## Now what?
We wait. I need about fifteen. Call me if there are any changes. If she farts I want a full report.

## What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
She needs a little time.

## I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
Yeah, like you'd be a rock after everything she went through?

## Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe.

## Kay-Em, you've saved our lives, you know that don't you?
Oh, shit. He's going to see us.

## And what's with the headgear?
The mask is an artifact from a sport outlawed in twenty-twelve.

## Then do it. The rescue ship can find us here right?
I knew you were a little sick, but Geez.

## Small brains make your balls itch?
YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job.

## Would you?
You're so bossy.

## You're leaving me here alone?
You're quicker than usual.

## What are you doing?
I'll tell you where he is. He's walking around this ship, killing anything that moves.

## Teleportation? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge?
Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.

## I don't know...sorry?
Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.

## Robot huh?
Kay-em 14.

## Are there any other shuttles?
Sumbitch won't be giving us anymore trouble.

## I'll never experience my fantasy of three sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod. Damn.
You killed him?

## Am I in there?
Sory...

## Who are you apologizing to?
Good point.

## Do I have to?
Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.

## Kay-Em, you okay?
Don't worry about me. I live for this shit.

## Kay-em you okay?
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.

## I don't understand...what does he want?
He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone on this ship.

## What?
Ssh.

## How do you know?
We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found.

## I'll reset our course ... 3 hours?
See you then ... doctor.

## How did I get here, how did you bring me back?
Nanotechnology.

## 30? How long was I out?
Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some questions...

## But...I...400 years?
That's right, now if you could...

## Are you finished?
Jason! Can't you see? He did this.

## You're not going anywhere.
Azrael can you repeat that?

## What good will that do?
They can deal with this sort of thing.

## More soldiers?
Scientists. Very intellegent men.

## Three...two...one...
How do you open the damn door?

## The hockey player? He a friend of yours?
What have I done?! Idiots.

## So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces?
Exactly.

## Cut my hand. Hit by a vampire.
Can we get through these?

## I want him out of the ocean.
On the swing? I told you not to play near there until I sanded it down. See what your son did?

## You're not going to the ocean with that, are you son?
I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.

## Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?
I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.

## Who's driving the boat?
Nobody. We're drifting with the current.

## Why are we way out here, when the shark's back there?
...'cause this is where he lives. You gotta think like they do.

## Don't tell me my business! Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle.
You got it?

## How -- if they're gonna keep on breaking?
I never saw one that big.

## What do we do? Get some help? Radio in?
Why don't we go in? Get another crack at him tomorrow.

## What's that one, there?
Tattoo. Had it taken off.

## What about us?
cause when we bought the house it was Autumn. This is summer. Feed the dogs.

## Do you see the kids?
Like you're from N'Yawk.

## Oh, yeah. How do I look? Older, huh?
I think they make you look sexy.

## Sexy, hm? What was I before?
Older, sillier.

## Can you stand something to eat?
Love a cup of tea. With lemon.

## Where is he?
He's sitting in it.

## How come you have to tell them that?
Excuse me, but what are you talking about? Didn't they catch the shark this afternoon? It was on the Cape station news.

## Home... New York?
No. Home here.

## You going to be all right?
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.

## Do I need any more authority?
Now tell me something I don't know.

## So we should set out a smorgasbord?
I don't think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things.

## Who's that young man?
Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute.

## What kind of a shark did you say it was?
I don't thing either of you is familiar with our problems...

## Why?
There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor.

## Who are you?
Hooper, Matt Hooper. From the Oceanographic Institute.

## You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch this?
I didn't say this wasn't the shark, I just said I wasn't sure this was the one...

## Dynamite! How was your day...?
Swell.

## Drowning. Lemme ask you something. Is it true most attacks take place in three feet of water, around 10 feet from the beach?
Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark they caught...

## Something else. Do most attacks go unreported?
About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims.

## Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where there's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts?
It's called Territoriality. It's a theory.

## What stinks so bad?
Our friend, the shark.

## Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
What's that?

## How can you tell?
Florida license plate.

## He ate a car?
No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean. They eat anything. But this one didn't eat any people. There's nothing here...

## What do we do?
If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. You go out and chum for him.

## What is all this stuff?
Depth-finder, fathometer, sonar, closed-circuit TV -- fore and aft -- RDF, single side band... And two loose nuts behind the wheel.

## Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around?
Sometimes. Look here -- something big, probably a school of mackerel clumped together. And staying right with us.

## Where'd you get all this?
I Bought it. Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so I don't have to touch my principal.

## We gotta get back soon...
You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job?

## What happened?
I want to check something. Hold my feet.

## Don't they have lifejackets or something? An extra boat?
They must've hit something.

## Why don't we just tow it in?
We will. There's something I've got to find out.

## You all right?
No shark did that to a boat!

## What's that, a ship?
You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus...

## What the hell?
Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.

## Think the tide's with us?
Just keep kicking.

## Christine what?
Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one ever died on me before.

## And nobody else saw her in the water?
Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.

## Think she might've run out on you?
Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned.

## You from around here?
No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's in Tuxedo, New York, though.

## You here for the summer?
Some friends and me took a house.

## What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
A thousand apiece, something like that. There's five of us. And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that.

## We never had any. What's the problem?
Get out of there  take these back to the office and make up some 'Beach Closed' signs, and let Polly do the printing.

## What's the matter with my printing?
That wasn't funny.

## I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. These are some of the steps I've taken as Chief of Police...
What else could've done that?

## It's only two-thirty. What, are you tired?
Yeah, Charlie, I got my second wind three nibbles back.

## One more after this, then I'm going home.
Leg of lamb this time?

## You do this all the time, right, Charlie?
Twenty years.

## Is anyone having this...?
My husband tells me you're in sharks.

## You love sharks?
I do. But you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere.

## Is that a boat?
Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.

## I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?
Yep.

## ...push this? Oh. It's working. Hello, Martin?
This is Quint, Missus.

## I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
He's busy.

## Well... is everything all right?
Just fine, Missus. We'll be back soon. Everything's fine. We haven't seen anything yet. Orca out.

## What have you got there, Lenny?
We had a shark attack at South Chop this morning, Mayor. Fatal. Gotta batten down the beach.

## Who've you told this to, Lenny?
-- and an America's Cup Trials...

## What's that supposed to prove?
Just a little appetizer. I want our porker to know we're serving. I want to put some iron into that big yap...

## That's pilot whale, isn't it?
At least you handle the boat all right. Stop. Here... Cut the engine.

## Ever see one like this?
Bull shark scraped me while I was taking samples...

## Don't tell me -- 'Death Before Dishonor.' 'Mother.' 'Semper Fi.' Uhhh... 'Don't Tread on Me.' C'mon -- what?
Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine nitrate. If I can hit him. I can kill him. But I gotta be close. Very close.

## Is that tooth here? Did anyone see it?
I don't have it.

## Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?
I don't think so.

## Go Carole. So, guess what?
I don't know...

## So, what do you think we should do?
Yeah, typically. That's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant.

## So that's cool with you, then?
Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do what you think is right.

## I'll see you at school, O.K.?
Well! Nothing like experimenting.

## Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.

## Charisma?
Or something.

## What's up?
I just wanted to come over. You know, say hi. I miss hanging out with you on school nights.

## Really? What are they like?
The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today.

## Is that normal?
I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks, so we should be safe.

## I'm going to really start looking like a dork soon. Will you still think I'm cute if I'm huge?
I always think you're cute. I think you're beautiful.

## Were we together?
Well, we were once. You know, that time.

## Um, hi?
Leah just told me you were going with her.

## You're mad. Why are you mad?
Katrina's not my girlfriend! And I doubt she was actually giving you the stinkeye. She just looks like that all the time.

## What? Are you ashamed that we did it?
No...

## Huh?
You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it.

## Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox?
Yeah. That was me.

## Why?
Because they're your fave. And you can never have too much of your favorite one-calorie breath mint.

## What, you mean as friends?
No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.

## That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
It does?

## Can we make out now?
Okay.

## Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?
Yup.

## Did you hear it's yours?
Yup.

## Wait, what's that supposed to mean?
I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here. It's obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in.

## I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.

## Just tell it to me straight, Bren. Do you think this is my fault? Her mother's fault?
I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.

## Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.

## Hon, did you get expelled?
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.

## Where the hell have you been, Junebug?
I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours.

## You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?
That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a married stranger. You overstepped a boundary.

## Ow, ow, fuckity-ow. Bren, when do I get that Spinal Tap thing?
It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.

## You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?
Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.

## Shit. Hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?
It really didn't hurt that bad having him.

## So, Juno. First off, how far along are you?
I'm a junior.

## Well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?
Shit, yeah. Close it up.

## Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?
Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament.

## What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?
I don't get a klepto vibe from you. Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't rule it out.

## Viscera?
Blood and guts.

## What do you play?
I rock a Harmony.

## What is that, Mahogany? What happens if you crack the neck?
Yeah.

## When was this, like '96?
Yeah.

## I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
No, she's working late tonight. She's trying to accrue some extra time off for when, you know...

## Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs... ...They're not bad.

## Why aren't you at work?
I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.

## No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
No, more commercial stuff.

## Like what?
Commercials.

## I wrote that.
Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?

## You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?
They'd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home.

## Oh, is he bald and amorphous?
No, he's the dad.

## Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?
The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.

## Junk?
You know... it's parts...

## Yeah?
We definitely want it to have junk.

## What is it?
It's only my favorite song. It's Sonic Youth doing \"Superstar\" by the Carpenters.

## It's the least I can do. What did you say your favorite band was?
I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.

## The Wizard of Gore?
Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.

## So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?
Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.

## God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh?
That suits you.

## Juno was nice enough to bring this by for us.
Why? What the big deal?

## Yeah. Mall madness, huh?
I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.

## Why?
Cold feet.

## Hello?
So, I've been spending a lot of time listening to that weird CD you made me.

## Oh really? What's the verdict?
I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.

## Cute?
Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.

## Is Vanessa here?
Nope. We're safe.

## What?
I actually know this one.

## You do?
Yeah, this song's older than me, if you can believe that. I danced to it at my senior prom.

## That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?
Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.

## You've never been to a dance, have you?
Only squares and nerds go to dances.

## What are you?
I don't know.

## What?
No.

## I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?
I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.

## Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?
That's not the point. We're just not in love anymore.

## Good. I'm good. Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?
No, not yet. I tried to work on it a little last night, but I'm having trouble concentrating.

## Really? Fingernails?
Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa.

## Can I take your coats?
Sure.

## You found us in the Penny Saver?
I'll get drinks. What would everyone like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin Water...

## Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost into your second trimester, then?
Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.

## So, then, you really think you're going to go ahead with this?
I'm going to say I'm 104% sure.

## Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong?
Nothing...

## Then what's going on?
I went to the doctor today.

## Is the baby okay?
Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this...

## What do you mean? You mean... Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
No, no, I don't think that, Juno. It's just that, we went through a situation before where it didn't work out.

## Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?
Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.

## Um... Juno, can I -- Can I touch it?
Are you kidding? Everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly. I'm like a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale.

## Juno? What's going on?
Nothing.

## Mark? Why is Juno crying?
I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine home furnishings. See you later.

## Your name, please?
Juno MacGuff.

## Do you need a large sum of money? Legal counsel?
No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.

## Who is the kid?
The baby? I don't know anything about it yet. I only know it's got fingernails, allegedly.

## No, it's not. Paulie is virile, by the way. He was very good in... chair.
What?

## Did you say you were thinking about adoption?
Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years.

## Excuse me?
Hi Dad.

## Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.

## You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
I'm losing my faith in humanity.

## You mean like couples?
Please stop now.

## Tore up from the floor up?
I think the last one was defective. The plus sign looked more like a division sign.

## So what's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle? Minus or plus?
I don't know. It's not... seasoned yet. Wait. Huh. Yeah, there's that pink plus sign again. God, it's unholy.

## No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting?
Only the one in my pants.

## Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch?
It's not a food baby. I took three pregnancy tests today. I am definitely up the spout.

## How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests?
I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.

## Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
Unfortunately, yes.

## So, you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be?
Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.

## When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?
Like, a year ago, in Spanish class.

## Oh, gruesome. I wonder if the baby's claws could scratch your vag on the way out?
I'm staying pregnant, Le.

## There are ads? For parents?
Come on, Leah. I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! That's tacky. That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch.

## What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?
Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids!

## Aw, please Junebug?
No way. No, I definitely don't want to know.

## What?
That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.

## Of the Penny Saver Lorings?
No way! She's pretty.

## God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now?
Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.

## Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.

## What do you make with that?
You don't make anything. It's for exercising.

## Are you looking for any other compensation?
Juno just wanted a closer look at Kimber here.

## What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?
You should read the book. I even flagged the \"daddy chapters\" for you.

## Juno, what's the matter?
She's hormonal. Right, June? It's just part of the whole process.

## What did you do?
I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.

## What?
Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.

## What are you referring to?
I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.

## Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay?
She answered our prayers.

## What would be a good time for you?
I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.

## Like what? Be a rock star?
Don't mock me.

## We're actually, finally doing this?
Looks like it, yeah.

## Have you found a place to stay?
Yeah, downtown.

## A hotel?
It's a loft.

## Aren't you the cool guy?
No.

## Carrie.
Me neither. How 'bout you Carrie?

## ...Pardon?
...I said, I like your hair.

## What?
Karma... You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.

## Are you takin' the pictures?
...Yeah.

## Is it hard to learn?
Not really.

## You wouldn't have any color film, would ya?
...Yeah, sure.

## ...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before?
I haven't... I'm a fast learner.

## You can?
I'm cool.

## What's this?
It's a portfolio of my work.

## Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
Sure.

## You took this picture?
Took 'em all.

## You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
Yeah.

## What's Early been in jail for?
Carryin' a gun.

## ...Anything else?
An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.

## Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there.
What?

## What's up Adele? Dinner ready?
Almost.

## What'll we do out there?
You know... I read once... Ain't nothin' on that big old moon 'cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind.

## What if they're dangerous?
They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.

## Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?
Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now.

## How many times you gonna tell me that?
As many times as it takes.

## What the hell is this stuff?
It's Chinese food. It was the only place open. You said you was starving, you'd eat anyth...

## Yeah but, what is it?
I don't know, they didn't speak too good English.

## Thank you for what? What are you thanking me for Adele?
She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen.

## What's your name, boy?
Walter Livesy.

## Not so good. You sure you have to?
I don't know. Wish I did.

## Where you from Walter?
Vernon, Florida.

## Never heard of it, any huntin'?
Turkey mostly.

## You think I'm goin' to kill you. Well that'd make me a liar then wouldn't it?
No sir.

## So what do you do Early?
Oh... I do some work up at the Merrick Mirror factory, or I used to...

## You gonna talk to the people who did those murders?
That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.

## How much do I owe you?
Forget it.

## This the book your writing?
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.

## Who?
Henry Lucas.

## How did he get away with it for so long anyhow?
He almost always killed strangers. Spent years moving on from one place to another. That made it real hard to track him down.

## That bad?
...Then some.

## ...They never caught that Black Dolya Killer, huh?
Dahlia, no.

## Now why is that?
Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society.

## That your... \"theory\", ain't that what they call it?
Yeah.

## You wanna hear mine?
Sure.

## Ain't you goin' to record it?
By the way, I'm not much of a pool player.

## Yeah?
Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few points first game.

## Nah... how much money have you got?
...Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it.

## Hey... Ain't we getting near the next murder site... Bri?
Forget about it, doesn't matter.

## So tell me... what happened here?
Two brothers, prospectors, lived here. Up until a few years back.

## ...and?
They picked up hitchhikers... young men... and brought them back here.

## What happened to Adele?
Well, let's put it this way. I need me a new woman.

## Who do I have to blow to get out of here?
A... I gotta go.

## The party?
The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.

## ...just like that?
Just like that. Load up the Lincoln... point it West... stop when we hit the fucking ocean.

## Thanks. What are you doing?
Well, I sat down with my tapes and your photographs, which are great by the way... and I started writing.

## So how's it going?
...I think it's the best stuff I've done.

## Why?
Because I was there. And for a moment that night I understood how she came to pull the trigger.

## This mean your finally going to finish your thesis?
Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.

## A book on the warehouse murders?
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.

## I still think we should have met them first.
What did he sound like on the phone?

## Hey, I got some great stuff... it's okay.
Beggars can't be choosers. They were the only ones who answered the ride share note, remember?

## You mean because I object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I'm eating I'm prejudiced?
He can't help the way he was raised. I kinda feel sorry for him.

## I don't want to talk about it.
Feel sorry for him? Obviously you didn't get a whiff of that sock?

## Take your time.
All set?

## Who said he's my good buddy?
You sure been acting like you were... ...Out whoopin' it up, a drankin' and ever' thang.

## She told me... ...but only when she \"deserves\" it. Did you know he was in jail?
A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything.

## What are you going to do?
I'm going to try and lift the end of the piano. If I can... slide your cuffs free.

## What about you?
I don't know.

## Any word from that gallery?
Not yet.

## Nervous?
...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries.

## You mean 'Ted Bundy's' finally agreed to leave?
...Soon as he finishes his thesis.

## Where's Adele?
She wasn't feeling so good.

## ...Need a hand with those bags?
No, thanks, I can manage.

## Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?
...Brian hurt his foot.

## Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that?
No.

## ...never?
No, never. Excuse me.

## ...You know what I mean?
...I know I'd love to smash this bottle right in your fucking face.

## What is it?
...Janitor's job.

## Who are you?
His Parole Officer.

## Right, I talked to you on the phone. They say it's a torch job, that sound like your boy?
Could be.

## Where would we find him?
Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to Texas.

## What about the owner of the house... ...this John Diebold, any idea where he might be?
No, but I can tell you he's not gonna be too happy about this.

## ...Diebold?
...That'd be my guess.

## How old you?
17.

## Umm. Altogether?
Yes. Altogether.

## How many times have you gone unprotected?
With four of them, I didn't use any kind of protection. Wait, maybe it was three.

## Have you ever had anal intercourse?
Yes.

## With how many people?
Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure.

## Were they wearing condoms?
Uh. Yes. Twice they weren't. Two times they didn't.

## Who am I? Who am I? The mothafuckin' virgin surgeon.
Was up bitch?

## Well, how was it?
Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.

## She can fuck?
Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.

## How long did you fuck her?
Yeah.

## How did she smell? Did her puss stink?
Oh man, it smells like butterscotch.

## What?
I can tell that she had just entered puberty.

## How?
Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.

## To what? Virgins?
Yeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's like lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex fantasies.

## What do you mean?
I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.

## Did you tell her that you loved her?
Like. Like. Never love. Love is for low-level virgin seduction guys.

## What do you want?
Get another forty. Smoke a blunt.

## Are you hungry?
Hell yeah. Fuckin' starvin'. Wait up a sec.

## You wanna go to Paul's house?
What for? That guys a dick.

## You think he's got any herb?
I don't know, he quit dealin' but I'll bet he'll smoke us out.

## You think?
Probably.

## He lives on 76th?
78th.

## Did she suck your dick?
A little bit. But I didn't really want her to.

## Why?
I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.

## It's no big deal, right?
Yeah, I feel dehydrated.

## You got any money?
Three pennies and a ball of lint.

## You down with the boost?
Unzip my pack, yo.

## The cartoon?
Yeah. \"The Wonder Twins\". You know. Activate in the form of, a glass of water.

## Well, those guys share everything, right?
Right.

## Man I haven't seen her in forever. What the fuck's she up to?
But that's the thing. Girl's like it slow. They like romance. They like things to be sweet and romantic.

## Who?
Darcy. Benny's little sister.

## Oh. You like her?
Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now.

## Darcy?
Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent.

## It's funny. Last weekend at that block party. Remember?
Yeah.

## You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? Get zooted?
I guess so. I gotta stop off home too.

## Why I do what?
That.

## Why I give pennies?
Yeah. Why you give money.

## What are you talking about?
So. You never know when you can end up like that.

## Good luck?
Yeah, good luck. I mean what the fuck. The guy had no legs.

## I don't know. How much do you want?
About ten. Fifteen is good.

## You think Darcy is gonna be at Nasa tonight?
Yeah probably.

## Yo, you got any weed around here?
Naw. But we should run by the park and get a dime. Maybe Darcy will be at the park.

## You are?
Yeah. The other day, some sort of Chinese bitch told me I'd look good with muscles.

## Hey Jennie. Long time no see. What are you doing here?
Casper, where's Telly.

## Casper, where is he?
Don't look for him. He's doing fine. He's gotta girl. He's fuckin' her right now in Steven's parents' room. So do ya know Joe.

## Casper! Was up kid?
Nothen' B.

## Where you at?
Right here.

## Where you goin' tonight?
Maybe Nasa. I don't know.

## You goin'?
Yeah.

## I'm goin'. You on the list?
Probably. Fuck that, I'll sneak in. I need some female vagina tonight.

## Yo, you think we killed that guy?
Na.

## You sure?
I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.

## Yo, we might have killed him. You think?
Man we fucked him up.

## Yeah watch the fuck where you skate. You know what I'm saying?
Yeah, watch where you walk dukes.

## What?
Nuffin' G. Just forget it.

## Sup then? Sup?
Come on bitch. Throw your fists up.

## Hey. What are you doin' right now?
I was just getting ready to take a bath.

## Right now?
Yeah. Come on.

## Is it cold?
You know I've been thinking about you lately.

## You have?
Yeah. After I saw you last week.

## At the block party?
Yeah.

## You were?
Sure. I even thought about you when I woke up.

## Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.

## She won't? Why not?
Yeah. I can understand that.

## Tonight?
Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.

## Yeah?
Yeah. It'll be nice. It'll be a change of pace. That club shit gets boring.

## Do you like kissing me?
Yes.

## How do you know?
I just know. I know you'll love it.

## Nothing?
Nothing. I'm telling you I just want to make you happy. That's all. Just trust me.

## Do you care about me?
Of course I do.

## Fine Fidget. What's all this?
Oh man. You gotta see this. It's a spectacle. A real spectacle.

## Who are they?
I don't know. I've never seen any of them before. Cornballs from Jersey on X. Feelin' the effex.

## What is it?
Bang up stuff.

## You know what I want to do?
Yeah.

## What do I want to do?
You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.

## Why?
Because, you know why. You know.

## Because your a virgin?
Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.

## Why is that?
Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.

## I wouldn't believe it?
I don't know. I just think that you would love it.

## Do you care about me?
Come dance.

## I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?
Telly is at Steven's. There's a bunch of people over there. Come on dance.

## Telly is at Steven's?
I guess so.

## How old are you?
15.

## How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
One.

## Have you ever had anal intercourse?
No.

## What?
The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should...

## I tested positive?
I'm sorry.

## What?
No. I'm OK. Thanks.

## You're OK?
Yeah.

## Miss, would I be prying?
Everything is wrong.

## No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?
Yeah, I guess so.

## Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
No.

## Are you in trouble with the law?
No.

## Am I getting warm?
Now that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you smile. Like a glamour girl.

## Yeah?
Thanks.

## Yeah?
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.

## What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
Your a real philosopher.

## Is Telly there? This is Paul. Who is this?
It's Jennie. Just tell me if Telly is there.

## I'm fucking serious. Where's Telly?
Telly's not here right now. I believe he went downtown. Casper too.

## I know.
You still mad at him?

## Did you bleed?
I didn't bleed.

## You didn't?
No, I didn't bleed.

## Mine?
Mine are like my neck and my chest.

## Yeah. Have you seen Telly around?
Yeah. Speaking of stupid shit. Him and his ape ass of a friend Casper, they all just almost killed some kid.

## What happened?
I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit.

## Do you know where he went?
I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.

## OWNER Whah is dissdee?
Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg.

## OWNER Whah you say? Dissdee?
Yeah. And sex is just like, yeah let's have sex.

## You know... You know a lot of times sex gets in the way. Has that ever happened to you?
Yep.

## Have you ever swallowed it before?
Yep. That's the best way. It's that boom boom boom.

## Did they ask you a lot of questions?
How can you hang out with Casper? He's such a jerk.

## You think so?
Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.

## You've heard the stories right?
No.

## Holy shit. That's all true?
No. I was just kidding.

## Hi Telly. Where you been?
Sorry. Dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job.

## When are you gonna be back?
Not too late.

## Four-thirty in the morning?
Not too late.

## Hello?
It's me. Telly.

## Hello?
Paul it's Telly. Open up.

## What are you guys doing?
Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.

## You want a wip-it?
Nah.

## So, how many people live here now?
I don't know, eight or nine.

## Where does everyone sleep?
Yeah. I had sex with Jake, and it took him like an hour and a half.

## What man? What is it?
Yo, let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while.

## Shit. All right. But don't fuck with anything OK?
OK.

## I've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly?
Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes. People have a lot of free time. They like to gossip.

## By yourself?
Yes.

## What kind of problem?
I think you're lying. That's what kind of problem.

## What are you saying?
Casual.

## It wasn't serious. What's your problem?
You are! I don't like you.

## What's that supposed to mean?
It means, if I were a killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them off the scent.

## You like to play games, don't you, Peter?
He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven. Why not come back then and listen for yourself.

## What do you mean, no?
He says it's a game. All games have a strategy.

## Are you crazy?
Let's see how much he wants to play.

## You know, I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it. You think I'm right?
I wouldn't know.

## How'd you get in here?
The door was open.

## You ever do any hunting, Peter?
No.

## What if he doesn't bite? What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
Well then, you just gotta find out where he is -- and once you're sure where he is -- you shoot the fucker.

## Then what's he talking about?
If we knew that we'd know the answer to the riddle, wouldn't we? He's telling us where he's going to kill tonight and we can't see it.

## You sure you weren't over on Pine Road?
I want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer.

## What's the first street?
Sorry to ruin your trip to the city, but we got a real nut on our hands, Frank.

## Local?
No. She just moved here last month from Portland.

## What do you think?
He's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi.

## You think he's dirty?
I don't know, but I think you're right. He's lying.

## What was your relationship with her?
Sorry.

## Anything?
The F.B.I. has nothing remotely similar to this guy. I think he's a first- timer.

## You still having a problem with this?
We've checked. There's no one with the last name of Emma on the Island.

## How is she?
She's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it.

## I've seen a lot of things in my time on the job, but nothing like this. Yurilivich?
I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel.

## Sanderson?
I spoke to Jeremy. He's watching Sanderson's kid. Sanderson went out after the match and hasn't come back since.

## What is it?
It's a voice modulator.

## Ready for round two?
I've got a feeling we're going to go the distance with him. Let him sweat for a little while.

## Sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today?
I don't know. Maybe there's two of them. Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.

## Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
Did anyone stand out?

## What was suspicious about him?
It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it.

## Who is this?
Someone who's going to become an important part of your life. I want to play a game with you.

## Yes. Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?
To get your attention.

## Did you know her?
No, only the path she chose to travel.

## And -- what path is that?
We all have paths to follow. You hope yours will lead you to me.

## Why did you write remember on the wall?
That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself. Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.

## Why not?
You don't want to think and that's why I'll win! I'm already two points ahead.

## What?
I did another one last night. You might have saved her, but you didn't want to play.

## Where is she?
Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter? I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.

## You know her?
Not really.

## Why her?
Because she's the type.

## Just like who?
I really wish you'd stop trying to maneuver me. I find it irritating, not to mention insulting.

## And you want these girls to feel your pain?
Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game.

## How?
I couldn't say it any better than Huxley.

## If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
I couldn't tell you that. It would ruin the game. Not that you're playing it very well.

## What makes you think I was there?
I couldn't tell you that. It would ruin the game.

## Last night was very exciting, wasn't it? Have you figured out what I'm doing?
You're playing the Tarakoss opening.

## The police haven't told you?
They think that you and I are doing this together.

## Yes?
Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds. It's check, Peter.

## Very good. How did you know?
The pipes.

## How'd you know I wouldn't be in the same room with her?
You told me. When you called you said she was in the other room. Drop the knife.

## What's this?
Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter. I hope you don't mind.

## Can we correlate data? Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
No problem. We're in.

## Set up some pieces on the big board?
Mister Sanderson, they'll be hundreds of thousands of games.

## Now what?
Have computer search for anyone that's used that opening against me. There can't be more than a handful.

## What is it?
New York. 1986. Viktor Yurilivich.

## Computers. That's how you got into Homesearchers records. You can get into anything. But why? Why?
You still haven't figured it out, have you? You think that I've put you through an ordeal. My scars run so much deeper than yours.

## What scars?
The scars on your chest. From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen.

## The police came to me for help. What could I do?
I just can't believe it.

## Why did he what?
Come here.

## Yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't? What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
You're losing me.

## So, are you having a good time on the Island?
Not really. It's pretty boring.

## That's only because you don't know where to go. You like hiking? Fishing? Sailing? What do you like?
Boys.

## Do you like my dad?
Of course.

## How do you know that? Did he say something?
No... but I can tell. A woman knows these things.

## What are you doing up?
I can't sleep. My beds lumpy.

## I see. You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
That has nothing to do with it.

## You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
Okay.

## Who told you that?
Mrs. Lutz. She also told me that Mr. Lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great Grandmasters in the spirit world.

## Has he gotten through to any?
No, but he did contact a dead parcheesi champion from Ohio.

## What is it, dad?
Nothing.

## Don't you have something you want to say to David?
Thanks, David.

## For what?
You told me you'd take me over to Seattle today.

## Whaddaya got, Nolan?
Not much. There's no sign of a break in. I think she let him in.

## How long has she been dead?
Six, eight hours tops.

## Any sign of rape?
Not that I can see. We'll know more once I get the lab reports back from Seattle.

## There's no blood. Where's the fuckin' blood?
Bingo.

## What about prints?
No prints.

## You mean, no prints but hers?
No Frank. No prints.

## There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island. We'll check that out. What about the blood?
Not a drop. Maybe the guy works for the Red Cross.

## Same as the others?
Yeah.

## How long she been dead?
I'd say at least eighteen hours.

## Well?
Well what? I told you this was a stupid idea. You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.

## Only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to Sanderson for some case you're working on. What'd he do?
We're not sure.

## What do you think he did?
No. I told him to. I wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end.

## Meaning?
His home would be... Mount Olympus.

## He moves around a lot. Why?
Each of those grids represents almost a square mile.

## What time did he get there?
About a quarter to one.

## What are you saying? That I'm seeing what I want to see? That I'm protecting a murderer? What?
We can't rely on your judgement anymore.

## What does that mean?
No. He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist. It was Peter.

## I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist. Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late.

## Excuse me... you said earlier that Mary Albert just moved in. How long ago was that?
Ten days ago.

## Do you know how she found the apartment?
Through a rental agency.

## I know you're busy so I'll get right to it. Did you know her?
Only in passing. To say hello to.

## Could you tell me where you were last night?
Here. I played Gregory Lutz.

## I know. You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five. Where did you go after that?
To my room and then I went for a walk.

## Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier?
I don't know. I was afraid there'd be hours of questions. I can't afford to miss a game.

## What have you come up with on the riddle?
\"Wee Willie Winkie runs though the street.\" We think he might be making a reference to himself.

## That's it?
We think he might be making a reference to drugs? Miss Emma is a street term used by junkies for Morphine.

## \"Is\". Did you tell him about the institute?
As large as castles. You are still light as air, one hundred men can't move me.

## A building isn't as light as air. What's large, but as light as air and can't be moved?
He's not going to give us direct hints. He's going to skirt around it.

## Are we going to go through this again?
Answer the question.

## Did you send the car?
It's over, Peter. Let's stop the games. I'm not sending a car.

## I suppose you have something in mind?
It's a good play, but risky.

## We got a problem?
Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.

## Is it serious?
Peter...

## You have something you want to say?
Just thought you might want to talk.

## About what?
Whatever's on your mind.

## What do you see here?
Mate in five.

## She went into town with Mrs. Lutz. Did they get him?
No.

## Feel like practicing?
Yeah. Just let me grab a shower.

## What are they, please?
\"Carefully\". \"Carefully\". \"Carefully\".

## Is this your first time here?
Yes.

## Because I love them, but they drive me crazy. You know how parents are?
No. I don't.

## Are you with the tournament?
Uh huh.

## Are you one of the players?
Yes.

## I've always wanted to learn how to play chess. I don't have the patience for it. When did you start playing?
When I was very young.

## If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion?
That's a very personal question.

## Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.

## Are we talking about me, or chess?
You.

## What are you looking for?
Nothing. I just came in for a steam.

## Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet?
I don't think I could.

## Does what's going on bother you at all? Or are you just wearing your game face?
I think it's interesting.

## Another kind of game?
In a way.

## How can you look at it so clinically?
Take your average cop. They deal with death everyday. If they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement.

## What about you? Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?
Of course.

## Do you?
Let's change the subject.

## Okay. So, tell me about yourself. Are you married?
I'm just curious.

## Are you going to tell me you didn't feel something in there?
You're projecting your own desires and reading more into what happened than what actually did.

## I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone? Let me ask you something? Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not?
Of course.

## Why?
Because I work with them.

## You're not?
No -- I'm not involved. And I plan on keeping it that way.

## Doesn't that scare you?
No.

## Why?
Because I think he's wrong.

## Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?
No. But I'm open to distractions.

## Wasn't I just talking about me?
No. You were talking about chess.

## I dunno. Where's Erica mother?
She died in a car accident.

## It must've been very hard on Erica?
It was.

## What?
Have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games.

## What is this?
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.

## What? By attacking me?
What are you talking about? You don't even know me.

## Does anyone?
I just don't want to fight with you.

## You can turn everything around so easily. This is not just another game, is it?
No.

## What do you want on it?
You.

## Would you settle for pepperoni?
If I have to. I'm going to take a shower.

## Did you call?
The line was busy. I'll try again.

## I thought you said the line was busy?
I tried again and got through.

## What's wrong?
Nothing.

## Peter, you have to admit--
Peter...

## For emphasis?
Exactly. It's the key.

## But what does he mean by a fierce magazine? Violent?
A fierce magazine... brutal... An angry magazine... A war magazine... a mercenary magazine... fierce... Mad.

## Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
Right. Here! c-4.

## Can I come in?
I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.

## This letter. I've never opened it.
Why?

## Why not?
Because I know what it says.

## How did you know it was \"carefully\"?
Frank told me.

## This isn't going to be like the phone book, is it?
Of course not.

## Are you going to come tonight?
Yeah. I'll be there later.

## Do we have a future?
I'm sure you are.

## You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?
I'm not nervous.

## Well, then this time you'll have to stay for the whole match, won't you?
I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.

## What?
We're almost married.

## About what?
I can't wait either.

## Have they harmed you?
No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me.

## Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.

## Where is the Fortress?
I don't know. It's a maze of tunnels. I can't see out.

## Does the Queen live?
The new Queen lives.

## Your powers are greater than you know. Have you ever seen one of these?
In the old books. It's called a glaive.

## Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
There is no other way.

## You have rope?
I am too old to climb down a rope.

## The Fortress moves?
Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.

## You choose these?
Yes. They will be more help than high-born barons.

## They know when they're going to die?
Everyone of his race is born knowing the day of his death.

## What do you see?
Darkness. Tunnels and corridors. Wait.

## Why?
I'm not sure.

## Lyssa? Why?
Like you, she has extraordinary powers. He would make her his Queen.

## Can she be forced?
I found the body of the Seer in the stream.

## What will happen?
They can be saddled.

## You have done it?
I road them often in my youth.

## It is today?
Yes. It is today.

## Am I not worth returning to?
Yes.

## Am I not beautiful enough to be loved?
Yes.

## Even by you?
Yes.

## You will not, then?
I cannot.

## It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death. Where is this place?
A forest near the Valley of Needles.

## What business?
Staying alive.

## Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us?
Fame.

## How did you know I had sons?
Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.

## And where do you lead, boy?
To the place where Death lives.

## When did you last sleep, boy?
I'm all right.

## Not sleepy, either?
No.

## What kind of friend do you think I am?
The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it.

## Well, it is true that if I received a royal command I couldn't very well disobey it, could I?
Go. I command you.

## Would you settle for a boar?
I am Quell.

## What is that awful looking place?
The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.

## Where are you going?
We'll meet you at the inn.

## Can't I come, too?
No.

## Quell?
I cannot go with you, my friend.

## Bread is for peasants, and wine makes me sneeze. Got any gumdrops?
No.

## Sugarballs?
No.

## You do?
You can have half.

## One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
I only want one.

## A foolish wish. And you, Quell?
Sir Ergo? ... My honorable Lord Ergo? ...

## What? Now you poke me in the nose as well?
I don't think it's working.

## And do you think I'm not going to eat myself to death this very night? Huh?
Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so ugly.

## Would you desert your friends?
No, no. I'm with you, boy.

## And do you think I live on air?
We have plenty of hares.

## I am being exploited! Where are you going?
I must take the old man to see some sick children. Kegan will guard you.

## And who is he?
He is the King.

## What news from our friends?
Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.

## Freylag's stronghold?
It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.

## You were attacked in the forest?
Yes. We lost five.

## How many did you lose?
Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.

## Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
The new King.

## With an old voice?
You know the voice.

## Can you see?
Yes. It is the Western Ocean.

## The leader of the Dark Ones?
Yes. Like you, a King. A King of many worlds. All enslaved.

## The Widow of the Web?
Yes.

## She bore you many children?
Yes.

## Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
Knowledge.

## Why must you know?
No.

## Why do you want to know?
He forgot his money... My mother's got a pub, behind the corner, and he forgot his money, about 100$.

## Yeah... How do you know it?
...I heard he said... That's all... Thanks.

## Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
Yeah, pal! And I didn't say anything, I said I don't know you. But do you know what did she say, that stupid Raphaella?

## Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.

## YEAH! I was sure! Come on, tell me! I know him?
No.

## Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
No... Not yet. He's very shy... and very sensitive.

## ...Good... But what's special in him?
...I don't know... It's true he touches me. I love him.

## ...You moved too, didn't you?
Yeah.

## Huh!? Because of the slaughter at your same floor?
...Not at all.

## At a certain moment I thought, maybe Leon would like working on his own? So he makes some little extras?
Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.

## Do you need money?
No... Just to know... Because it's a long time I work... And I never did anything with my money... I should do something.

## Pay attention to women, Leon. They are dangerous, you know?
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.

## Huh... 500 meters?
130... 140...

## What if you can't approach the car or he changes car?
Rocket launcher.

## Yeah... Come on, have a little training.
Oh really? But can you miss the car?

## Who'll I aim at?
OK.

## There, the guy... How did you do that, without even touching him? Without noise. It's like you put him away... How did you do it?
Five minutes. Keep in front of the window.

## Mathilda? May I come in?
Yes.

## May I go to the cinema?
No.

## Why?
Too heavy.

## Well... Then may you rent me your gear for the day?
I never rent my gear.

## And... May I kiss you, like in the movies, may this be an exception?
...I'm going to kiss you.

## What?
When I say I love you.

## Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
...17.

## What shall we do?
I think.

## ...Why didn't he close the window?
It's cool departing this way... warm... music...

## You're darkening the picture, aren't you?
A little...

## Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
There are just two things I'm interested in, love and death. For the moment, I have none of the two!

## Poor darling, and then?
Well... I proposed them to play roulette... Like we played... ...And I lost.

## ...Don't you drink?
I prefer waiting for a while... I feel it would go the wrong way.

## How many girlfriends did you have?
...I don't know.

## Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.

## You... You knock the code, when you come back, OK?
Yes.

## May I ask you a personal question?
...Yes.

## What do you do, with the money you earn?
Nothing, for the moment.

## Yeah, what?
I don't know... Getting far away, the two of us, for example... And forgetting all this...

## It will take them five minutes! How long ago did they arrive?
I don't know... Five minutes.

## It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch.
How shall we get out now, Leon?

## ...Yes?
Excuse me, Mister... I'm looking for Mister Rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and I got lost...

## How are you, Miss?
Fine...

## Yeah, true. But what does your father exactly do for living?
...Composer.

## Huh?
...No... he's my lover...

## Huh? Why?
Because you have to pay. It's like a parking meter, if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...

## ...And how much is it?
Ten dollars... A month.

## Can I sit on the stairways now?
Huh... Yeah, yeah... Of course.

## Rinaldi... Rinaldi... What region do you come from?
Messina.

## But... He works for your same employer?
Yeah, but I don't give a shit about. I trade at left, at right and that's dangerous in there...

## ...Who sent you?
Giancarlo... Rinaldi.

## Is he still alive?
Yeah... And still in Messina. He's my uncle.

## Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
No... Dino's.

## Have you ever been in Messina, son?
Yes... Twice.

## Did you fish in Messina? The \"pesce spada\"?
No...

## Do you recognize him?
...Even his mother wouldn't.

## May we have this wolf's name and address?
These guys have no place. They change virtually everyday. And his name... It's a surname.

## Where?
For a walk. I don't know.

## What is it?
Adelle... Maurice is in the paper.

## Why am I such an authority?
Here comes the resume.

## Uncle Maurice, you're wearing sneakers?
High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with heel support and air-cushioned soles. They're nasty.

## And your store? What about your new store? What about all your dreams?
I have new dreams now.

## She was being symbolic. What if she asked you to fly to the moon?
You'd be visiting me at Nasa.

## What if you don't make it?
I'll make it.

## Are you two planning kids?
Maybe later.

## How serious is it?
Then it'll have to wait until I finish.

## What?
I finish the walk, and then we may take all the chances we want.

## What would you like us to do?
Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.

## How long does this... Mania last?
A couple days to a few months if untreated.

## Are you a preacher?
No, I just don't want anybody dying because I didn't say something when I had the chance.

## A wife?... Did someone piss drunk run into your wife? Crushed her like a bug. Snapped her bones?
That's enough.

## Can it kill me?
It can, but it'll have to wait in line.

## What steps do we take now?
We operate. We find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding... I just did this procedure on a Senator and he's doing fine.

## What are the odds? Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?
It's hard to say. It's a delicate surgery. There's no getting around the fact that it's a very high-risk situation.

## Pardon?
I mean why the sudden voluntary visit -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...

## Routine, I assure you. I just wanted to gage my health. Am I healthy?
Yes -- you are.

## You do?
I've seen it before.

## You have?
Okay.

## Just for curiosity sake that's all?
Twenty miles? I see.

## Yes?
The flowers... they're beautiful.

## You thought I sent them?
There was no card.

## Have I forgotten something? Is this a special day?
It's just a regular day.

## The new store?
Honey, I told you. If it makes you happy, we should just do it.

## Is this going to be similar to the flower incident?
Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.

## I want to be shown... Maurice would you do anything for me?
Yes.

## Anything?
No I don't. I don't even know if you'd walk across the street for me.

## Why do you polish it?
A Book Society Award is a very prestigious thing.

## Why are you polishing it -- in bed -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at night? Are you going to show it to someone?
No.

## Then why?
There's no reason.

## You like to take walks?
No. But I want to take a walk with you.

## You've just decided, is that right?
Yes.

## Your father?
He's plastered.

## Did you have a dream?
I know where my heaven is.

## Where?
Pacifica, California.

## Maurice?
Yes.

## If I die, you'll know where to look for me?
Go to sleep Ellen.

## No really, if God takes us away from each other, you know where to look now?
The beach of Pacifica, California.

## What did they ask?
If I had seen you. By the way I'm sorry about your wife. They told me.

## To where?
Pacifica, California.

## From where?
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

## Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
Most certainly.

## Doubts? About what?
About my love for her.

## What's his story?
His name is Maurice. He's dancing around everything else.

## Maurice and Ellen Parker... it was issued in Philly... Mr. Maurice Parker has come a long way from home. Why?
Hansen's whipped. Has to call his wife every two hours or she'll go ballistic when he gets home.

## I'm Isaac... I'm three.
That's all right isn't it?

## I'm Maurice Parker... I'm much older than three. Are your parents home?
You know what, I can play baseball with my brothers when I'm bigger.

## Is that right?
You know what... I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon.

## You tell stories?
Oh no... I'm not good at that. Very bad in fact...

## Who's telling this story?
That's me.

## Perhaps there's another route?
Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat.

## This story is big huh?
Mammoth.

## Umm, Coalville Utah.
The Gazette's small huh?

## Umm, he's going to make it isn't he?
Maybe.

## What happened?
Never have children. If they're not a burden to you, they're a burden to someone else.

## Are you firing me?
No. No... I won't be here for a while. The store will be closed in the interim.

## You going on a trip Mr. Parker?
Yes.

## Where?
California.

## When are you leaving?
Tomorrow.

## Walking where?
California.

## Phileas Fogg?
... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris.

## You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
I told you.

## You're walking to California?
Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.

## I'm really lost. What does this have to do with walking?
I said, 'I would do anything for her'... and she didn't believe me. I said, 'I'd walk across the country for her'... she didn't believe me.

## Why know?
Because I should have shown her before... Everyday, I should have shown her.

## What Mr. Parker?
She never ate a slice.

## Tom Joad?
... The Grapes of Wrath.

## Are they standing?
Saluting.

## What, come on?
I can't do it. I want you to finish, but I want you to live more.

## Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then?
Don't do this.

## Where am I?
In a hospital.

## What do your friends call you?
Steph.

## Do you have a car, Steph?
You're in pain.

## You ever lose somebody Stephanie?
Mr. Parker, I'm supposed to give you your fish sticks.

## Did you tell him everything you wanted to? Did you do everything you could while he was here?
You're going to have a lot of work to do when I get back.

## Is it a boy or a girl?
Oh, that's not mine.

## You look so happy -- how long have you been married?
Forty-seven years.

## Where did he go?
He's getting my sweater from the car. I said there was a breeze. I told him not to go.

## May I ask you a question that might sound strange?
Yes.

## How are you feeling?
Confused. I'm not sure what to do now. I'm not sure what he wants for me.

## What do you mean?
I mean you've done a great thing. You should be rewarded monetarily.

## What? Who are you?
If that ain't fate?... Hi, I'm Dave Caldwell. I do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down here.

## Evening News?
We did a piece after your story ran in the New York Times.

## What are my choices?
Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.

## Non-alcoholic malt beverage?
...Noooo.

## Orange soda?
No.

## Coffee?
No.

## Sparkling apple cider?
No.

## Water?
One drink minimum per show. Everything's ten dollars. Now... tell me what you want or I'll eighty- six you.

## Are you working?
Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.

## That's funny. I wonder if you'll take two hundred and fifty dollars to fuck me?
That is, if you'll come to my room for an hour, I will give you five hundred dollars.

## Sarah -- with an H?
No -- S.E.R.A.

## You what?
I sometimes fade out.

## Mind if I use the bathroom?
Of course.

## Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
OK... whatever.

## What's the story? Are you too drunk to come?
No, I came here to drink... myself... you know...

## To death?
Yes, that's right.

## How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
I think about four weeks, and I've got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day.

## Yes... that should do it. What am I? A luxury?
Yeah. And your meter just ran out.

## No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
I sold it this morning. I'm going to take cabs from now on in.

## What's up?
I was looking for you tonight. I don't know if you have a boyfriend...

## You do?
This is the home of an angel.

## You OK out there?
Yes. Take your time. I'm fine.

## You OK?
Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.

## Thank you. What time is it?
Don't know. My watch went the way of the car.

## Is that really what you want to ask me?
Yes.

## First. It's our first. I'm just concerned. So... why are you killing yourself?
Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.

## What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.

## I'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better. Let's talk about tomorrow. Wanna do something?
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.

## Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.

## So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
What do you mean?

## Don't be silly?
Sera... what you don't understand is...

## You can never... never... ask me to stop drinking. Do you understand?
Hi!

## Want a drink? Great nap. Wanna go out tonight?
Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.

## Ben?
Sorry.

## Sera, I love that name... S.E.R.A. Before we proceed onwards, there is something I need to say. OK?
OK.

## Because... it's better for me that way. OK?
Well... OK...

## No?
I know that...

## Right... the suitcase was clinking. So what did you do with your clothes?
I'm going to fill it right now.

## When?
Tomorrow night as a matter of fact.

## That's impressive. How did you do that?
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.

## We?
I warned you... ...but I'm sorry.

## That's amazing. What are you? Some sort of angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies? How can you be so good?
Why don't you go back to sleep. I'll go out and buy us some breakfast.

## Can we just forget it?
I don't understand any of that.

## Thank you, Sera.
Can we just ignore it?

## Do you want me not to go tonight?
No... we already talked about that.

## Shall we go away for a couple of days?
Yeah... I'd like that.

## Fifth and Mayflower. You know it?
Yes. One of my friends was there. I wonder if you ever clipped her.

## I've missed the best sun. Why did you have to pawn your watch?
I didn't know I'd ever need it again.

## Will you lighten up, please?
One thing... one thing... this is one thing you can do for me. I've given you gallons of free will here! You can do this for me.

## You know I love you... yeah?
Yes.

## Hey, Brad... how's it going?
Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.

## How'd this happen?
I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.

## How much, do you think?
I don't know. I'll find out though.

## Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the convention?
Do I look that obvious? My name's Paul.

## So... are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous?
Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.

## Right here at the hotel. Why?
Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.

## You have been lonely?
I've been all right.

## You have been lonely?
I am lonely, Yuri.

## Where have you been staying?
With an old friend.

## Where have you been?
It was a slow night. I went to a hotel for a few drinks.

## A full night on the street and this is all?
Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score.

## Yes? What?
It's me, Yuri.

## Have you told anyone that I'm here?
No.

## Harvard Law School?
That's right.

## Yes, but your major is Fashion Merchandising. Harvard won't be impressed that you aced \"History of Lycra\". What are your backups?
I don't need backups. Harvard is the school I'm going to.

## What alibi?
I can't tell you.

## You understand you're on trial for murder?
Where they saw you standing over the body covered in his blood.

## Why would I kill my husband?
Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.

## Were you with another man?
Go to hell.

## Are we done for today?
I believe we are.

## What?
You're fired. I have new representation.

## Is he always such an ass?
He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.

## But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
He's an ass that's gonna try.

## He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
That's not what's important.

## You took my class in LA. You had the best high kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?
Sort of.

## Who could better understand than me?
I have made my fortune on my ability to teach women how to perfect their bodies with the Brooke's Butt Buster workout.

## What's going on?
Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.

## Did she have a weapon in her hand?
No.

## Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.

## Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
His dead body with a bullet in it.

## Okay -- Ms. Windham, when you uh arrived back at the house? Was your father there?
Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.

## And when you came downstairs, what happened?
I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.

## But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
No, she'd stashed it by then.

## Did you hear a shot fired?
No. I was in the shower.

## So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
I guess.

## Miss Windham, can you tell us what you'd been doing earlier in the day?
I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.

## Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a perm before, Miss Windham?
Yes.

## How many, would you say?
Two a year since I was twelve. You do the math.

## Chutney, why is it that Tracy Marcinko's curls were ruined when she got hosed down?
Because they got wet.

## Who's askin'?
I'm Elle Woods. Ms. Bonafante's attorney.

## Huh?
Tell him, Paulette.

## Did you get it?
Yes. But I can't tell you what it is.

## What are you talking about?
He's gay -- he isn't Brooke's lover! He's making it up. Whoever killed Heyworth is paying him off.

## Is everything okay?
You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened.

## You're hitting on me?
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.

## What did you see when you entered the house?
I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body of Mr. Windham.

## Was she carrying a weapon?
No, she was crying her eyes out.

## Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof that you and Mrs. Windham were having an affair?
Just the love in my heart.

## What's going on?
Donovan's firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he's taking on first year interns.

## Uh -- both?
Forget it. I've already spent too many hours crying over you.

## Yes?
Aristotle.

## Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
I don't know.

## After you went to all that trouble?
She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.

## Is she?
She could use some mascara and some serious highlights, but she's not completely unfortunate-looking.

## You showed up Warner in class? You're supposed to be showing up Sarah.
Could I be anymore goddamn spastic? So you're sure, this Warner guy is \"the one\"?

## You ready?
No.

## So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?
No. Sometimes I say \"Okay\" instead of \"Fine\".

## Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?
Of course I can believe it. You're going to make a great lawyer.

## Licensed attorney or family member?
Uh -- family.

## Relation?
I'm her sister.

## Name?
Delta. Gamma.

## You know her?
Our group is full.

## Oh, God, was this like an RSVP thing?
The idiot speaks.

## Really?
He's already got his coffee -- maybe he needs a donut.

## What?
Maybe you should sleep with the judge too. Then we can win the case.

## Why else would she have flown in from Newport? It's not like she'd Fed Ex a six carat diamond.
Can someone please tell Rick that he is not the only Sigma Chi with a big penis?

## Too demure?
I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.

## What if -- you know -- it's not the night?
Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy? You've been dating for a year -- it's not like he's trying to impress you.

## Here. You're gonna need this.
So?

## Your scrunchie?
My lucky scrunchie. It helped me pass Spanish.

## Not yet.
Elle, do you know what happened on \"Days of Our Lives\" yesterday?

## Do they just -- put you on the spot like that? Like, all the time?
The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.

## And if you don't know the answer, they just kick you out?
You have Stromwell.

## Did she do that to you, too?
Neat.

## Don't worry. It gets better. Who else do you have?
My money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.

## Why?
She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...

## How do you figure?
Because people aren't always what they seem to be and you refuse to see that. Have a little faith. You might be surprised.

## Damn. We can't see her for an hour?
No, she can't move for an hour.

## How can you still believe she's innocent?
You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing.

## Okay, how would it work?
I can't.

## Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
That's not really a topic that keeps me up at night -- but maybe it should.

## What the hell is that for?
The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.

## You really think I'm attractive?
Gay men know designers. Straight men don't.

## Whoa -- Why?
As long as you realize I'm not just some man-toy you can show off like a trophy.

## So Friday at eight?
Someone missed you.

## Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good.
Is he the only one?

## What happened?
I don't know! I don't know anything any more! I just need to be by myself.

## You guys -- I can't. We're in the middle of a trial.
Are you sure?

## Where's Warner?
I wish we could stay longer, but I have a game.

## Why not?
I'd rather have a client who's innocent.

## Yes? Ms. Woods?
I changed my mind. I'd pick the dangerous one.

## You should. Do you have a resume?
I do.

## Class schedule, map, book list.
You don't really believe she's innocent?

## Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
Uh, no. Maybe you should try the Lido deck.

## Your what?
You know -- mixers, formals, beach trips.

## There's a pizza welcome lunch in twenty minutes. Does that count?
I guess it'll have to...

## Elle, believe me, I never expected to be doing this, but I think it's the right thing to do.
You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde?

## How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.

## What're you talking about? You're not here to see me?
No, silly. I go here.

## You go where?
Harvard. Law school.

## Oops! Time for class. Meet me after? On the benches?
Uh -- sure.

## So -- uh -- how was your first class?
Good. Good.

## Do anything exciting?
I'm sorry, I just hallucinated.

## Thank you. Having fun?
Now I am.

## See?
Thanks for the backup.

## How was I supposed to know what kind of shoes you had on?
It made me realize something. I'm an idiot.

## Really?
In court. On opposing sides.

## Are you serious?
Huh. Imagine that. Looks like I am.

## Did you ever take Mrs. Windham on a date?
Yes.

## Where?
A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would recognize us.

## And how long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham?
Three months.

## And what is your boyfriend's name?
Chuck.

## VANDERMARK But I guess it wasn't enough for Brooke.
Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. Do you have any reason to believe it did?

## Oh, God. What if Josh doesn't think I'm serious enough?
Faith.

## Then we smash 'em?
Anything left for smashing you may happily smash.

## You go? Not watch fun?
I have something far more pleasant awaiting me.

## Fire moat... why do that?
Purely a precaution...

## What?
Delusion... a kind of magic which works against the magician.

## Indeed, the best of fun... Enjoy yourselves.
We go out, smash 'em now?

## More fun win battle?
This is another victory, my friends. What began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress.

## You go to lady now?
To finish last evening's delightful work.

## What do you want with me?
Your love.

## And you... are you not also afraid?
I am afraid of nothing.

## Protection?
Like some vile toadstool.

## Do you feed on mice and rats?
I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.

## Why have you brought me here?
To be my bride, of course.

## Your moans seem almost pleasurable, my dear... developing a taste for the lash?
Kill me... I want... so nice...

## What do you want from me?
At the moment, very little. Your company at my table...

## We'll get you cleaned up, find a suitable gown... I imagine you'll enjoy a good meal?
Oh, yes...

## What will become of me then?
It's nothing. My men take great delight in routing the enemy. Don't trouble yourself, beauty.

## Might we watch, too?
Later, beloved... Now I wish only to be with you...

## Pleasure is for those who seize it! Do you think those insipid, pale- skinned mortals will ever know such rapture?
It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust. I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...

## And, now?
Now I want to live forever. I've never felt so strong or happy.

## You come stealee tleasoo?
Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.

## No need lie, boy. I no hurt you. Do I look like I wanna hurt you?
Well, er... no. I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of.

## Cathay?
Country fa' fa' away. To the East, beyond the lising sun...

## You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
Dlagon not like that. Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.

## Oh no... Don't you understand?
No, wait... please... listen...

## Who might these friends be?
Screwball you know, and many other of the wee folk. We serve as escort for our grand champion, Jack o' the Green.

## Gump, is it?
Aye, Honeythorn Gump, come to serenade you, Jack... come to make you dance.

## Faerie ring?
To be sure.

## And if I cannot?
Why, Jack, then tis your death song I'll be strumming.

## Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.

## What does she want from me?
Elderberry wine. No finer drink under heaven.

## He is afraid of enchantment! Will you listen to the fool prattle on.
Well... I... I don't want to be rude, but... it's generally known that --

## Why has this happened to the world? Why is it winter now, and dark?
Aye. Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer.

## Don't you know?
If you're looking for enchantment, Jack, that I can give thee...

## Then, what's gone wrong? Why did it happen?
If ye want more tricks, I'm your man, but for big questions ye must go elsewhere.

## Don't you care about what's happened?
There must be an answer somewhere.

## Will you lead me to her?
Aye. On the morrow we go, but tonight... ... tonight is for making merry.

## Are we here?
Aye. That foul wallow be where Jenny Greenteeth dwells. Oona... lure her out. Play the part of a girl-child.

## What do I do?
Don't get caught, that's what! She'll suck your bones like honey- comb.

## And if she thinks me a liar?
Fie on what she thinks! You mind her claws and teeth... Cast your spell, Oona.

## Bravely spoke. You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
Time for a champion. Can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird's nests, Jack?

## Twill take more than heart. Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
I know where to find it. Taking possession be another matter.

## Have we turned grave-robber, then?
A tomb it once was, boy, and a tomb it may yet be... There's another in residence at Lindfarne now.

## And who might that be?
No less a creature than the Lindfarne Worm.

## So I'm to be a dragon-slayer, is that it?
Knaves and robbers...

## What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles?
You'll know it when you see it... tis a splendid sight, all covered with gold... Don't fear making noise. Dragons be deaf as tree stumps.

## What is it?
Something's coming.

## Pregnant, is she?
It would appear so.

## I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...! Want to see me do it?
We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.

## How do you plan on finding this here castle, if ye don't mind me asking?
A true and troubling question, Gump... We'll start from where the unicorn was killed. The Baron must have left a trail.

## Aye. Said to follow it to the edge of night. But is this the right bird?
I'm sure. It spoke to me.

## Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say?
Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.

## Blackheart?
Aye. He's enchanted the lot of them. His reward for delivering the unicorn.

## What know you of fields of war?
There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing.

## Stealing his arms?
Oona tells me the raven has roosted for the night on a sharp stone spire some half a mile distance.

## And this? Some of their handiwork?
Nay. That's but to distract the casual visitor. A dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly.

## What make ye of that, Jack?
It bodes evil.

## Is she... dead?
No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.

## We're blind now. Oona was our eyes and ears. How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her?
We'll find it.

## No... but what choice have we?
Never felt so cold in all me born days...

## Why not mine the damned walls?
We do both. Our frontal attack a diversion whilst we drive a tunnel under...

## A fine mess this is... horrid, nipping creatures... What do we now, Jack?
Defend ourselves. We've bested far worse already.

## Faerie magic's no match for a sorcerer's power... We have Ogg's gifts, the key and the --
What magic have we on our side?

## Will you chance a miss?
Aye. Before the wee pesties attacked.

## Can you save her?
Easily... The question is, can we save ourselves? Be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war.

## In the dark, lad? Why should he do that?
Because sunlight will kill him. Quickly now, give me the key.

## Mean you to seek him out below?
I'm not afraid of the dark.

## Did you bring me here to sup?
Nay, lad, we're here to collect a weapon you'll need fighting the Baron.

## What weapon?
Sunlight.

## Plan on carrying some away in a kettle?
Easier than that, Jack. Screwball! Fetch me down a couple of them plates.

## Will you explain what's going on?
Patience, lad.

## She lives... isn't that worth singing about?
She lives like all the world before the Baron's curse lifted. Now the world's reborn, yet still she sleeps...

## The quest's at an end and where's the good of it? A faerie festival over a pile of bones?
I was with the Princess.

## Where?
By the pond. She was teasing me.

## And did you?
Nay. It was lost. When I came up for air the pond was frozen over.

## How're these?
They'll do nicely.

## These for me?
If you like.

## Unicorn?
A promise is a sacred oath.

## Only were he a fool to boot. See yon viper?
I detest serpents.

## What shall we do?
Be patient.

## What's the matter?
I've lost my napkin. It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.

## Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one? It would thrill me so.
How much longer?

## Tis a fair question. If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.
Are you honest?

## He'll not flee if I show myself?
Not if you be chaste. Tis an awesome test of virginity.

## Where are you going?
To fetch your napkin.

## What happened?
I don't know. They've hurt the unicorn.

## Who?
My father and the Baron.

## How bad was the unicorn's wound?
It happened so fast. He was hurt and ran away.

## He did run?
Oh, yes, and the mare with him.

## Do you think memory can be washed away like a few spots of blood?
Not even the birds sing sweet as you.

## If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...? Do you wish to marry me, Jack?
My lady mocks me.

## Let it. Haven't you a cozy bower we might hide in?
Tis not fit for a princess.

## Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
I have no wife.

## Jack... Forgive me...
Do you wish it, Jack? Wish you this our wedding band?

## What have I done?
Only what's right...

## What?
Sunlight... It destroys him.

## Sunlight?
That's why he goes masked during the day...

## Is what you said about the ring but another dream?
Oh no, dearest Jack... I meant every word.

## What's the matter?
Ouch! Something's biting me.

## Oona? Do you suppose it's a faerie?
Ow! Whatever it is, it hurts.

## Grand champion, is it? And what great cause leads you to me?
We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir. He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.

## What's this now?
I bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty.

## Well spoke, boy. You have discerning taste for one so young... Just who might you be?
They call me Green Jack, ma'am.

## Think me fair, do you, Jack?
The moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you...

## Where do I find the Baron's castle?
Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night...

## What became of the princess?
Princess? I know of no princess.

## Is she fair, this princess?
Exceeding fair.

## As fair as me?
Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.

## You'll visit again?
As a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom.

## I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk. Mayn't I come visit sometime?
I'd be honored.

## Only that?
And charmed, of course.

## Do I not please you, Jack?
In every way.

## And am I not fair?
Wondrously so.

## Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth?
That was in jest.

## How so?
Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag.

## And sweet?
True north... Straight up that pass, through the net.

## What do we do now?
We wait.

## What's she doing?
I think she's about to foal.

## Come on, Gump, let's have a look at this witchcraft.
Where?

## What can you steal from a man already lost his life?
His honor, I suppose... seeing he no longer can defend it.

## What care the bones when the soul is free?
Bah! You faeries have the morals of ferrets.

## Done like a champion. Can you reach me with the line?
Sorry, Jack.

## No speeches! What's a little swim after sticking worms and ogres?
Oh, but I have.

## How came you by this blade?
I slew the Lindfarne Worm with it.

## Sigurd the Volsung slew Fafnir with that blade... See the line where Regin welded the break?
Yes, yes... Jimmy Squarefoot good friend to one and all...

## Lost?
Much good we do the world, for all our noble quest...

## Simple as that, eh?
Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate...

## To Castle Couer de Noir?
There'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there. Once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry.

## You've been inside?
I guess it depends on what you give up on.

## When does George get to come see his house?
It's so beautiful.

## What's that for?
Mom said I should.

## What color?
Red.

## What's wrong?
I couldn't get it to go down.

## And why was the alarm on?
I couldn't sleep last night.

## Why? What do you mean?
Uh...using Josh like that.

## Has he eaten anything at all?
I'd be more comfortable if he slept in the guestroom.

## Who are all these people?
Sorry I got you into trouble.

## Are you his friend?
No.

## Why?
Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into guys. I hate nose rings. And the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working.

## Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?
I'm living here while I build another house.

## Don't you have school?
Nope.

## What's today?
Monday.

## What's that?
I had them in my pocket.

## Can you keep Sam straight?
He's not gay. I found out purely by accident, believe me.

## I mean drugs. I thought you said he was?
He wouldn't use around me. I don't like any of it.

## Maybe your tongue...I don't know, my mouth is numb. Why did you do that?
My mother would die.

## What did you think it would be?
I don't know... More like when I kissed Sam.

## I'm hungry! Where's my dinner? Who ate my dinner? Huh? Who's in trouble now?
Hi.

## What are you doing here?
They're trying to make me spend the summer here. I'm leaving in the morning.

## Where to?
I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.

## Your dad's really gonna build his house?
I don't know.

## Where's your dad?
He jumped into the ocean.

## Do you remember me from when you lived here?
Yeah.

## Really?
I wanted him to marry her.

## Why?
Turn over.

## Josh and I are going to South Coast. Wanna ride? Maybe see a movie?
No thanks.

## Huh?
I can use your mom's.

## Not really. No. Kinda. He got busted?
His parents took his car. They're making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer.

## Really?
He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.

## Why are you so uptight?
I don't even...what do you mean? I don't even know what that means.

## Does everything have to have a point?
It's freakish. I don't get it. I'm not really supposed to touch you, but I can look.

## What are you talking about?
Josh said...

## You're driving me crazy! Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
Not really.

## Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?
Okay. I guess.

## Are you afraid of heights?
Hey, I can get you three hundred cash for two hours.

## What?
You hate your father.

## What?
You're so nice to let Sam use your shower.

## Why is that?
Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.

## Will he talk to me?
No.

## Are you guys' friends?
We've known each other since grade school.

## I mean, but did you both go camping on weekends? Listen to music? Masturbate together? Talk on the phone?
I wouldn't want you as a friend.

## Mr. Stevens?
I've been dreading you.

## A violation?
Oh, yes.

## And if I enclosed it?
An exhaust system or a window is code.

## A sink?
Allowed outside the enclosed area.

## I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?
If that's what it takes.

## how much weight have you lost?
Oh...nothing. Thirty pounds. I just haven't been very hungry.

## How's your wife?
When we divorce a decade ago, she was very, very angry. Now she's just hostile.

## Right...she married...what was he?
He buys and sells the world.

## Well, that's sort of...you're sure you're not hungry?
This isn't me. We can show clients endless options, change anything in a matter of hours on the computer. But you won't change.

## Maybe...?
That's too long.

## How old are you?
Forty.

## We were probably in school together. You went to Berkley?
Class of eighty-six! I didn't know you were there.

## What can I do for you, George?
Thank you.

## Is Alyssa home?
She's out with a friend.

## Oh...do you know when she'll be home?
She didn't really say.

## Sam?
Uh huh.

## It's midnight. What's the matter, Sam?
Nothing. My dad's dying. I really need to talk to Alyssa.

## Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter?
There are no windows facing my...exposure.

## Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime.
And you thought they might be under her dress?

## To check up on me?
I'll be around to check up on you.

## Why would you be there?
Because I live there.

## Do you ever get like the slightest inkling that you might want to help me instead of doing absolutely nothing?
No.

## Why?
It bugs me.

## You snore at night. That bugs me. Can I take you out?
Your brothers are right. It was the most god-awful smell I've ever had my nose around.

## Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom?
I don't know.

## When are you going to be back?
I don't know.

## Where is it?
A friend of yours is here.

## Did you got through my pants?
I might have a solution.

## I know. Why?
I like how it feels not to feel.

## What would you like to be?
What I'm not.

## What are you now?
Nothing.

## What do you know about me?
He's got nothing to do with me.

## What would you be doing now?
Getting high, I guess.

## If I asked you to stop, would you?
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.

## Sun glasses?
To hide a black eye.

## Why wouldn't she leave?
I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.

## Do you ever wish you had done it?
I loved him too much.

## After everything he did to you and your mom?
After everything.

## Dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for Christmas lights with a switch inside?
Absolutely. Have him put it on a separate line. At Christmas, we'll pact it so full of lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses.

## I don't know what that means. What kind of problem?
The kind where there isn't really an answer.

## I don't know what that means. What kind of problem?
The kind where there isn't really an answer.

## And you told Mom today?
Yes.

## What would you do?
I'd build a house.

## Can you build a house in four months?
I can die trying.

## I haven't forced him to work. I only wet him down once. Why would he leave?
It's my day off. I thought I'd help with the plumbing.

## Why do you let your dog crap on his lawn, day after day?
I don't let him. He just loves to.

## How many bedrooms will your house have?
Three.

## I just wanted to know where Mom was?
Oh. Sorry.

## Because Dad left?
She's a little sad, is all.

## You let him pierce his nose?
Lock the door behind you.

## Where is he?
Where he always is.

## What are you doing?
He doesn't answer.

## You're the most beautiful woman I have ever known in my life.
Why does he have a lock on his door?

## What?
I'm not talking just physically. Even your anger is perfect.

## What did you do with your dog?
Kurt's been feeding him.

## But you can't call me while you think?
I wasn't thinking. Look, I'm sorry I didn't think to call you while I thought...I think.

## Why would they tow your truck?
I was parked in day parking.

## Why call me?
I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.

## Money?
Severance pay. And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.

## Where will you live?
The garage.

## When's school over?
Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.

## You and Sam are going to live in a garage without plumbing for the summer?
The garage is plumbed. I'll put in a toilet. We'll survive.

## Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
No. I was going to let you do that.

## What?
I used to live here.

## Which?
The first and the last.

## I don't even like turkey sandwiches. What kind of pizza?
Sam's favorite.

## Do you remember?
The only time I can think of for sure, I was holding onto Sam in the ocean, saving him from the waves.

## What is it?
I'm fine. Nothing. I'll drop by your lunch tomorrow.

## Finished or unfinished?
It was perfect, George. Amazing. It was so real.

## Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
That wasn't a dream. That was Sam.

## With your hands or your tongue?
You're not well.

## Where's Sam?
He won't use my shower. I don't get it.

## You brought your kids?
I'll find something that won't kill them.

## Do you need help?
I think so.

## I can hire workers to help me.
How much time do they get to spend with their dad?

## Going on?
When I picked you up from the train station...what you said.

## That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known. What was that?
That was the truth.

## Let's not do this, okay?
I need to know.

## Is your back still killing you?
I didn't think you'd come today.

## Back. Neck. Back.
Left you?

## What?
I could die.

## Are you going to kiss me?
It's not my back that's killing me.

## Been thinking?
No.

## Does Alyssa know?
Nothing.

## What's your deal with Alyssa?
Don't even...I'm there.

## What the fuck?
Everything happens for a reason. That's what my dad said.

## Then you tell me, what just happened?
The payoff.

## Should I?
It would worry me.

## What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
I'd be you.

## To shave your chest?
We should take a vacation.

## Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?
I'd love to drive through New England in the Fall.

## What?
I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks. Sam's working. I told you Sam was working. I mean, he really is.

## You can't go with me because of Sam?
Sam is working at something for the first time in his life. Once in a while he even talks to me. I want to be around for that.

## So am I, Robin. I'm working at something, too. I'm even talking. Do you want to be around for it?
I was talking about our marriage.

## What are you doing home?
I always felt I could never marry you without first showing you what a fabulous life you cloud live despite me.

## Where are the kids?
Sam took them to a movie.

## Are you wearing eye shadow?
You don't look like you.

## Do you like red?
Hey.

## You got a dog?
It's not ours. It's George's.

## Do you know anything about building a house?
No.

## What are you doing in my room?
I didn't go in your room.

## Can you stay for dinner?
Depends on what I'd give up on.

## You're sure about this?
Yeah.

## You could keep it and rent it out?
This is what he wants.

## Why?
He'll be gone for his birthday.

## What did you say?
Dad said it first.

## Why do we have to get up and eat with you this early?
I just thought it would be nice.

## All day again?
Not all day. I'll be home after lunch.

## Can we really help build a house?
I brought a few of my own.

## Go tell your father we're eating.
Nothing R, okay?

## Dad's home, already?
In the bedroom.

## Nagger?
No, nigger.

## A night in the hole?
Better make it a week.

## Is Mae Rose okay?
She's doing just fine.

## And the baby?
He's a big one.

## Biscuit, when you're done with Jangle Leg, you think you could squeeze me in?
Thought you'd never ask. Biscuit needs some gravy.

## You can try, but you won't get too far. Why you interested?
Crawford's are always looking for new talent.

## Yo, Blocker, what's going on here?
Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.

## I did, Claude. I mentioned you. I mentioned you both. But the fact is, pardons don't come cheap. The kid can hit. What can you do?
Look, I am truly sorry about this. I'd like to help you...

## At least the kid's getting out. Isn't this what you wanted?
Oh, no, Ray. Not tonight. Spanky's not happy with you.

## Is Spanky here?
No, but...

## Then what's the problem?
Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.

## Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
Sharp.

## She's alright, isn't she?
Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.

## Why not?
She got married last month.

## Married?
Real nice guy, too. Trumpet player. They moved down to New Orleans.

## Take care of me?
You know, go to the tonk or whatever.

## Want me to come back some other time?
Nice girl like you don't belong in a place like this. But if you talk to Sylvia, tell her old Claude said congratulations.

## You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there.

## Half the men in this prison swear they're innocent. Don't you think that's kinda funny?
You have to forgive me if I don't laugh.

## Claude, mind helping me to the bathroom?
As a pair of fur-lined bedroom slippers, boss.

## Season tickets to the Yankees. Right there on the first base line. What's wrong, baby?
Sure it is. I just don't see any reason to rush into things. Damn, look at this shirt. I'll be right back.

## Did you go see my cousin Maynard like I asked you in my letter?
Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.

## Can't you remember your own name?
I know it begins with a \"C\"...

## You're cute. You have any money, Claude?
Ten dollars. But I need it to get home.

## Don't I know you?
I don't think so.

## Sure I do. What's your name again?
Claude Banks. How could I forget that? You've got to remember me. Ray Gibson. We went to high school together.

## You went to Monroe?
That's right! Good old Monroe...

## Where they taking us, anyway?
Probably to Spanky's headquarters down at the pier.

## What are they gonna do to us?
You? Dine and ditch, right? Over ten bucks? You're probably looking at a thumb.

## A thumb? What do you mean, like cut it off? For ten bucks? That include the tip?
Come on, daddy-o. You haven't said a word since we started. Least you could do is make some friendly conversation.

## Start your job? What kind of job?
That's some long green.

## What?
Nothing.

## Why didn't you take it?
The Negro League don't pay so good. And you're always on the road. That don't wash with Daisy.

## A loan officer?
That's right, a loan officer.

## So you mean, if I needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running, I'd have to hype some square like you?
Uh-huh.

## How would I get a loan, anyway?
You need collateral.

## That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
My daddy gave me this watch.

## Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
Looks like a fake to me. Loan denied!

## You mean this sign? The one that says \"No Coloreds Allowed.\" That's a good question. Ray, how come we missed the sign?
Look, ma'am, we've been driving all day. We'd just like to purchase one of those pies and we'll be on our way.

## What'd you say?
I said you're soft.

## Alright. You want some pie?
Yeah, I want some pie.

## Don't get all agitated on me. I bought a bottle of rum from a couple of dudes, I heard 'em talking...
Nice meeting you? You've been here before, haven't you?

## Reward?
Hey, Ray. I've been looking for you.

## Still got that ten dollars?
Well, not exactly. See, I met this girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing girl. Her name's Sylvia.

## That jelly you were talking to right here?
So you made a generous contribution.

## What are you talking about?
While you were upstairs doing God's work, I was getting jack-legged by a fool with four threes.

## You lost all our money in a card game?
He even got my daddy's watch.

## Fuck that cheap-ass watch -- I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money?
It ain't here.

## I wouldn't do that if I was you.
What ain't there?

## Why do you think they call him Jangle Leg?
Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year.

## So?
He does it all by himself.

## What about you, Radio?
Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.

## He just blocked it out. Nigger's crazy. He's the one who did all the stabbing. He's capable of some heinous shit. How 'bout him down there?
No, man. I want you to have it.

## So?
You know what I'm saying.

## What does that mean?
Forget it.

## What's up, Ray?
Claude.

## What do I want? What makes you think I want something?
Yeah.

## The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places.

## What'd you say?
Absolutely. The map is very clear.

## You call this a map? What was Cookie smoking when he drew this?
Cookie didn't draw it. I did.

## Say what?
That's right, we'll get off at the next stop. The train's pulling into the station right now.

## The hell you talking about? What train?
We're in the Bronx, my man. Hundred and Sixty First Street.

## I don't know. Who do you want?
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.

## You get ketchup?
Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want.

## What am I gonna eat?
You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start.

## You want to hit? Yo, Claude. Give Can't Get Right a shot.
Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?

## Him?
Can't be worse than any of these other fools.

## So, Blocker, what do you think of our boy?
What about us? Don't forget to mention us.

## Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now.

## You and Wilkins sure are getting chummy. You two planning on going steady, or something?
He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.

## Hey, I'm a lonely old man. I like to talk, too. So why don't we start by talking about what kind of a plan you're working on?
I'm not working on a plan.

## What the hell are you doing?
Don't touch that car.

## What'd you say?
I said you're soft.

## Why don't he just tell 'em the truth?
He knows nobody wants to hear the truth.

## Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.

## Why the hell not?
I saw that hot dog guy in the bathroom urinating. He didn't wash his hands.

## You didn't get ketchup?
Gimme that damn thing.

## Hell of a day for a ballgame, huh, Claude?
Hell of a day, Ray. Yankees are on fire.

## So?
They're touching.

## Yeah? You and what army?
Next thing, you're gonna be complaining about the seats.

## How you doin'?
I'm all right.

## You ever done time before?
You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core.

## What is that?
Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise.

## Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
Those are for trusties, unless you got thirty cents or two packs of cigs.

## Alright, well, let's say you make it to Greenville. What's there, anyway?
Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint.

## You got your own nightclub?
Well, not yet. It's still in the planning stages.

## Why ain't that pick swinging?
Too hot, huh? Well, you tell that lazy jiggaboo the state of Mississippi ain't interested in his meteorological assessments.

## Looks like we got a couple of live ones. How long these boys in for?
Judge gave 'em the long ride.

## You mean Louis Armstrong?
He's a good friend of mine. Drops by the club whenever he's in town.

## Where am I at, man?
C'mon, Goldmouth, somebody's gotta watch the front door.

## Oh, right. Well, why didn't they get those pardons?
That musta messed 'em up pretty bad.

## Man, you really bummed me out. That's a terrible story. Nigger, you crying?
Hell, no! I just got something in my eye.

## What do you think about that?
I think that old man lost his marbles about a hundred years ago. Come on, let's get this over with.

## What were they, bootleggers?
Old man Wilkins' never came out of that bathroom. Died right there on the crapper.

## What are you doing here, mama?
Rayford, I wanted so much more for you than this.

## Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?
He must still be in there.

## Lemonade?
I prefer bourbon.

## What's going on here?
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to teach this uppity nigger a lesson in manners.

## Besides, why bother with bootlegging when we got us a clear cut case of murder?
Mr. Johnson is very well connected. If you were to let us go, I guarantee he would show you his appreciation, if you know what I mean.

## Are you offering me a bribe?
I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.

## Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
Why, my wife gave it to me on our anniversary some years back.

## Must have been some time ago. Maybe forty years?
Something like that, yes.

## She give you that scar, too?
I oughta shoot you for that comment, boy.

## Like you shot Winston Hancock?
I'm gonna work this man's brains out the back of his head.

## Jenny?
No, it says Marleen here.

## Hey, Ray, Goldmouth don't believe me. Ain't it so they got trains up in New York City that run under the streets?
They're called subways. A nickel will take you from one end of Manhattan to the other. Helluva ride, too.

## Who?
Satchmo.

## Hey, Ray, you ever been to the Cotton Club?
Sure I've been to the Cotton Club. It's pretty sweet. But it don't hold a candle to the Boom Boom Room. That's where the real action is.

## You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
That's it. The Boom-Boom Room. Sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running.

## What's your name?
Me? Willie Long.

## What are you in for, Willie?
That's a long story...

## You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
They run but they never get too far.

## What's the Boom Boom Room?
That's my joint. The swinginest nightclub in town.

## Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?
I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.

## Man, that music is hot. What goes on down there, Slim?
That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.

## Blacks welcome there?
Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.

## What's that, some of your bathtub brew?
Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself.

## Where'd you get this?
I'm interested. Keep talking.

## He's sick?
Yeah, he needs souls to live. When you guys left, you broke the gates. We gotta get the gates burning again before he dies.

## Hey, that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay?
Little Nicky.

## Is this a joke?
No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got.

## Now will you get in the flask?
We could create our own hell there.

## You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...

## Well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall?
I lowered the drinking age to ten.

## Why should it end? Who's gonna stop us?
Noon...

## It is awfully hot down here. How do you manage to stay so cool?
Weed lowers the body temperature. I read that... in, uh... er, science magazine.

## Uh. No it won't?
Oh, Nicky, I've missed you. Come on out and say hello...

## She goes to Parson's, right?
I would totally love to go there. But I hear it's really hard to get in.

## Okay, can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom?
My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.

## My mom wasn't a goat?
Try an angel.

## An angel?
Unh-huh. Which would make you half angel.

## Wow. What... what did she look like?
Well, she was about six-three, only spoke Portuguese and had really long grey hair.

## How come you're not older?
Angels don't get any older, son.

## Where did you meet my father?
It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and Hell mixer.

## How did you see me?
We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.

## What is it?
I'm not a hundred percent on that. God said when the time comes, you'll know what to do.

## Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa. Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?
It would be so okay.

## What's Nicky doing down there?
Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.

## Did you just talk?
No.

## That turn you on there, RuPaul?
My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.

## So far, so good. Now what?
Put it in your mouth.

## Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
Got ya. Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?

## What can I do about it?
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.

## Release the evil?
Everything's fine, pop.

## Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
Sure, pop. Whatever you want.

## Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?
Now everybody sit down.

## Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
Metallica, Dad. Come on.

## How bad?
I'm gonna die, Nicky. If the gates are broken, no new souls can get in, which means I'll start to deteriorate into nothing.

## Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers?
No. This can't be happening.

## Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after me. He's always a step ahead. What am I gonna do?
What are you gonna do? Look at me, Nicky! I got no legs, I got no hips, I got one ear...

## You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
Uh, I'll do my best, Dad. Do you have any advice at all for me?

## What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
Listen, I got down low. Your mom's got up high. You take care of the middle.

## I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
Coulda been much worse.

## You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
You got it.

## Bus?
Beast.

## You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius?
I can't enjoy anything. I go fishing. I catch nothing. I go to orgies, I catch everything...

## DEMON I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?

## DEMON You're the spawn of Satan. You got it in you.
You're not saying it's up to me?

## DEMON You were gone ten seconds. What happened?
I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.

## By she, do you mean he?
No.

## What's with that guy?
Gotta be one of his disciples or something.

## Should we wake him up?
Yeah. You do it.

## Did you check out the dragon mouth?
The Dark Prince is here.

## You sure you're down with this?
Little nervous. Wanna puke.

## Which way did he go?
That way.

## What's Ozzy trying to say there?
Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.

## You followed him?
I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.

## You keep a bat under your seat?
Yes, great movie...

## Dude. Seriously?
Yes. I'll meet you at Grand Central at noon. Okay. Do me. I command you.

## It's \"Comptoir Sud Pacific.\" Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?
No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.

## Adrian?
Andrew.

## Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?
That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that.

## I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
The South.

## Really?
Yeah. Deep south. She laughs along with him, not sure why.

## Why are you laughing?
I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.

## Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
If you want to.

## This town is really going to hell lately. So what part of the city do you live in?
I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.

## You have a dog? What kind?
I'm not sure. I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts.

## School?
Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.

## Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
Sometimes, sure.

## What?
Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.

## What was that?
I... I don't know why I just said that. I meant to say that...

## What were you thinking coming here?
I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison.

## Are you dead?
No.

## What are you doing?
I think I'm floating.

## Why would you be floating?
Yes...

## Can we go fly over Central Park?
Next time. Tonight, I want to share the most beautiful thing I could possibly imagine.

## We're going to Jersey?
From my dad's side of the family.

## Yes. What is rent?
Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.

## It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
Yeah. The deep South.

## Why is that funny?
I don't know.

## A black guy?
If it's Cassius, yes.

## Why? Did she hurt you? Do you miss her? Need a shoulder to cry on?
That just hurt a lot.

## I've always wanted to kill someone. Can I do it?
Hey...

## See something you like, my man?
Yes. I would like my flask back.

## You callin' me a thief, my man?
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.

## All right -- what are you?
Your turn.

## We were sent here and you know it. Others have been sent here. Where are they? Hiding?
Hiding? Yes! Hiding, hiding.

## Where do you send them?
You're a beautiful pair.

## That's better. How do you want us?
Nude. Imagine, a pair.

## How do you want us?
Up there.

## How did they get in here?
Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.

## What other food?
It's a real privilege, Sandman.

## Your own work?
And I did it myself right on there.

## I designed it myself. What'll it be... a face job or a full-body job?
Just the face.

## Do you have anything special in mind?
I don't care... Just get it over with.

## Maybe, maybe not. What's the difference? Come on, Logan, let's get out of here before everybody finds out.
You are here. I couldn't believe it when they told me. What are you doing?

## Had enough?
Even the alarm didn't wake him.

## Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
Not in my time...

## Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
Well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering. You know, Logan -- you wonder a lot. Too much for a Sandman.

## I don't know what makes you so curious. You have any idea who his seed-mother was?
Of course not! I'm curious, not sick.

## Who invited you?
I'm in my party mood.

## Yes. But you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?
I just might look in on New You 483 myself.

## Did you ever see anybody renew?
I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions.

## Did you?
Of course.

## Anybody we know?
Look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than I do.

## What's your name?
I'm Mary 2.

## Where do you live, Mary?
Here.

## Why aren't you in Nursery?
I'm very smart.

## When do you go up?
I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady.

## What's wrong, Available?
Please... No.

## You prefer women?
No.

## Well then...?
Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.

## Sad? What made you sad?
A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone.

## Yes... probably he was renewed?
He was killed.

## Killed? Why do you use that word?
Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.

## I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners. Who brought you?
Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit.

## You felt sad. What's your name?
Jessica.

## And?
I changed my mind.

## And now?
Curious.

## About what?
How a Sandman lives.

## I suppose. But what if you want to live?
So? Do what everyone does. Try like hell for renewal.

## Are you a 5 or a 6?
Six. I go red next year.

## What Quad do you live in?
K.

## You're sure you don't want to try?
You could have called me yourself.

## Here I am. Shall I come in?
I couldn't get you out of my mind.

## I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
Maybe... sure...

## You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
You know.

## Why show me?
I'm going to run.

## Why tell me?
You know something.

## About running, dying what?
Both... running's what I'm interested in.

## Where did you get that?
A Runner gave it to me.

## And then you killed him, right?
I let him go... believe me.

## Please? What friends?
I don't have much time.

## What're you going to do?
That's tomorrow.

## We're coming to Arcade. Shall we Relive together?
A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.

## You're not going, are you?
Why not? Maybe she'll help me. You won't. You'd better stay here.

## I'm only telling you what I've heard... Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
Uh-uh.

## Let's see -- how long has it been?
Just follow -- no matter how it seems...

## I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed.
But what is this -- why?

## Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.

## Because he's my friend -- and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.
Are you taking me to them?

## He's good, isn't he?
Will he find us and kill us? Yes... or one of the others. You know there's only one place to go now...

## How will they know we're coming?
They're watching us now. They'll let us in when they're sure.

## Will you take me with you?
Why, Jessica? You're still a green.

## How do we know this is the right way?
It's the only way.

## What do you suppose this was...?
Some kind of breeding pens... I suppose... They say people used to breed animals, fish, anything... ...to eat, of course.

## I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but -- Are you glad you didn't kill him?
It doesn't make any difference anymore.

## I wanted to... ...And you... what made you kill Sandmen?
I had to. I did kill... for the first time in my life I killed.

## What's that?
It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.

## Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?
I doubt it.

## Do you think he was telling the Truth?
Maybe we're the first ones to get through... Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... another protected place. It couldn't be outside.

## What does it mean?
The Lifeclocks have no power outside.

## You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
You know, Jessica.

## ...But I still have the choice...?
Of course.

## Look at his face... and his hair... Is that what it is to grow old?
It could be...

## That sweet madman -- how could he come to exist?
He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.

## You want to go back to kill, is that it?! Now, you'll want to kill your own!!! Kill Sandmen!!! Killing's all you ever...!!!
I want to be alive and with you, that's all I want.

## And Sanctuary?
Sanctuary is the right to live... nothing more. But nothing less, either...

## What does that water do?
It's part of the hydrogalvanic system. The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.

## Is it inside the city?
Of course. I don't know where... I just took them for granted. It's our only chance.

## And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother?
Yes...

## What kind of jewel is this?
I don't know.

## You're both full of secrets like Macavity. Did you steal this?
All this. All of it.

## What people?
I don't know... but it does.

## What's that?
They're put into the ground so they can be visited by the living...

## Where are you going?
Goodbye.

## Do you want to see Doc?
We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.

## A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.

## My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
No -- Look, I'm in a hurry.

## How long have you been living here?
For as long as I can remember.

## How did you get here?
I have always been here...

## Are there any other humans?
Gracious... no.

## Have any other people ever passed through?
But there may be a few around somewhere.

## Where are they?
Dead... they're dead... and buried.

## They're beautiful. May I have one too please?
No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.

## Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
Never, never, ever. Nothing.

## Are you ready to put him in?
Not yet.

## Thousands and thousands... as many as my cats?
More... many more.

## Is that really it? It doesn't seem very far. Will we be there soon?
I promise. We'll go on as soon as it's light.

## Stay? They lived together all their years?
Oh, yes... I think...

## Can you make it back?
Oh my... I'll try.

## Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...?
Someone will follow. When you come to the lock, he will tell you how to go on the other side. Jessica may go with you as far as the lock.

## Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
Too little.

## You're not contagious are you?
I don't think so.

## Good... You up for a drive?
Where to? Hey, Lanie, I heard you were out of it for a while, too.

## Sure, what's wrong with that?
Okay.

## Texaco... What's wrong with that?
Listen.

## You want somethin'?
No, I'm okay.

## What's happenin'?
They're comin' with us.

## Pete... You okay?
Yeah.

## I'm, okay... You okay?
Sure, I'm okay.

## Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
This is our bedroom.

## You're a musician?
Yes, I thought my wife...

## What do you mean by that?
How I remember them. Not necessarily the way they happened.

## Why not?
It kept going off for some reason. False alarms.

## Why not?
I forgot. Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid.

## What is?
The angle. The high angle shot on the tape.

## Do you own a video camera?
No. Fred hates them.

## Maid? Relative?
No, one of us is always here to let the maid in. Nobody else has a key.

## How'd the camera get so high like that?
And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.

## Or not so recently?
Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to.

## You recognize that guy?
Yeah... Laurent.

## His or ours?
Ours, Ed.

## What's that, Ed?
There's no such thing as a bad coincidence.

## How would you like to take me to dinner?
I don't know.

## Can I call you?
Yeah... Call me at home. I'll give you the number.

## Pete?
Me, too.

## Are you positive he knows?
I'm not positive... but... he knows.

## So what do we do?
I don't know.

## Have you partied with him?
I used to.

## You like it?
No, honey... It was part of the deal.

## What deal?
He works for Mr. Eddy.

## What's he do?
He makes films for Mr. Eddy.

## How'd you get in with these fuckin' people?
Pete... Don't...

## How'd it happen, Alice?
It was a long time ago... I met someone at this place called Moke's... we became friends. He told me about a job...

## In pornos?
No... A job... I didn't know what. He set up an appointment for me to see a man.

## Andy?
That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.

## Why are ya goin' so early?
Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.

## What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny.

## What about tonight?... Whatiya gonna do about Mr. Eddy tonight?
I'm not goin' home tonight... I'm goin' somewhere else... To a girlfriend's house. But, we still have a coupla things to take care of...

## Are you my man?
Yes.

## Are you gonna be a man about this, Pete?
You got him.

## You all right?
We killed him.

## Alice?
Alice...

## Where's the bathroom?
Up the stairs - down the hall.

## Andy, who is that guy?
I don't know his name. He's a friend of Dick Laurent's, I think.

## Dick Laurent?
Yes, I believe so.

## He is? I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead?
I don't. I don't know him.

## Wonderful!!... Wonderful to see you, Pete. How are you?
Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.

## Mr. Smith has been waiting for you and Mrs. Trueworthy. Can you take care of Mr. Smith now?
Sure.

## Mr. Eddy's called every day... Can I call him to come in?
Sure, Arnie. Bring 'em on, I'm ready.

## What night is that?
The night before you showed up in the slammer...

## What's up?
Sit down.

## I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
The police called us.

## Yeah? what did they want?
They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.

## Sheila?
Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do.

## Did you tell the police this?
We're not saying anything about that night to the police. We should all forget that night.

## What happened to me?
Please tell me.

## The wife killer?
Yes.

## His condition? What do you mean?
His physical condition.

## Have you made any charges against him?
No.

## Where's Pete?
Out in back.

## You talk to him?
No... Here he comes.

## Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.

## Where is he now?
He's in the infirmary, being examined.

## Did you ask him who he is?
He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway.

## If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.

## How about Madison? Have we had even a hint of his whereabouts?
Nothing, Marsh. Vanished. There's an APB out on him. His photo's been faxed nationwide.

## You just gonna let him go?
We'll get a tail put on him.

## Now, Mack, what's the situation?
I'm not entirely certain, Captain. You'll have to see for yourself.

## That's not Fred Madison?
No, sir, it's not.

## Yeah, Mack?
Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.

## You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
When he went to work, right.

## What about yesterday?
He didn't come home.

## Pete, what happened to you?
No... I don't feel so good. I would like some aspirin.

## What's the matter?
Nothin'.

## Who is it?
He won't give his name.

## What is this, Rogoff?
I don't know yet.

## Who is this man?
He's just been fingerprinted, and I'll run these blood tests right away. We'll find out soon enough.

## He's not Madison?
Not even close.

## WHAT DID YOU SAY?
I... I didn't say anything...

## DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
No.

## There's no other bedroom?
No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.

## What's your axe?
Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you...

## Did you use the alarm system since we were here last?
The first night... Not the last two.

## Something wrong?
My... My head.

## What's bothering you, Madison?
The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.

## What is it?
Aspirin... fly head. I gotta have more aspirin.

## No, no I don't. Are you sure?
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.

## What do you mean? You're where right now?
At your house.

## What are you going to do?
I thought I'd stay home and read.

## What's that?
A videotape.

## Who's it from?
I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.

## Does it say anything on the tape?
No, nothing.

## Good book, huh?
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.

## What night?
When you didn't come to the club.

## Called? When?
From the club. You didn't answer.

## I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
You were asleep when I got home, yes.

## Yeah?
You were in the house... calling my name... but I couldn't find you.

## What's that? Another tape?
Yes, I just found it on the step.

## Don't you want to watch it?
I guess so.

## So?
On the tape! There was something else on the tape.

## Where would you feel safe?
I don't know. Maybe a hotel.

## I thought you were getting me a drink?
Just a minute.

## What job?
I thought there might be somebody inside.

## Was there?
No... of course not.

## Did you see that about the guy who chopped up his wife into a million pieces?
How could I miss it? The TV won't quit with that stuff.

## Which would you choose?
Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.

## Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
The heart, I guess.

## What happened? Somebody givin' you trouble?
I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.

## At sixty?
Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.

## Pornos?
Yeah. Give ya a boner.

## Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today.

## How ya doin', Pete?
Okay.

## What?
I'd pull the trigger and shoot him right between the eyes.

## Who is this?
You know who it is.

## Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?
Okay.

## You sure you're doin' okay? Everything all right?
Yeah.

## At your house. Don't you remember?
No. No, I don't.

## What's goin' on?
I missed you.

## What are you guys doin'?
Guess we're goin' over to the \"Ten Pin\".

## You want some company?
Sure.

## Why haven't you called me?
Sorry... I...

## What's happening to you? What happened to your face?
I don't know.

## What night?
Last time I saw you.

## I don't remember... What happened that night?
You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.

## Whatiya mean?
You were acting like a different person.

## You still care about me?
Sure. Sure I do.

## You really don't remember?
No... I told you.

## Whatiya mean, Sheila?
I don't want to talk about it...

## Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
I don't know.

## Why don't you like me?
I do like you, Sheila.

## Where'd you come from?
I've been here. You were lookin, right at me.

## I was?
Yeah.

## You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
Yes. Might as well - all of it.

## Not even a radio?
It's always been a source of deep regret, but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible.

## What about those men we met this morning?
Yes. Those are our own people. They never venture beyond the point where you were met this morning. It is much too hazardous.

## Two years!?
Yes.

## I beg your pardon, brother. What did you say you were hunting?
Fossils.

## Fossils, huh?
I'm a paleontologist.

## A what?
A paleontologist.

## Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it?
Not at all.

## Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.

## Yes, it just shows I don't know why I'm talking to you. I don't know you. Who are you?
Okay, brother.

## Wait a minute. Is it a good morning? Say, we're supposed to be traveling east, aren't we?
Why, of course. Yes.

## Is it?
It certainly is.

## Oh, really?
Yes.

## All right, all right. Keep quiet.
Yes. And who is he ? How'd he get there?

## Do you think they're cannibals?
Mr. Barnard, I do not like this place. I definitely do not like this place.

## Thinking? What about some double solitaire?
As a matter of fact, I'm very good at double solitaire.

## No kidding?
Yes.

## Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
Have I?

## They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.
The police?

## Horns?
Yeah. You know.

## Horns? What kind of horns?
Hey Lovey, come here! Lovey, I asked for a glass of wine and look what I got. Come on, sit down.

## Wonder what's happened to Fenner.
Oh my, isn't that pretty! What is it?

## What are we going to do?
Well, there's nothing we can do until the morning.

## It's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?
I'll say.

## Mr. Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas, do we get the porters?
It's unbelievable.

## All right.
Say, what about that gold deal?

## I say, will you have a cigarette?
No.

## Nothing. Why?
Why, you look beautiful.

## Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
Oh, that's a cinch. I'll show them how to cast pipes out of clay.

## Cave, eh? Where?
Over by that hill.

## When are you going to start?
Right this very minute! The porters are waiting for us on the plateau. And that Chinaman thought he could stop me. Come along.

## Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey. She'll stick around too. Is that right?
And mine's Conway.

## Where is your mad pilot?
He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead.

## So there are others?
Oh, yes.

## Who, for instance?
In time you will meet them all.

## By the way, what religion do you follow here?
We follow many.

## You have no disputes over women?
Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.

## Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?
Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her.

## That would suit me perfectly. I'm always broke. How did you pay for them?
Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely ...

## buy and sell?
Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange .

## He amputated his own leg?
Well, they didn't actually mean that.

## You're startled?
Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all.

## One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
The only one.

## And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.

## Well, then he's the man I want to see. Will you come along?
Yes. I'm afraid it does.

## Shall we have another?
No thanks. Not tonight if you don't mind.

## Charming, isn't she?
Yes, charming.

## Amazing! She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?
Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.

## Suppose she should leave it?
Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.

## No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?
Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.

## It's weird. Chang, how old are you?
You must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey. He could never get through that country alive.

## What exactly do you mean by \"almost any time now\"?
Splendid!

## I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?
Oh, immediately.

## Are you so certain you are away from it?
As far away as I ever want to be.

## Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
Yes.

## Sit here, near me. I am an old man and can do no one any harm.
Are you taking me?

## Are you the High Lama?
Yes.

## That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea?
Sondra Bizet.

## Oh, the girl at the piano?
Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all.

## Mine?
Because, my son, I am placing in your hands the future and destiny of Shangri-La. For I am going to die.

## Yes.
Do you think this will come in my time?

## Hello? Colonel?
The power house - they've blown it up! The planes can't land without lights.

## You?
Hurray!

## Hello, Freshie. Did you make that report out yet?
Yes, Bob.

## Did you say we saved ninety white people?
Yes.

## George, what are you going to do?
I'm going to drag him out and force him to tell us what his game is.

## What are these people?
I don't know. I can't get the dialect.

## It looks like it. Smell those fumes?
He's dead.

## See that spot?
Yes.

## What's it mean?
It means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached.

## Hello, George. Cigarette?
Thanks. I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.

## What are you talking about?
I don't know.

## Don't you ever want to see what's on the other side of the hill?
Of course you would. If ever we get out of this place, the thing for you to do is to take that job with Helen's father.

## Did I say \"if\"?
That's what you said.

## Porters?
Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.

## Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
I'm afraid the porters are just a myth. I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.

## I don't see that there's anything to say.
What about the porters?

## Why not? What's going to stop me?
You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.

## So you think it's all nonsense, huh?
I don't need any proof.

## Is that all my story meant to you?
What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.

## Well, I can't think of anything more to say. Goodbye, Bob.
George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you?

## George, are you sure of the porters? About their taking care of you, I mean?
Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements.

## Maria?
Yes, the little Russian girl.

## You say the porters are waiting for us?
Yes.

## What about the others?
I've already asked them. They're afraid to make the trip. We'll have to send an expedition back after them.

## Can't you shut up? Must you go on babbling like an idiot?
Bob, can't you get them to wait for us? They're leaving us farther behind every day.

## Where did you come from?
I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.

## Good.
Why aren't you registered through our office?

## What if he refuses?
We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.

## Brilliant! Can anyone here fly a plane?
I guess we're in for it.

## In for what?
I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner. When he lands, we'll find out.

## Imagine having all that fuel there, waiting for us! George, something tells me our journey is just beginning.
You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?

## Where are we going? Huh?
Oh, you mean my pigeons.

## Was this your idea?
Yes. Hold this pigeon.

## You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
That was easy. I read your books.

## Oh, you've read my books. You do more things! What have my books got to do with it?
I saw a man whose life was empty.

## Oh, you're going to make life very simple.
I really only brought you here to show you my pigeons!

## I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
I'm so glad.

## Bump?
When the plane lands at Shangri-La and wakes us all up.

## You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?
Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.

## Why?
Oh, the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence.

## Struggling, why?
Well, everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself, accumulate a nest egg, and so on.

## Why?
You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.

## I've thought about it for years. I knew you'd come. And I knew if you did - you'd never leave. Am I forgiven for sending for you?
It would serve you right if you were left behind.

## It's Fenner.
Couldn't you arrange to make a little less noise?

## What do you want him to do?
I don't know. I'm a paleontologist, not a Foreign Secretary.

## What is it?
Mountain grass. It's good, too. Here, have some. I've read of people lasting thirty days on this stuff.

## Go? Where?
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.

## I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
Hesitated, sir.

## So... this door. It's... not an exit... ?
It's not even a fucking door.

## And Goodwill Toward Man?
No. just peace on Earth.

## And if I say yes?
Your supervisors have no idea why you're here.

## What's so funny, cadet Cowan?
Well... you know, when you say \"normal,\" what, exactly...

## Mrs. Edelson?
Only the damn guy won't know it.

## What happens if I say no?
Yes, sir.

## Everybody, listen up, we've had a tremendous amount of movement lately. Be aware. Be safe. Have a good day. Oh, uh... Cowan?
All the time, sir.

## You do?
Yes, air. But I'm usually wrong. Sir.

## Which do you have your money on, Dee?
I'd go with number three.

## Three, huh? Really? Cause a cup of coffee says we're talking about... number... four? Huh? No?
I wasn't scared...

## Helluva night, isn't it?
Yup. Sure is.

## Home? You gotta be kidding me. Black?
Dee. God damn it. I told you to go home.

## What? Who the hell are you?
INS, Washington. Special services.

## Why? What are you gonna do?
Actually that's a very good question. The answer-- if You'll Just look at this Part-- is here.

## What?
You heard me. You two, especially.

## So what's the problem?
It's the way we do it. The way we've always done it.

## What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock?
I taught kindergarten.

## Kay, um... how, uh, fast does this thing actually go ... ?
Let's see... that was second gear..Kay shifts into THIRD. Jay winces.

## If it was just a meal, why did they have so much luggage?
I dunno. Maybe it was baby supplies, Kay starts the car, starts to pull a U-turn.

## Well, Mr. Intuition... When the neighbors report screaming and we hear nothing but silence, what does that lead you to believe?
I guess it's simple, huh? They're either gone... or dead.

## Now what?
A signazoid's eleven thousand pounds. I think we'd know if held left.

## Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?
Hold it.

## Jeebs is eager to have me deport him. But would rather kill himself than go downtown. Why?
I dunno. Why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner?.

## What?
Looks like a train ticket.

## What's going on, Kay?
I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.

## The radio show?
No. The aliens organized, all of them, and tried a coup. They made it seem like a radio show afterwards.

## You think that's what's-happening?
I think that's what's happening...

## That's the Loch Ness Monster. And... Kay-- that's... 444-Eyes?
Jesus...

## Where's it coming? Where's he landing?
The Pentagon.

## What if he's telling the truth?
Well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true.

## Since how long?
Since as long as we've been keeping records...

## For how long?
We saw it in the office. It went from this big... to big... in a day.

## Well, if the bugs have hatched, and they're not here... then where are they?
It's marble.

## Would you call this a code 100?
In case I need it.

## Why does it feel like the only thing scarier than having a bunch of aliens on the planet... is having then leave the planet?
Yeah. His dream and our worst nightmare.

## Kay. Seriously. What if he actually means what he says?
So, I guess you could say you're really into insects...

## So... how'd you hear about this?
Oh, yeah, well, you know. I'm a big fan. I've read all your work.

## With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
Exactly. I very much enjoy that.

## Do have any idea what I just said?
Once-- just once-- I thought I'd made the discovery of a lifetime...

## It's hard to find. It's an old civil war cemetery. Nobody ever goes there. So... what is it you say you do?
I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.

## Why not?
Well, first of all, it's entomologist.

## What is it?
It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen. And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.

## But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
Man, hey-- maybe you are an entopologist after all.

## When?
It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.

## So... how did they get here?
What do we do? Lean into it.

## What the hell does that mean?
Actually... I don't know.

## Out of focus?
The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.

## Yeah ... ?
Well I'm going to give them something to be afraid of.

## What a coincidence, cause I was just thinking about you, too, Jack. Recognize this?
No.

## You figured what?
Your licence is revoked. Permanently.

## I understand. I understand, thank you. --How about a transmographic dexahydrochlorophallomixaloosalyser?
Come on now. People are smart.

## Not bad. Briliiant, actually. You come unarmed, and alone. Cause your army's been growing underground for what? 100 years? 150?
Give or take. It was right around your civil war, I think, when I was here last. We were waiting till your planet was warm enough.

## Try seven. From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident. You wanna tell me what's going on? Huh?
It's... coming.

## Yeah, I'll talk to you.
What are you talking about, it's coming? What's coming?

## ... recent landings within a hundred mile radius of Sudbury, Virginia?
Nothing.

## Nothing at all? Now? Last month? Anything in the last few years?
Nope. Nothing at all.

## Did our friend announce when he's making his speech?
Noon exactly.

## How'd you know that? Kay?
Cause I think we're looking at it.

## What if I don't?
In about 10 seconds they're gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute.

## Will it lower the curve?
I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make. Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.

## This guy. Where was he?
We're from Scientific American. We read about your discovery. We'd like to take a look.

## This it?
Yeah. Nov I know it looks normal, but watch this.

## We need to talk to you about the alien.
Come again?

## Which way?
Fine. Good.

## Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
I need you in Philadelphia. I got a code 90, in a-high school.

## What the hell is going on?
He's gone, too.

## What about the other agents? Ella? Tee?
Even that little bug you found in Sudbury seems to have taken off.

## Jesus, everyone's moving. Could be an assembly. Does it look aggressive?
Hard to tell. I hope not.

## Dee? What are you doing here?
I'm getting a trajectory...

## And they're buying it?
They went right to the President.

## They went to the President? Directly? THEY WENT OVER OUR HEADS?
As far as I can tell, the guy's what he says he is - alone, and unarmed. All he wants is five minutes to introduce himself to the public.

## Where's he making his big speech?
They haven't announced it yet. All I know is we're in motion for the most watched media event in history.

## And get this, you know how humans evolved from primates? Well guess what the dominant life form on planet evolved from?
Don't tell me. Insects.

## How'd you know?
Just a guess. But I think found a nest.

## Now, what are we looking at? Keys. Look at them all. Why do we have them? Mr. President?
Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.

## If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering?
They're inside.

## Who?
Drop some money.

## What is it?
Anderton --

## Where are we going?
Someplace safe.

## Why?
The other two will die without me.

## You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?
Agatha, you're never going back there.

## Who wanted her little girl back?
The drowning woman. Anne... But it was too late. Her little girl was already gone.

## She died?
She grew up.

## She's still alive?
She's not alive, but she didn't die.

## Then who was he?
Just some guy... they found.

## Found? Where?
Somewhere.

## Think, John. Why would they set you up?
Because I found out about her...

## About who?
Anne Lively...

## How did I not see this? Agatha, who killed you mother? Who killed Anne Lively?
That's comforting.

## Why?
Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care? They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.

## We know each other?
Oh, yes.

## From where? D.C.?
So uh, if you were a plastic surgeon before...

## The nano... what?
I'm setting up a timer. When it goes off tomorrow, take off your bandages and get the hell out of here. But not before then, or you'll --

## You the sentry?
Yes, sir. I'm Gideon. The music relaxes the prisoners.

## I don't ever see any of you precops down here, I'm not in trouble am I?
No, you're not in trouble. I'm interested in a murder.

## Kill type?
Drowning.

## This about the Justice Department? They laid on a tour for tomorrow a.m. Told me to wear a tie. You like this one?
That's an old one. One of our first.

## This is the official composite of the three precogs?
That's right. It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.

## You the only sentry?
I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.

## Why's he still a John Doe? Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
On account of those are not his eyes. He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.

## So she cleaned up. Where is she now?
You're part of my flock now, John. Welcome.

## You can let him look around, answer his questions, but watch him. If there's any problems, make sure we know about it first.
Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?

## I understand. What's the other thing?
Tuck in your shirt.

## And you say the third prevision was, what, a little fuzzy or something?
Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --

## What?
She's worried about you. And, quite frankly, so am I.

## What if Danny Witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run?
I'm fine, Lamar.

## Justice already knows. Talk to me, John. Tell me what's happening?
This is all Witwer. He's setting me up.

## Stop. Just wait. Who's the victim?
Somebody named Leo Crow.

## And who the hell is that?
I have no idea. I've never heard of him. But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.

## Can you fake the cerebral output?
We're years from that. John, I'm asking you, please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.

## You don't have to chase me, Fletcher.
You're kidding, that's today?

## Okay, Jad, what's coming?
Red Ball -- double homicide, one male, one female. Killer's male, white, 40's.

## Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route. What's our confirmed time?
From solar position, Trig & Image confirms it at approximately eight oh-four a.m.

## Somewhere near the capital?
No maglev system.

## The mall?
Georgetown.

## Yeah? So?
Now look at him...

## Come on, Chief, you think about it, the way we work -- changing destiny and all -- we're more like clergy than cops.
Did he close the front door?

## Sir?
Go back to work. All of you.

## Jad. How come you're not out there with Father Witwer?
We're in motion on something.

## Red Ball?
Nope. Somebody's thinking about this one.

## Any ID on the shooter yet?
Still scrubbing... looks like there's a third party, somebody wearing shades just out the window...

## But it's not the future if you stop it. Isn't that a fundamental paradox?
Yes, it is.

## Why did you catch that?
Because it was going to fall.

## You're certain?
Yes.

## Then why can't they see rapes, or assaults... or suicides?
It was Iris Hineman. She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface.

## To Hineman?
To them.

## Really? You've never been inside?
We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.

## So I'll be the first one to go in then?
Maybe you didn't hear me.

## What does he think of your chosen line of work?
I don't know. He was shot and killed when I was fourteen on the steps of his church in Bethesda.

## Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
Flaws.

## You gonna tell on me?
Possession alone will cost you six months, not to mention your badge.

## Her pituitary dumped a week's worth into her system... What did you do to her?
Nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen...

## To you? I don't think so... What'd she say?
She said...

## Do I know you? Who are you?
I like you, Wally, so I'm not gonna kick you, or hit you with anything, but only if you promise to help me...

## Are these all of her previsions?
I need your help.

## She's a precog?
That's right.

## Are you reading my mind right now?
Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.

## So?
So now I need you to hack into her.

## What happened? Where's the rest?
Four. Wow. What a big boy. I love you, Sean.

## Wanna hear something funny?
What the hell.

## You're alive?
No. He got tired of pretending.

## Who are you?
His name was Sean. Six years ago. Francis pool.

## You're not gonna kill me?
No.

## Tell me, who was it, set this up?
If I tell you, my family gets nothing.

## Good-bye, Crow.
Who made you do this?

## Something wrong?
I'm a little dizzy...

## The what?
The vine -- the Baneberry that scratched you during your illegal climb over my wall...

## Just what is it you think I can do for you?
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.

## What's so funny?
You don't seem all that proud.

## Heal who?
The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.

## You say some of the children died?
I'm not a murderer. I've never even met the man I'm supposed to kill.

## So you won't help me?
I can't help you. No one can. The Precogs are never wrong.

## Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.

## You're saying that I've halo'd innocent people?
I'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might, just might, have an alternate future.

## Answer my question. Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?
Yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.

## Do you? Really?
You want to bring it down.

## Why should I trust you?
You said they're destroyed.

## What safe place is that?
The safest place of all.

## Where?
Inside the Precog who predicted it. All you have to do is download it.

## How do I even know which one has it?
It's always in the more gifted of the three.

## Which one is that?
The female.

## John?
He's dead, Lara.

## Oh, God, what did you do?
This is all my fault.

## Who?
Anne Lively. John was talking about her right before they took him.

## Lamar --
Anne Lively... But I never said she drowned.

## How did you get this?
I padded your expense account for the last six months.

## He came to see you yesterday. Right before he got tagged. What did you talk about?
The Mets. John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.

## Six years ago. What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
None of your damn business.

## What?
I don't wanna say over the phone, but I think we may be chasing the wrong man.

## Good God. What was that?
Wait, just a second...

## He told me about this. You got this from Containment?
It's the same prevision.

## I did find it. It was inside of Agatha all this time. So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
Danny, tell me what you're thinking.

## How?
Precog Deja Vu...

## So there is a way to fool the system?
I wanna kill my boss.

## Uh-huh. Okay. You got some images I can work with?
Right here.

## Nice to meet you. Gum?
So if you wanna kill someone, you take him to Miami.

## Can't they shut that off?
That's the Red Ball Alarm.

## People have gotten the message. Gum?
The information we need is embedded in the grain of wood. And since each piece is unique, the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate.

## No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
Because he thinks he's innocent.

## Two?
It doesn't matter. He wins.

## If you were a child killer, you took these pictures, would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?
They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.

## I was a Treasury Agent for eight years. Why?
Treasury... Then this would be your first actual murder scene.

## How many?
None. This was arranged.

## That's why you asked to partner with me on this little sortie, isn't it?
Cause all of a sudden you got no one you can fucking brown nose anymore.

## Who?
The man across the street. I've seen him before...

## What about your meeting?
I'll reschedule. I've been working too much anyway.

## Raincheck?
Sure. Raincheck.

## This your work?
Yes.

## Thanks. You take anything in your coffee?
Cream and sugar.

## Just sugar then. You and John ever come here?
We used to, every summer.

## He's not here now, is he?
I don't have any sugar either.

## Thank you. He hasn't tried to contact you?
No.

## You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.

## So you haven't seen his apartment?
That was our apartment.

## Have you been there recently?
Since right after we lost our son.

## But John was with him at the pool?
Yes.

## What was it then?
The FBI found something that belonged to my son. A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he...

## To what? Trap him?
To prevent a murder. Sooner or later, he's going to contact you.

## What does he want with a precog?
What do you think? So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.

## Wally, the other two can still function, right?
You don't understand... they're a hive mind. It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.

## Are you telling me they can't see murders anymore?
Jesus...

## What are you talking about?
Maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. He wants you to come by the office today.

## You're Bobby, right?
Yeah.

## He'll be a minute, hon. You want some coffee?
No thank you.

## Is it a good room?
I can take you down there.

## Just tell me. Wait, here... Do you have change of a hundred?
Not on me, sir.

## Are you sure?
Yeah. Take it.

## Is it the good room?
All the suites are about the same.

## What if I gave you forty?
It's as good a suite as we have, unless you want two bedrooms.

## Women?
Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway.

## So, wait, you're from where?
Manhattan.

## You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything?
No.

## I don't get it. What do you do?
We're in Fashion.

## So you're models?
I don't know about you guys, but I'm starting to feel a really sexual vibe here.

## Is he cute?
He's okay.

## Should I fuck him?
I don't know. Do whatever you want.

## He's great, right. Is he great?
He's alright.

## Nobody's fuckin talking to you.
What the fuck was that about?

## And how could you fucking leave Horrace hanging?
I got news for you, Horrace got his ass out of there before you did.

## What? You don't think Horrace would leave your white ass in there to hang?
Ricky's not wearing one.

## A elephant seal. Where's mommy?
She's, uh, sleeping.

## Mommy works hard so you can have all your pretty clothes. Don't you like your pretty clothes?
No.

## What's wrong, baby?
He's not doing it.

## Hi, baby. What are you doing awake? Where's mommy?
I don't know.

## Mommy's not home?
No.

## Can you take me to Color Me Mine?
Yeah. Are you sure mommy's not home? It's very late.

## No. What kind of bachelor party?
The easy kind. They're young and rich and well mannered.

## A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. It's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money.

## I don't like you working with Wendy. Why are you working with Wendy?
They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.

## Who's watching the baby?
She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.

## You talk to Max today?
I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.

## No coke tonight. Right?
Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.

## Yeah? You sure?
Go.

## With what?
Max offered to stake me.

## How could you let her see this?
Goodbye, Bobby.

## What'd you say?
I want you to take her with you.

## But what about them?
I don't give a shit. I work for her. No touching.

## Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
Your dance is over.

## It's already been a hell of a night. Where you been?
I had a fight up at Sportsman's.

## Well, you look it. You win?
Draw.

## What's your record at?
5-5-1.

## You driving her?
Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy.

## What's his name?
Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.

## Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
Shit.

## Why isn't Ruiz coming?
This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.

## What's that?
A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.

## Where is this happening?
We meet at the Globe on Park Avenue at six forty-five. I'll see you then.

## Now, here's what worries me. He said he wants to meet up at a bar in Red Hook. You know where that is?
No.

## Yeah?
He must have that shit troughed.

## Ruiz tied in out there?
Nah, man. No one is. They got some Puerto Ricans and a new crop of fuckin Irish immigrants.

## Where we going?
Quick drop. In and out.

## Where's Ricky?
Ricky's taken care of.

## How so?
He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. He's meeting us there.

## That it?
That's it.

## You like the ponies?
Sure. Yeah.

## You bet the ponies?
Me? No. Not really.

## Why?
It's fixed. That's the only way to win. A sure thing. See that horse. The blaze.

## This one?
Pshhh...

## She was fast, huh?
That's why they call it the smart money.

## I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?
Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.

## What?
You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul.

## So, that's it. I'm out?
I didn't say that.

## Then what are you saying?
No.

## Now you wanna shut up and listen and hear what I got to say?
Yeah. Sorry.

## Ruiz knows about this?
Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth.

## Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
You told him you liked him.

## You vouch for him?
Yeah. Sure.

## Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask?
No. Okay. I'll think about it.

## What drill?
We get it. We're sorry.

## Tom, the Welsh dude --
What's the plan?

## You three are gonna meet him for dinner. Find out if and where. Now any of you motherfuckers got anything else to say?
Hi. I, uh, think that's us.

## You're going to the Soho Grand hotel, right?
I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.

## Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
Nah.

## Where is the Soho Grand?
Soho.

## So, Jimmy, you know where this address is?
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.

## You don't know where you're going?
No. Just the cross streets.

## Spa?
Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.

## Understand me?
Yeah.

## Aren't we waiting for Ricky?
Ricky's taken care of.

## Taken care of?
Yeah, he's getting there on his own.

## So's this. Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying?
Listen, man, we really gotta...

## I be off in a minute. Say again...?
We're with Ruiz.

## We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though.

## Can you check?
He's not here.

## What are you saying?
You said if you didn't have a winning record after eleven fights, you'd talk to Max.

## So?
So, it was a draw.

## How am I being shitty?
Don't be shitty.

## Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
Yeah. I know the number.

## I'll page you with the number. I'll see you later. What time you done?
I got no idea.

## Then why do you try to get in?
Fuck them.

## Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
You wanna go right now?

## What are we delivering?
We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.

## Who is this fucking Ruiz?
Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.

## How'd you unlock my phone?
I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.

## See? Now everyone's got one on. What do you got there?
Why can't we just grab a goddamn beer.

## What? Did she say something?
She wants you to paint the ashtray.

## Who's driving her?
I don't know.

## Is that the woman from..?
She really liked the kitchen.

## Holy shit. Can you believe this?
Pretty nice.

## What's the movie?
I'll get the girl.

## You sure?
Yeah. He said that's our account with the car service.

## Shhh... Hello, room service?
C'mon, man...

## How much is it?
How much? Okay. Make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. Bye.

## How much was it?
Forty-six.

## Jesus, man. Plus ten?
Yeah, I guess.

## Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
Don't worry about it. Just be smart.

## Who's gonna smell me a mile away?
Don't play dumb. You know what I'm talking about.

## What are you doing?
I know you're not calling Jimmy.

## As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem with that?
We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.

## Shit. It's thirty-five cents. You got a dime?
Fuck...

## What exactly did they say?
They said a hundred thirty-fifth and Twelfth.

## They didn't say an address?
I told you what they said.

## How'd they know who you were?
They asked who it was.

## What the fuck do you have to complain about?
Don't even start.

## You know this guy?
His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade.

## Yeah. What vibe?
I detected no vibe other than that Ruiz thinks you're a fucking idiot.

## So is this the drop?
Like I said, I don't know.

## He woulda told us right?
You would think.

## You too?
Yeah, me too. You're a fucking bull in a china shop.

## Where do you think you're going?
Back in.

## You fucking nuts?
Work's over. I'm gonna party.

## What the hell did you do?
I swear to God, I didn't do anything.

## What the fuck was that about?
She was jonesing for me.

## What's up?
He wants to see us now.

## Where?
He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know.

## Why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is?
It's not a 'sit down.' He said he's telling us the plan.

## I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.
You gonna shank him in the shower?

## Yeah. Where they gonna whack us?
Nothing, man.

## You want us strapped, don't you?
Let's do it.

## The what?
The penguin house.

## Wait a minute. You want to look at fucking penguins now?
Yeah. Let's look at the penguins.

## Did you hear what he just said?
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.

## You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?
That's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden.

## You're out of money?
No.

## What do you have left?
Eighty.

## Eighty bucks?!?
Eighty five.

## What happened to the fifteen hundred?
They only cover one fifty in incidentals. You've been ordering fucking... Motherfucker...

## So what do we do?
Let's just go now and wait.

## Three and a half hours?
I don't want to take any more chances.

## Where do you get this shit?
You're not getting a gun.

## Look. They're together. You telling me this ain't a set-up?
Easy...

## I'll drop you off in a minute. I want to see if the baby's up. You wanna come in?
No. I'll wait here.

## Fine, fine. And you were...?
Bobby and Ricky.

## And you grew up in Manhattan?
Yeah. I want it.

## How is it you're good? You on a list?
Yeah. Ricky Slade.

## What?
Cardiff Giant. Just check.

## Again with the fucking China Club! What do I look like a fucking Persian to you?
Hey. I'm half Lebanese.

## Did you see that shit? Motherfucker. You let in fucking Screech, dude? I'm waiting and you let in Screech?
He's on the list.

## You look big, man. Diesel. You been lifting?
A little.

## Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
It's in your copy of Hemispheres. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes.

## How much is what?
The videos.

## Yes. Would you care for another one?
Yes.

## Where do you live?
Excuse me.

## I operate out of the Chicago O'Hare hub. Can I help you with anything else?
Where's Spa.

## How do you know it's not drugs?
Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.

## It means you got a gun?
I'm not saying shit to neither of you.

## What? Why am I bad?
See you later.

## You really in trouble?
Stop.

## So we just go eat with him and that's gonna solve everything?
Dude, you just gotta settle your shit down. You gotta go and say all that 'Red Dragon' shit. Make him think he's on Barretta.

## And where is...?
Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.

## No?
Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either.

## Sure. Anyplace in particular?
I hear the China Club is a laugh.

## What do you want?
A little Charlie, perhaps.

## Coke?
I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.

## No, really, mate?
Here...

## Brilliantly. Care for a pint?
No, thanks, man. We got to head out.

## Sorry about that. Where's your mate?
Couldn't make it. Here's the money.

## Motherfucker, we're handing you money. What the hell we gonna pull?
Yeah.

## You think this shit's funny, Ho?
Nah, man...

## You think it's funny, motherfucker?
Last thing I want is you with a gun.

## The Soho Grand?
Yeah.

## You're from LA, right?
Yeah.

## So you're our own private guy?
I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.

## I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is?
The 'job?' Alls I know is I'm taking you to the Soho Grand.

## A lot of Persians?
Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.

## Sure. You boys want anything?
Yeah, bring us four fernet.

## Nigger, please. Don't even order that artichoke shit. West side guineas. Forget the drinks, Leo. We gotta roll. What do I owe you?
We're square.

## dollars in c-notes, a numeric pager, a double-A battery, and a first class round-trip ticket to JFK.
You rode?

## We're going to New York?
Yes. You're going to New York.

## And the money. Where do we bring the money?
That money is your per diem.

## And where do we bring it?
Yeah.

## What about my keys?
Yes.

## You want... Why are you picking on me?
Because you lost my fucking carpet cleaning van and I don't like you.

## So, wait, what are we dropping off?
Goodbye.

## What, motherfucker? You drinking 'the witch' after dinner?
Yeah. That fernet tastes like tar. My grandfather tried to give me that.

## Maxie told you to keep your mouth shut while you're working, right?
What the fuck you think, I wanna 'hang' with you motherfuckers? Yeah you're working. And put down the champagne.

## Unless spoken to, ain't that right, Horrace. Didn't you say that?
No...

## Outfit? What's he talking about?
The Red Dragon.

## When all this is over and we're not working for Maxie, I'd love to run into you on the street. Why aren't you coming?
That's none of your fucking business.

## And here I thought you flew in some out of town muscle. How's it going, men?
So, you must be the Red Dragon.

## Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?
Edinburgh.

## And where might that be?
I'll get it.

## What they call you?
Red, and I ain't no punk.

## Heard where?
Where I come from. Boston.

## You ain't bullshitting me, is you, boy?
My papa taught me one thing, don't never bullshit a West Indian bullshit artist.

## Is your papa West Indian?
No, my mama. She's from Grenada.

## Where can I get a hold of you?
YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.

## Don't never write nothing down. File it up here, like I do. 'Cause if they can't find no paper they ain't got no proof. Ya dig?
Yes, sir.

## Did you just now con me?
Yes, sir.

## Why?
Cause I want in. And it don't take a lot to know you there, daddy.

## When?
Just now.

## What?
Frisk me, baby. Give me a real pat down.

## How's it feel?
Solid, daddy.

## Okay, baby. Now you outfitted. You ready to tackle the street?
Let 'em come. I'm ready.

## Ain't nuthin' in the world to give you that real deep cool. Like girl. You there?
I'm there, daddy. Wheww. I'm cool enough to kill.

## 1, 2, 8; 2, 8, 1. I git 'em all?
I'll take your goddam bet.

## What you talking?
You owe me six big ones.

## 1, 2, 8 hit, didn't it?
You din't have no 1, 2, 8.

## Shit, what else she gonna say?
Then skip it, man. But you slipping, baby. You done slipped.

## It's me or you, ain't it, Pops?
You know it.

## That really you, Red?
You saved my life, Archie. Running me out of Harlem. When I think how close we came to gunning each other down, I have to thank Allah.

## That's a fact. What you do, boy?
Yeah, got to do something about you.

## What you say?
He gave it to you, Archie. He did.

## Who the hell are you?
Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.

## Man, what do you want?
You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some.

## If you ain't trying to punk me, what's your hype?
I can show you how to get out of prison. And it's no hype.

## Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.

## What did you give it to me for then?
Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear me without it.

## Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! Why don't you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of being black?
I ain't said I'm ashamed.

## Elijah who?
Elijah Muhammad can get you out of prison. Out of the prison of your mind. Maybe all you want is another fix. I thought you were smart.

## What's he gonna do to me he ain't already done?
You the only cat don't come on with that \"Whatcha know, daddy\" jive; and you don't cuss none.

## What do you do with your time?
That's what Mama used to say.

## What the hell for, man?
Go on, fool; the marble shooters are waiting for you.

## That's bullshit. That's a white man's book. Ain't all these white man's books?
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.

## Man, how'm I gonna know the ones worth looking at?
Man, I'm studying in the man's book. I don't dig half the words.

## Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay in there with the wood.
Where am I gonna start?

## Lemme tell you about history, black history. You listening?
You pitch, baby; I'll ketch.

## I don't know what to say to Allah.
Who are you?

## Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?
Yeah. When I was picking a lock to rob somebody's house.

## Brother Bembry, can we fix it so our loudspeaker is heard on the street?
Mr. X, I was out there tonight. I saw what you did. I want to be a Muslim. I ain't never seen a Negro stand up to the police like that.

## Do you?
Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.

## Is the program ready?
No, Brother Minister.

## Has the Reverend called? Is he going to show?
She ate.

## Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why?
If you want to tell me.

## Considering today's standards of animal raising and curing meats, I don't fully understand the restriction on pork.
Shall I tell my sisters that we oppose marriage?

## Could we sit down someplace?
I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.

## What?
Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.

## How do you like it?
Delicious.

## They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?
You have enough worries of your own.

## Why do you ask?
Just an idle question.

## How old are you, Betty?
There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.

## Are you?
And dogged when I set my mind to something.

## What have you set your mind to?
Being a good Muslim, a good nurse and a good wife.

## At a gas station. Will you marry me?
Yes.

## Yes. Did you eat?
I love you.

## What do you think?
The simplest thing in the world, I want to have a lot of babies with you. Dear Heart, I love you.

## Why are you looking at me like that?
Because you're in trouble.

## How do you know?
I don't want to bring my troubles home. You know that.

## The talk is everywhere!
We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just talk any more.

## Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you?
I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.

## Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.

## Will they? Are you sure? Are you sure or are you blind?
Get some sleep.

## Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?
Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.

## I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
I don't think that's such a good idea.

## I called Sister Betty, she didn't tell you?
I assumed...

## Brother Minister, what is wrong?
Let's cancel.

## Is my family here yet?
Down front as always.

## Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus, son?
Preacher, take your tin Jesus and the Virgin Mary, both, and shove 'em.

## You've been talking about the disciples. What color were they?
I don't think we know for certain.

## They were Hebrew, weren't they?
That's right.

## What color were the original Hebrews?
I told you we don't know for certain.

## Just what are you saying?
I'm not saying anything, preacher. I'm proving to you that God is black.

## Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black supremacy? Why do you teach hate?
Stop me if I'm wrong. I \"polarize the community.\" I \"erroneously appraise the racial picture.\"

## Did you see the papers today?
Yes, sir, I did.

## Can I ask you something?
Sure, man.

## Do your job, Get me a bourbon on the rocks and a pack of Lucky's.
Are you Elijah's pimp?

## Mind your own goddamn business... She comes in a lot?
Bout every other night, Red.

## She know?
If she got eyes, she do.

## Is she hooking?
Not yet. But the way things going, that boy gonna turn her out any day.

## How many you turning out?
500.

## How long has this been going on?
All day since you and Betty left. Brother Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission. But I couldn't do it. I love y'all.

## What does Sidney say?
I'm with you, Brother Minister.

## ...That isn't a whore?
That's alright. Baby, take your time. Sophia's not going anywhere. I told you to walk, don't run.

## You like 'em scrambled soft or hard, sweetie?
C'mere.

## You hear me, girl?
You the man.

## Me?
You will, baby -- if the time come.

## Yeah and get a slave, too, huh, baby?
I ain't doing bad.

## Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?
I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.

## How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
Well, Sammy's dead. Yeah, fell over in the bed with a chick twenty years younger than him. Had twenty-five grand in his pocket.

## What can you do?
Then I put him to bed and pour talcum powder on him like a baby. He gets his jollies off.

## Might be all right.
So what about him?

## You want to be the head man?
That's right.

## Head nigger in charge?
I'm the man.

## Your turn, Rudy. You want me to flip for you?
Jesus Christ, no. Okay, okay. You got it, you got it! You're the boss.

## Who the hell are they?
Brothers of Brother Johnson.

## He told you that?
Yes sir.

## Are you sure?
Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.

## Believe it or not, you're safe here. The Judicial police will kill you. If they can. This page?
No.

## Am I a suspect?
No. It would be convenient, but no.

## It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?
Sit, Creasy. Everything that happens from now on does so with my permission. Really. You won't find a better carne asada in all of Mexico.

## The same thing as you. Except, my reach isn't as long as yours. My father was a policemen, did you know that?
I don't know shit about you.

## Are you going to arrest me or talk me to death?
So you are going to talk me to death.

## Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing.

## My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys were up to something. Are you two fucking?
No, but I have to admit I thought about it.

## You have no interest in making things easy, do you?
I'm not... easy.

## So what do I get in return?
Let's see how the relationship develops. I'll call you in the AM. Thanks.

## I need something. Do you have banking connections?
I have connections.

## Where do I find you?
I'll call you tomorrow.

## What do you know about the cop? Tazinari. The one who made the ransom drop with Samuel Ramos?
He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.

## Where does he live?
Give me the address.

## I show, you give me the information?
Deal.

## Who's he?
Yes.

## What is it?
Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.

## Is it loaded?
It's loaded.

## How does it affect you?
My coordination. Reaction time. If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay.

## I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?
No. And no one is to know of your drinking problem. That includes my wife.

## Creasy? Where the fuck are you?
I'm here.

## What do you mean, I'm here?
I'm in a Customs holding tank in Mexico City International. Bring a bunch of cash... about 5K. I'm going to need it.

## So what's wrong?
Nothing wrong.

## But don't you stay in El Paso?
Fuck, I love Mexico. I live like a king down here.

## You been working?
Not for eight months. I was in Columbia looking around, but, nothing seemed interesting.

## How long you staying, Crease?
Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse.

## You did something on impulse?
Everything happens once if you live long enough.

## You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
Well, you'd have to keep it under control.

## And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
You do your best. They won't be paying you enough to perform miracles.

## What are you doing here?
I came to visit you.

## A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
Oh, now you think I can be trusted.

## You mean a misfire?
I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.

## Creasy?
Sorry I woke you, Ray.

## Then one day, he calls and says, 'I'm in love and I'm moving to Mexico.' I said what happened to the plan?
I said the plan was right here.

## Yes or no?
I won't kill again. Hunt people. I gave that up. Anything else? It's yours.

## Cut the stock here. The barrel here. Make sure you file it smooth. Rocket launchers?
Different door. Not far from here.

## Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?
If they like me.

## That's 'Bird.' Emilio forgot to take him with when he left.
Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?

## Who's Emilio?
My last bodyguard. He drove me to school in the morning and picked me up in the afternoon.

## In between you can take Mom shopping and to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr. Creasy?
Creasy. Just call me Creasy.

## Where are you from, Creasy?
The United States.

## I know. But which state?
No.

## You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?
No.

## Why not?
I'm looking for potential.

## Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
Someone gave him more money than we could.

## Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
Time will tell.

## There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my fee or get a larger gun.

## Did you like school, Creasy?
No.

## Not at all?
No.

## Hmmm?
It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.

## So you were unhappy?
Being unhappy is a state of mind. I never thought about it.

## I go to school, don't I?
You're fast.

## What are you doing?
Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.

## Maybe. Did you hear him?
No.

## How do you think he got out?
Well, I let him go.

## It's better to be free, right?
Yes. Actually, he was driving me crazy.

## I don't think they're broken. Anywhere else?
My ankle.

## The night you arrived, Mom asked you if you had a family and you lied, didn't you?
White lie. I didn't have a family. But I did have two kids. They're adults now.

## Do you always sleep with him?
I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.

## Did you sleep alright?
Yes.

## How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
In a week you should be fine.

## Why do you ask?
It was in a book at school. Concubine.

## But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
In the West, it's one wife for one husband, but different cultures have different rules.

## So how come you know so much about those countries?
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.

## What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
No, that was in Columbia.

## Remember you asked me what state I was from?
Yes.

## Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy?
No.

## Did you used to?
Yeah. Two or three.

## Where's my mother?
I dropped her at home.

## It's no wonder you're late. Why didn't she just come with you?
I'm not afraid you, Creasy.

## Are you afraid of me?
The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.

## What's so important in Los Angeles?
Your father has business.

## Why today? And why'd she have to go with him?
The blocks.

## Could I stop you?
You don't drink like you used to.

## My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.

## You think too much?
Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough.

## Dyslexic?
You got that right.

## The world of our children. How dare they?
It's war. The weakest suffer the most.

## You've done much of this work before?
Never.

## How are you getting along with Pinta?
We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.

## Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
No.

## You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right?
Look. Maybe this isn't going to work. Maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone... more sociable.

## Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
Because... I was already dead.

## Planned what?
I don't believe you.

## What was her name?
Camila. Camila Valencias.

## Do you know what she told me last night?
Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be as beautiful as her mother one day.

## Yeah? And if she was ugly?
And Lisa will be able to save face. We won't be the only family without a bodyguard.

## When?
Samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard. It may take a few days, but you're going back.

## Yes, mom?
This is Mr. Creasy.

## You do?
He's like a great big bear. 'Creasy bear'...

## And bankruptcy. Where will that put me in the social strata?
I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.

## Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy?
I think it's nice he's American.

## Hmm?
Creasy. Pinta likes him.

## What? Who?
Creasy.

## What happened to him? What happened to Creasy?
None of your business. Or mine for that matter. I got nothing more to say.

## What was she to Creasy then?
Light. At the end of a long, dark tunnel. Somehow, she showed him it was alright to live again.

## You wanna have a drink before we start dancing?
Listen. You people go grab a table. I'll be back inna minute. I'll be right back.

## Which one was that?
That big girl that was sitting in front of us with the skinny friend.

## Well, let's call her up. What can we lose?
I didn't like her, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.

## What makes you say that?
I could see she likes you.

## My old lady, every word outta her mouth, when you gonna get married?
My mother, boy, she drives me crazy.

## Not a bad crowd tonight, you know?
There was one nice-looking one there inna black dress and beads, but she's dancing now.

## Where?
I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.

## What for?
We gotta whole pot inna kitchen. We give you a plate-a your own.

## Who you gonna call?
I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.

## Are you kidding?
You got me mad, that's why. Hey, Joe, show Marty that picture.

## I looked all over for you last night, you know that?
Marty, your mother wants you onna phone.

## Hello, Lou, Angie come in yet?
He was here last night till about two o'clock. I hear you really got stuck with a dog last night.

## Who told you that?
Angie. He says she was a real scrawny- looking thing.

## I came to see you. How you feel?
I gotta pain in my left side, and my leg throbs like a drum.

## Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, owned the tavern in Abruzzi?
I don't think I remember him.

## Who?
Well, I always like to visit you, Catherine, because you always got such cheerful news.

## Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
You told me.

## What happen?
She gave me the evil eye.

## Ah?
You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon...

## Who?
Your son Thomas and his wife Virginia...

## When was this?
This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.

## My son Thomas came to see you this afternoon, and he said to you he wants to cast his mother from his house?
So I am an old garbage bag, put inna street.

## Who?
Marty.

## Were the lights on?
Oh sure. This girl is a college graduate.

## You come up here often?
Yeah.

## I'm twenty-nine years old. How old are you?
I'm thirty-four.

## ...you teach chemistry? That's funny. Where? What school?
Benjamin Franklin High School.

## Wadda you think?
I think anything you want to do, you'll do well.

## Why don't you just move out to Portchester?
Well, that's what I was saying. My father is getting old. And we're very close. He's a wonderful man, really...

## Waddaya doing tomorrow night?
Nothing.

## Waddaya doing New Year's Eve?
Nothing.

## You got an elevator in this house?
We just live one flight up.

## Couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?
You mustn't feel too harshly against her daughter-in-law. She also wants to have a house to clean and a family to cook for.

## You don't think my sister Catherine should live in her daughter-in-law's house?
Well, I don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, I don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple.

## Where do you think a mother-in-law should go?
I don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.

## You say something?
Yeah. I was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.

## Are you kidding?
I'm just here with another girl.

## Where you going now?
I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I left them in my coat.

## WOMAN And that husband of hers is a skinny bit of a fellow, isn't he?
WOMAN Well, I bumped into her on the street, and she was as big as a barrel.

## WOMAN Oh, that's nice. So the doctor was wrong, wasn't he?
WOMAN Oh, no! She died right in the hospital...

## What time is it?
About eight o'clock.

## Sure, what?
All right, I'll see you, Thomas, because he wants an answer by Monday.

## Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas?
Sure, great if you ain't married.

## Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about?
No, I don't know. That's why I'm asking you.

## Marty, see that my mother is nice and comfortable, eh?
Sure. This girl said...

## So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I may just hang arounna house.

## What?
I say, why don't you go to the Stardust Ballroom? It's loaded with tomatoes.

## It's loaded with what?
Tomatoes.

## How'd you come home, Ma? Thomas give you a ride?
Oh, it's a sad business. My sister, Catherine, she don't get along with her daughter-in-law, so she's gonna come live with us.

## Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma?
Oh, sure. Siddown, siddown. Marty, tell her siddown.

## Did you offer the young lady some fruit?
I offered her, Ma, she don't want nothing.

## She looks a little old for you. About thirty-five, forty years old?
She's twenty-nine, Ma.

## What, Ma?
She looks thirty-five, forty. She didn't look Italian to me.

## I said, is she Italian girl?
I don't know. I don't think so.

## What didn't you like about her?
I don't know! She don't look like Italian to me. Plenny a nice Italian girls around.

## So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I think I'll just hang arounna house and watch...

## You want a beer, Ang'?
I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty...

## Waddaya read there, Joe?
So, Marty, let me tell you about these nurses...

## What nurses?
The nurses Leo and me picked up last night. We got a date with them tonight.

## Waddaya mean, Ralph?
Hey, Louise, I want you to meet Marty Pilletti. Marty, that's Louise Kelly, inna back seat there.

## Your kid brother got married last Sunday, eh, Marty?
That's right, Missus Fusari. It was a very nice affair.

## I thought he was a big tall fat fellow. Didn't I meet him here one time? Big tall, fat fellow, he tried to sell me life insurance?
Well...

## My son Frank, he was married when he was nineteen years old. Watsa matter with you?
That's swell, Missus Fusari.

## Don't worry. I'm gonna take care-a the whole thing.
Well, I don't know. He sits arounna house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a bride?

## Ma, you want something to eat, some tuna fish?
Hey, why don't you go to the movie? Your mother and me, we're gonna be baby-sitter.

## Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?
Ah, my mother, she drives me crazy. I hadda beg her to let me drive her over here. The martyr. She always gotta be the big martyr.

## How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?
Tommy, I promised the babysitter six o'clock.

## Don't you think I feel lousy about this too?
Tommy...

## We wanted to tell you how you were helping us with your fixes.
I don't wanna hear anymore about it, you hear me?

## You talked to Walt?
He's parted his moorings.

## What do you want me to do?
I don't think I can give absolution to a man who's about to commit suicide. It's a mortal sin.

## What is, Red, the intention or the act?
I believe it takes both. I'd have to look it up.

## Nice looking kid. Going to be okay?
He'll live if that's what you mean. But somebody better be around when he comes to and finds out there's nothing left between his legs.

## Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
Reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.

## How you, Radar?
You boys'll have to go to work early.

## What are you going to do with him?
Well... I was going to name you Chief Surgeon... To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's.

## I mean, what were you doing? Were you a resident or on a staff someplace?
That's right.

## Where?
Hospital.

## Which hospital?
Back home.

## Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
No. Or why you should.

## Don't you use olives?
Where you think you are, boy? They probably never seen a olive in this country.

## I don't know what else. You've been that route a little, haven't you?
Not enough to be a pro.

## Okay, I'm a witness, but how do you prove who's right?
There's only one way.

## You really think we hurt him that bad?
Hell, no, all you did was knock the wind out of him. But he won't be playing any more football today.

## I have great interest for America, his peoples and his custom.
Because is not democrash? All peoples created equal?

## Good, because we got a fine old American custom we want to teach you. You know what these are?
I don't think I should have opened my big mouth. Sorry, Ho-Jon.

## You  must  open  me  up  again?
This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy. Our houseboy. I'm teaching him English.

## But first will you please kindly shut the goddam door?
I don't drink intoxicants.

## The door, Frank, the door! Where you from anyhow, Alaska?
Wisconsin.

## What?
We got to stop them right here.

## You mind if we get out of this guy's brain first?
What's there to do? You found the sliver.

## You got directions?
Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.

## Make it yourself, or is it real?
Tax-free booze. It's about all you can say for army life.

## Where you from with that crazy way of talking?
Crabapple Cove. Maine.

## Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
We got to head them off, right at the start. Push them around first.

## Must be the Famous Curb Service Whore  House. You in the market Duke?
I done my shopping in Seoul last night.

## What do you think of that piece of scenery, Yankee boy?
Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.

## Nothing can't wait. Shall we check it out with the Major?
Now that's what I call real pretty. We can close up here and go into his belly.

## What's that?
The chest-cutter.

## Jesus to Jesus and eight hands around! Duke, did I ever tell you how I beat Dartmouth by intercepting a pass?
Sixteen times.

## Best equipped dentist in the whole goddam Army. Care to have a look, a man with your background?
Way we hear it, the Pride is supposed to have run up the highest lifetime batting average ever recorded in Wayne County.

## And you've had a natural four times in a row in a crap game. Right? Does that mean...?
Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice. It's a different ritual but it works the same.

## What do you think, Trapper?
Y'all just act natural.

## Good thinking, Duke. How about it, Ho-Jon? Can you round up a few of the boys?
Never mind. Forget it.

## What's he got to write, for God's sake?
An application to Androscoggin College.

## How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.

## Where the hell we going to get us a football team?
All three of us played for our schools. And there are at least four other guys...

## How come nobody knows about him? And you do?
Any time. Whenever we want.

## Screw it. We been earning our keep as respectable knife artists. Why should we do work any pill-rolling punk could handle?
Hell, man, that don't matter. We're loaded. We were big wheels in the black market in Seoul.

## Ravenous. What about you?
Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...

## Finest kind. We're training Ho-Jon to be a bartender. Join us?
Give us this day our daily...

## You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
...trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against...

## Come clean with us, Frank. Were you on this religious kick back home, or did you start to crack up here on the post?
...And for our Supreme Commander over here and our Commander-in-Chief in Washington.

## But what about Major Houlihan?
Damn right. Three to one, as much as you want to put up.

## What?
Pierce! That soldier requires immediate attention. I'm a surgeon and I know.

## Now, General, I'm going to sandbag you. Do you think we're ready to get out of this belly?
Obviously you don't think so, and I don't know why.

## I only wanted to know what she's like in the sack. Do those big boobs hold up or are they kind of droopy?
Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.

## What for?
SERGEANT We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.

## SERGEANT C-A-M-E-M...?
B-E-R-T, right. See you tomorrow.

## If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?
That's the front up the road a few miles. We have to get by without some of the comforts of home.

## What are they peeking at? Captain Waldowski in the shower?
Part of him. Painless is the owner and operator of the Pride of Hamtrack. That's where he comes from... Hamtrack, Michigan.

## But weren't you supposed to meet the surgeons who are going to slice up the Congressman's son?
But besides the operation, we've got to get in at least eighteen holes of golf.

## Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?
And if it isn't, why don't we call Washington on your telephone? You tell your story, we'll tell ours.

## Is he out?
Like the Rock of Gibraltar.

## Okay, but I'll need you to help. Duke, will you take that belly back there? The Australian?
It's in pretty deep.

## What do we do?
We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.

## It's five minutes into nurses' shower hour. Where are they?
They're coming.

## So what makes you think he'll play for us?
We'll cut him in on the bets we make. And still have enough profit to send Ho-Jon to college.

## Honey, nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?
Captain, I've been observing the nurses on your shift. But naturally your own opinion is more informed than mine.

## All of them?
That's right. We work well together.

## Listen, we look pretty lousy out there, right?
Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years...

## What's the matter?
We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes.

## How did you get called that?
The Last of the Mohicans.' Only book my father ever read.

## It isn't always this rough?
Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.

## Our minds?
For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...

## And absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband. Do we have that in common, Captain?
It's a matter of definition. Faithful in spirit, yes.

## Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
But you've made me feel strong again, Captain. Hawkeye. You helped me pull together when I needed it.

## You're leaving tomorrow?
In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.

## You're on his side all of the sudden?
A man would be more considerate. He wouldn't come home to his wife a nervous wreck.

## How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?
It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.

## You're asking for somebody else?
It happens to be a matter of life and death.

## A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
He should come to now for a while, but he's got so much dope in him by tomorrow he won't know fact from fantasy.

## Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.

## Two-man job. How much blood has he had?
Second pint.

## What do you want with those two medical officers?
They missed the boat.

## The real Trapper John? The one who threw you the famous pass and went to greater glory on the Boston and Maine Railroad?
The one and only.

## Why can't you look at him?
I have but well, you know, I've been mainly an anesthetist a long time now and... well, I'd like you guys to take a look at him.

## What's the story?
Well, one of the girls got careless and two days ago she gave birth to an eight-pound American-Japanese male.

## What's wrong with him?
Every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.

## If a man isn't a man anymore, what's he got left to live for?
Tell me the whole story, Walt.

## Painless, you mustn't talk that way. It's a lot of crap. Cover for what?
Homosexuality.

## You've been drawn to other males? Since you were a kid?
No, never in the slightest.

## Just in dreams?
Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.

## That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
No, one thing I finally know for sure, I'll never function with a woman again.

## Morning Painless. How they goin'?
Big day. Two jaws to rebuild.

## Hi, Ho-Jon. How they goin'?
Finest kind. Captain Forrests say you better haul ass home quick. We got new chest-cutter in our tent.

## Pain bad, Ho-Jon?
I  wouldn't  wish  it  on  a  maneating  shark.

## I'm Colonel Blake. You fellows just passing through?
Nope, we're assigned heah.

## Your tent?
We'll find out what they are when you throw us out.

## That's all the commitment you're offering me? Or do you have some more extravagant gesture of cooperation?
You work those kind of hours, you got to have rest. Which you can't get with somebody jabbering away on a direct line to heaven.

## Fifteenth straight day there've been six o'clock choppers. How long can a battle go on?
You got to relax, Henry. Since the deluge started, you been working in the OR and running the outfit, too.

## You mean who hit who?
Yes, that's what I mean.

## What's wrong with you?
Dammit, Radar, wait till I call you! Tell Major Burns...

## One of the surgeons from the day shift will have to stay on duty tonight?
Yes, dammit, and...

## O'Reilly, what is it? There aren't more choppers coming?
I'm afraid so, Colonel.

## Sir?
Don't do that, Radar! You make me nervous.

## Sir?
Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...

## Morning, Radar. How were things?
Splendid, sir. No problems.

## Can you make out what they're talking about?
I can try, sir.

## Thank you, Spearchucker. I'll certainly take a look at these. Where the hell did you ever get that name?
I used to throw the javelin.

## What's that, Henry?
I out-coached that General Hammond.

## Yeah?
It's an American boy's rupture you're supposed to close.

## Planes mostly. May take a crack at rickshaws. How does the direct approach work over here?
I been out of action since I got over here five months ago.

## That bad? But I guess you're right. We might as well see him. Got any caddie carts?
Never mind.

## Soup? Rice? What are we doing, beginning all over again?
No, we had a clear soup to start. This is a thick one and you ought to taste it. There's nothing like it back home.

## Now?
But it's ten-thirty at night. We can't get military personnel out for a civilian. A foreign civilian.

## How is he?
Nice.

## Ease off on those tapes, and let's see how much it bleeds. How is he?
Yeah, maybe.

## Would you be willing to say you wrote that letterand stick by it?
Oh, I get the idea. Yeah, maybe.

## Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.

## Action?
Um-hum.

## With all of it?
Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.

## Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
Oh, crabby guy, huh?

## Against what?
Against anything. Just protest.

## Now, look, John. Here's the speech. It's in caps and double-spaced. You won't have any trouble reading it. Not nervous, are you?
No.

## Who?
John Doe. The one in there.

## Who?
Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.

## Look, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it?
Uh-huh ...

## Me?
Uh-huh.

## Can I help you pack?
No, thank you.

## Do you care if I sit down out here?
No.

## About me?
Sure was crazy. I dreamt I was your father.

## Well, would you like to know who it was you were marrying?
Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.

## I guess so. Then what happened?
Well, I took you across my knee and I started spanking you.

## How many people do you think we've talked to already, outside the radio, I mean?
I don't know. About three hundred thousand.

## Did you write this?
Yes, I did, John. But II had no idea what was going on.

## ... Er, this John Doe idea is yours, huh?
Yes, sir.

## How much money do you get?
Thirty dollars.

## Thirty dollars? Well, er, what are you after? I mean, what do you want? A journalistic career?
Money.

## Money? Well, I'm glad to hear somebody admit it. Do you suppose you could write a radio speech that would put that fellow over?
Oh, I'm sure I can.

## Oh, somebody else sitting there?
No, no, nothat's your seat.

## A third party?
Huh? Oh, yes. Let's go. Now, let's see. We want some action in these pictures.

## Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.

## What?
Oh, yes, Father certainly would.

## Huh?
The letter.

## What letter?
The letter from John Doe.

## Very pretty. Very pretty, indeed, Miss Mitchell. But would you mind telling me who goes on Christmas Eve?
John Doe.

## The one we hire for the job, you lunkhead!
Well, you're catching on.

## Plus a bonus.
Who, for instance?

## Sorry.
What bonus?

## So you think this is worth a thousand dollars, do you?
Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.

## We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel roomunder bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him. Did you speak to Mr. Norton?
Thinks it's terrific. Says for us to go the limit. Wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state.

## Yes. What's he doing here?
Friend of his. They play duets together.

## I got it all ready. Here.
Duets? But can we trust him?

## No, you've got yourself a meal ticket and you hate to let go.
If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me.

## Thank you.
What's the idea?

## How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.

## Has he been here?
No.

## Have you seen him?
I ain't seen him for a week.

## Where's Connell?
Yeah, a little.

## What do you do when you work?
I used to pitch.

## Baseball?
Uh-huh. Till my wing went bad.

## Where'd you play?
Bush leagues mostly. Med. shot, To include the rest of them. They have their eyes glued on his face. ANN is very much interested.

## Sure. Hey, but the biggest thing I didn't tell you ...
Where is she?

## Hello! ... Yeh?
just called the morgue, boss. They say there's a girl there

## What do they want?
They all say they wrote the John Doe letter.

## Yeah, Boss?
Take charge of him. Get him a suite at the Imperial and hire some bodyguards.

## Both of 'em?
Yes, both of 'em! But don't let him out of your sight.

## Oh, quiet, quiet, quiet. Say, tell me something did you read that speech you're gonna make tonight?
And when they get you, you got no more chance than a road-rabbit.

## Listen, sucker, yuh ever been broke?
Sure. Mostly often.

## Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.
Ba-ll!

## Grubbel's here. See?
Just like you said on the radio, Mr. Doe.

## How could he be a fake?
It must be some kind of a gag.

## Sure, sure. I'd like to believe in fairy tales, but a guy that's fake isn't gonna jump off any roof.
A what?

## Hey, pretty nifty, huh?
You ain't gonna get me to stay here.

## Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?
Four bits.

## Better make it doughnuts, huh?
Yeh.

## John Doe Club?
I trust him.

## Oh, you trust him, eh? Well, that's fine. I suppose he trusts you, too?
Yeah, but it's got to be by Bone- Setter Brown.

## Now, that's all right, isn't it?
You betcha.

## Yeah. It certainly is.
Yeah, you bet!

## And you'd feel like an awful sucker if you found yourself marching right in the middle of it, wouldn't you?
You must be wrong, Mr. Connell, 'cause he's been marvelous about the John Doe Clubs.

## Yeah? Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
Sure. I don't blame you. So am I.

## Huh? Get what?
Look, D. B. I'm supposed to know my way around. This John Doe movement costs you a fortune. This convention's gonna cost plenty.

## I see. I'd better stick to running the paper, huh?
Yes. Sure.

## Show me an American who can keep his mouth shut andI'll eat him.
How?

## Did you write that letter to Miss Mitchell?
No, I didn't.

## What are you doing up here then?
Well, the paper said there were some jobs around loose. Thought there might be one left over.

## How about family? Got any family?
No.

## Oh, just traveling through, huh?
Yeah. Me and a friend of mine. He's outside.

## What's your name?
Willoughby. John Willoughby, Long John Willoughby they called me in baseball.

## That's a lie! Listendon't believe what he says ...
Is there anything wrong?

## I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
Let go of me! This man had no intention of jumping off of the top of a building! He was paid to say so! Do you deny that?

## She isn't?
No, she just left. I'm surprised you didn't run into her. She went over to Mr. Norton's house.

## Oh, yeah. That's what I mean. See? It was easy as all that, huh?
Well, I was thinking thatYeah, you know, sort of break the ice.

## What do you mean, too bad?
Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again.

## Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm fixed?
Well, that's a cinch. I know somebody that'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth.

## Say, who's putting up this dough?
Feller runs the Chronicle . Here's the speech you makeand it's all written out for you.

## Have you got the speech I gave you?
Yeah.

## Is there a crowd in the street?
No, sir.

## A sea-gull? What's a sea-gull doing around the city hall? That's a bad omen, isn't it?
Oh, n-no, sir. The sea-gull is a lovely bird.

## What's the rush? They haven't killed anybody yet this week?
No -- you can't do that.

## Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
Come on. Just get in. We gotta go.

## You want me to go up with you?
Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.

## What's the line?
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.

## Who is it?
It's Lieutenant Sam Baffert from the San Francisco Police Department.

## What happened? Is there a problem?
May I come in? I would just like to ask you a couple of questions.

## Where did you find an old recording like that?
Used record shop down on Turk Street. I was in there looking for some Robert Johnson. Memories... Memory Lane or something...

## Could I please have a little water?
Of course.

## This cousin of yours... What's his name?
Clarence Teal.

## Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail?
I won't get away with it.

## Whoa!... The government. They control everybody's mind. You're too fucking stupid to know that?
This has nothing to do with Walter.

## How can I help you with the particles?
They have less power over you if you look into my eyes.

## Huh?
Tell my dad.

## Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.

## Where's the car?
Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals.

## Am I gettin' the car?
Automatic.

## 2 Johnny who?
2 Hold on a second here.

## Is there a problem?
2 You signed out twice.

## I what?
2 Look, why don't you just come on back inside for a second.

## Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
...a car.

## What's the suspect's name?
Earl.

## Anything on Korda so far?
Solis said to keep you clear of this.

## Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
Being faxed over now.

## Are you in charge, Roper?
Yep.

## Is that all?
For now that's all.

## What if you and me got into a struggle... and my gun went off?
Open the bag, dump everything on the table.

## I'm impressed. I didn't think you could do it. What did you have to do, steal them?
Yeah.

## Don't go reading my lips, man. That's an intrusion. Save that shit for the sniper school. Comprende?
Sorry... Habit.

## We're already past it, aren't we, Kevin?
If you say so.

## You ever been in a hostage situation?
Only at the very end.

## What's the point of this?
A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.

## So, McCall, how come you ended up in San Francisco?
They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.

## Recruited you from where?
National Marksman Competition.

## With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
Furthest point I could find from New York.

## You don't like New York?
Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while.

## You'd never been out of New York?
Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.

## How did you like Toronto?
It was okay.

## You caught me on an \"up\" day. How about you? How did you end up in San Francisco?
I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was. So you're looking for \"fast advancement\".

## Is there something wrong with that?
I'm not sure.

## How are we gonna get him out of there?
We could fill it with water.

## You wouldn't want to put a small wager on this, would you?
I don't gamble.

## You living together?
She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.

## She grow up in Livingtston, too?
No, no, no... She's from Hoboken.

## Oh, \"city girl\". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
We see each other every couple of months.

## Every couple of months, huh?
That's a lot of commitment. I admire that.

## Do you really?
No. Actually I think it's fucking crazy, I don't know if I could do it.

## Where did you hear that?
Around. Barnett's tough competition.

## You think you can learn, McCall?
I think so.

## What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie.

## You know the ten commandments?
Yes.

## What's the first commandment?
Thou shall have no other God before me.

## Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
Yes.

## Why?
To save lives.

## So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives?
My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.

## You're a compulsive gambler?
I have two words for you... Seek help.

## Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
So what do you want?... An autograph.

## He'll be running at the quarter pole.
To run last?

## They need to run first and second?
Yeah, first and second.

## How much you wanna bet?
You want to bet on whether you won your bet? This is getting sick.

## How long you been coming here?
About six years. My partner took me.

## Is it always like this?
Occasionally you lose.

## Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.

## How many have you lost?
I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.

## And what about the ones you don't save?
You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.

## And what if you can't live with it?
You've got to decide that for yourself.

## So what do you want to do?
That's a chance I gotta take.

## McCall, you all right?
I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...

## Have you evacuated anyone?
Only that floor.

## Is the hostage injured?
Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.

## Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why?
I ain't interested in your life story.

## Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.

## Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?
My name's Scott Roper.

## A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep. Jack Daniels?
I'm not drunk. Yet.

## That a new picture?
About 4 months old. I'm working in a new style.

## I've proved that, didn't I?
Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.

## What do you want from me?
Something I guess I can't have anymore.

## You think I didn't need you?
If you did, you never showed it.

## You got a bet on the game tonight?
As a matter of fact, I do.

## That kind with the garlic and the oil that I like so much?
No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.

## What do you think?
Mmm, needs a little something.

## What about Greg? What are you gonna tell him?
It's okay. We broke up.

## When?
Just now.

## How's Paco doing?
He was going nuts at the park. He met this very attractive poodle. They made plans to meet again next weekend.

## You like this place?
It's very nice.

## There is?
For the last week things have been going pretty well between us. I think we've been doing a good job getting intimate and all that stuff...

## Yeah?
...Let me just show you.

## Hmm?
I've been thinking.

## Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?
Yeah.

## A deeper level?
That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it...

## I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.

## Depends. What's up?
There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.

## What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it?
Your concern is heartwarming.

## Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
His name's Kevin McCall. Every Metro Captain agrees that he's their top sharp-shooter and most likely to succeed.

## What do you think would be in order?
Like ahh... I don't know... Five thousand dollars.

## What happened to your Trans Am?
Repoed this morning.

## Who's running it?
Roper...

## What do we got?
32 minutes ago the silent alarm went off, then the fire alarm. A unit was a block away, and the suspect got trapped inside.

## What have you promised them?
Just that I'd talk to my superiors.

## Are these yours?
Yeah, they are but...

## What do you want?
I have found in life that what one wants isn't nearly as important as what one needs.

## What do you need?
I need to take back what's mine.

## Why?
To live forever.

## How come I can't remember?
Because I took it out of your memory.

## I'm serious, how did you know my name?
You were right.

## Someone who believes in miracles.
About what?

## You don't have much sex up there in the real world, do you?
No...

## Guests?
Just like you always wanted.

## What's happening?
Nothing, go back to sleep.

## True. But why?
Halden sent men to kill me in my sleep, but simple illusions won out. So he now sends the legend to finish the deed.

## Then what?
Yes.

## Not real?
You were the one who was dying.

## Where the hell are you going?
Unfinished business.

## And what about the reconfiguration?
Perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate your continued worth.

## You sure he's going to come?
It's his nature.

## How long 'till we can eject?
We're going to have to reconfigure.

## How long?
At least a day.

## What about the customers with reservations?
Have the staff apologize profusely and issue credit vouchers. But remember, it's a capacity problem. That's all.

## Where you plugged-in from?
New York.

## What?
The weather.

## Who?
The woman you're stuck on.

## Doesn't make sense. How the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys?
Sorry, I just design the maze. Keeping the keys secure is your job.

## What?
The truth.

## What is it?
The Terrace. First building Christoph ever programmed for us.

## A hotel?
It's not used for anything.

## Why?
He wouldn't say.

## Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
Good question.

## What did he tell you?
The truth.

## Why would I do that?
To hide the evidence.

## Then where is she?
Come on Tanner, think this through.

## Where?
Times Square.

## Insurance?
If she's alive, you get it back.

## What brings you inside?
Cleaning up a mess.

## Some things never change, do they?
I've got to get back.

## Someone you have to get back to?
No.

## You went to my high-school?
No.

## What are you talking about?
Night City.

## Her?
You said we were on the same programming team.

## Why?
It was a test.

## For what?
To see how long it would take for me to realize.

## Realize?
You weren't real.

## What?
Way you kiss me.

## What's the difference?
I'm sorry.

## Care to tell us how you came into possession of an illegal access program?
Look, I'm doing mute 'till I have a mouthpiece here who's on my side.

## What's so funny?
This. No point to it.

## Why not?
Because you'll never believe me.

## There?
My uni-net account. I log on. The program's there.

## Activated.
Just like that?

## Program name?
Resurrection.

## Destination?
Male.

## Program name?
... Perhaps there is a way... I have heard tales of another power.

## How can we reach Phaedos?
Rangers... I'm afraid you're too late.

## So how can we get to it?
The only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being...

## Now tell me... what do you see?
... Let's take a look over there.

## Where did it originate?
I see... a fox

## What's a Triac?
I think so.

## It's... an eagle?
Look closer.

## ... A falcon?
Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky.

## And how do we release the power?
I'm outta here.

## You want me to place a few calls?
\"Basically\".

## We couldn't have done it better ourselves.
What do you mean \"basically\"?

## Sir, we do not use such names at our hotel.
Anybody see them?

## When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
You own a hotel, sir?

## What are ya tellin' me, Charlie?
We're asking you to go to prison.

## Sure. What's with the brick wall?
Since Colosimo bit it, I gotta keep an eye out for his friends.

## Tell me something, Meyer. How can you get up at dawn to walk on the beach if you're on your honeymoon?
The commission don't decide how I spend my honeymoon.

## Why should you be payin' me when we're all equals?
You scare me, Charlie.

## Why should I be?
I had everything. Once.

## So what happened?
Life knocked me back.

## What do you mean?
Scared.

## When the stiff's an Irish, the cops take it kinda personal.
Could we step outside?

## Can't we get a couple whores over?
Four-twenty-eight.

## What's that divided four ways?
Tommy Reina. Good pal. Better partner.

## Shane was a friend of yours?
He was around...

## When you're investigatin', how long ya keep at it?
It consoles the bereaved family ta see the perpetrator take his load of juice. We try to oblige.

## You got men on Profaci's place?
We got our boys paintin' the house next door. Around the clock. We're gonna keep old man Profaci alive if it takes twenty coats.

## How's Bugsy doin'?
Tommy Reina's hauntin' his dreams. But he'll do his job.

## Who hired the bastard?
Maranzano. Ta ice you.

## How much longer we gotta be shut up in this fuckin' sweatbox?
Long as Charlie says.

## Where'd ya get this funny ravioli?
Ya ignorant Guinea, it's kreplach.

## Why ya always gotta go lookin' for a gift in the mouth of the horse?
A hundred-seven bucks too much. Any kid who drops an extra dime is gonna be talkin' to Moliari.

## Ya mean we're so rich we're broke?
Well...

## For being a bootlegger?
For being a man.

## You here with Bobby?
No. I'm here with you.

## What's the matter?
I must be going.

## For what?
Luciano.

## Why do you bother with perfume when you smell like this?
It's a mask.

## You got something to hide?
It's too late.

## Have you thought about this?
Why? You're the innocent one.

## So you all make the same mistakes?
Gives us something in common.

## London?
My friends have a country house we can use for a while.

## Would it be painful for you?
It always is.

## As long as ya got one top Boss, somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off. And that's war on top of war.
Charlie?

## Who'll make the rules?
We'll make 'em, and we'll enforce 'em. All of us. Together. We all get one vote. Includin' me.

## You fellas got names?
Lansky. Meyer Lansky. And that's Bugsy Siegel ya got there.

## So what is the problem?
The minute we sell out to Maranzano, that bastard is gonna have you knocked off.

## Married? To Anna? You ain't got her in trouble?
No. We ain't even...

## How soon can we pull this off?
I'm gettin' married in six weeks. I'll already be in Atlantic City which is probably the best place to do it anyway.

## Your honeymoon, Meyer?
Might as well put the time to use.

## Who?
Tommy Reina.

## Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
Seein' he loved the experience so much, I think we outta give him the pleasure again.

## Yeah. So who the fuck does?
Come on. Tell us, Shitface.

## Whatta ya mean, Boss?
Ya piss like a man.

## You boys carryin' pieces?
You tryin' ta tell me something? I don't come to a meet with a weapon unless it's with an enemy.

## What the fuck does that mean?
You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano.

## Wassa matter, Mr. Big Shot. Don't have time for my business no more?
Boss, I got all the time you need.

## How can I trust you when you look at me like that?
You got no fuckin' choice. You might be able to stay alive, but you're never gonna win the war from these fuckin' rat holes.

## What are ya thinkin'?
Joe Profaci. Carlo Gambino. Vinnie Mangano. Joe Bananas. They all gotta die.

## Shit. When I was comin' up, bein' fat meant ya had somethin' ta eat. Guy looked like you, people felt sorry for 'em. Right, Gerardo?
Sure. But ya got a deck a cards? I wanna play some Klob.

## And how many soldiers do you have?
I've got friends.

## Sittin' around gives me the piles. You got a proposition?
We combine everything. You are my second in command.

## And the Jews?
Share with them as you wish. Do business with them on your own. But no filthy Jew will ever be a brother to me.

## What makes you think I give a damn about that Sicilian crap?
Tell it to the Calabrian. Tell it to the Jews.

## Why didn't you tell me that Maranzano had made you an offer?
I turned him down flat.

## And what do you want out of this?
A peaceful and prosperous retirement.

## Wanna know what I think?
Spare us.

## Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
There won't be any way to stay out of it.

## Where's the stiff?
If it comes to that. Yeah.

## Yes?
COLL I'm comin' for my twenty thousand.

## Luciano is dead?
COLL Open a window. Every newsboy in town's screamin' about it.

## That a Jew compliment?
Best we got.

## Special occasion?
I don't know. I guess it was...

## Who did this?
Stu. That was right about the time we met.

## When he first came in to the sleep lab?
Yeah...before your time.

## How do you get from here?
Switch hands.

## Monkeybone?
Left-handed, he was funny And then the nightmares just...stopped.

## What's the maximum safe dose?
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.

## I beg your pardon?
I didn't say anything.

## Why?
I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.

## I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go?
Fine, thanks. Saw my girl, said goodbye, everything's gonna be okay.  I guess I'm yours now.

## Hey. Where's Monkeybone?
Back in your head, where he belongs.  No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.

## Back? You're sending me back?
It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the \"Family Circus\" guy instead.

## Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.

## But these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right?
At the moment, yes.

## Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...

## I think it's a pig hair.  How much is McDonald's offering?
Less.

## How much?
Well, nothing. It's a benefit. But we could probably get People to cover it.

## You're really gonna pop the question?
I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.

## Herb. I have to go.
Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?

## Why?
I got the ring.  Tonight's the night, Herb. Tonight's the night.

## Oh my God...you're proposing?
...In some weird way I respect that.

## He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop.  Anybody here know what Oneirix is?
No. I want to give him more. I want to give him a massive dose.

## Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me die.
What'll it do if they pull the plug?

## Uh huh. And?
Well, I have to get a message to her. I have to let her know I'm okay. Until I can get out of here...

## I think I...I'm about to... Am I mistaken, or don't I get to... Is there some...
Kid - didn't they tell you about this party?

## Y'see, Stu, as I understand it, you made this pact with your sister...no life support?
Besides, Julie wouldn't...she'd never...

## You're Death's brother?
Guys, I don't mean to be rude, but I only have eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to...

## Land of Death. How do I get there?
The monkey, of course. It was his idea.

## Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back.
You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw really scary cartoons?

## Home sweet home, huh? Actually, I was expecting something a little swankier. How much loot does old Stu rake in, anyway?
Meaning me, of course. I'm referring to myself. You have to assume Monkeybone would be a pretty lucrative franchise...

## Sure. Why?
You're acting kind of...odd.

## What are you watching?
Ohhh, nothing.

## You sure this is...medically advisable?
They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.

## Stu? Is that you? Where did you go?
Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.

## It looks so...new.
You're wearing a topcoat, Stu. - Where are your pants?

## It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...

## That was especially I have something I have to give you.
Heirloom? Huh? You want a used ring - ?

## Can't you give it to me later?
I might wake up.

## Did we just - hit something?
I don't think so.

## Are you okay?
I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.

## Stu?
Julie?... Hey, you are a looker.

## What's the matter?
My tail itches.

## An hour ago. . I can't even bear to look at him... How about you? You're okay?
I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine.

## Kimmy! What's the matter?
This is hard for me, Julie...very hard...but it's been three months now, and...  I gave the order.

## Hypnos?
Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.

## Listen to me! Is there any way I can warn her what Monkeybone is up to?
Don't ask where I got it.

## How am I gonna get past the guards?
I'll OKAY, STU. SEE YOU IN A DAY OR TWO.

## I've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what's his name?
My Fellow Americans. I have a dream. Let us boldly go where no man has gone before.

## Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey.
I'm sorry, Kitty - what were you saying?

## He?
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.

## How'd you get in there?
Stu... It's a party.

## Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real, boss, but I gotta go buff up my resum. ANYBODY HERE NEED A FIGMENT?
Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.

## Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?
No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.

## Where'd he go?
You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've made it without you.

## What happened? Did you lose your keys?
Have a nice day.

## My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe. Is that true?
We like to think so, yeah.

## Who told you we deal drugs?
I'm just concerned about my daughter.

## What about yesterday? Kicking that poor boy?
That poor boy's a crack dealer from Alphabet City. We do not allow his kind on this block.

## Is there something else I can do for you?
Well, I'd love to see inside your club.

## You want to come inside?
Well, if you're not holding a meeting or anything.

## So, what do you think?
Well, once you're inside, it's nice.

## That's New York. It looks rundown, but it's safe during the day. You'll get used to it.
You don't like where I live?

## ... What are they all doing there?
That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters.

## The motorcycle gang? Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
I just can't seem to focus on anything these days.

## How are you doing sweetheart?
I'm good.

## Dating anyone?
No, I'm working too much, I don't have time.

## Mother, I ...
What about the fellow in those pictures?

## Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking?
Oh, that has nothing to do with it.

## No, I had a dream about daddy. Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
Oh, I hope so, dear.

## Aaron?
Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.

## It's unusually quiet tonight, isn't it?
Mm hmm.

## Here you go. I think you should talk to Dr. Byrne when you get back about how much Valium he's prescribing. Okay?
At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better.

## I love you, Mom. I have to run. You remembered to call the limousine service, right?
Mm hmm.

## It's Marika. Is Paula there?
She's at work. I'm her mother.

## Really?
Oh, it was such a big scandal.

## What happened?
Poor man had to leave town. And I hear that other women came forward.

## What does he do?
He's an organic farmer.

## What do you think? I left it on the curb?
I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous. It's my first time in New York. Just a minute.

## So, you come here all by yourself?
Uh, yes. My husband passed away recently ...

## I'm from South Dakota. Where are you from?
Moscow.

## Ohhh. Do you know the East Village?
Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.

## You mean it's dangerous?
Nah, not dangerous. Not that dangerous. Not during the day.

## This way?
Yeah. Not far. You will be fine. It's still day.

## I see. How much?
Forty-five all total.

## Forty-five? I thought it was only supposed to be thirty?
Thirty is base price. Tolls, tax, tip ... it all adds up.

## Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen. What's this?
Calendar for the day. You'll find the Senate Manual in the drawer. Anything else you want, just snap for a page.

## Where's the Majority Leader?
The Majority Leader? Right over there. And that's  the Minority Leader. They're both pretty good in the clinches.

## Uh-huh. And where's the Press Galery?
Thanks very much, sonny--

## But it *isn't*?
It couldn't be.

## Yes, sir. All right, boys--let's go.
You are saying, in effect, that this is a forgery?

## Sure--sure. He must have a compass with him.
What's he bringing pigeons for?

## Well--who d'you take this time--Paine, Bill, Carl--or McGann?
Hey--you're into me for a buck already. I say--McGann. Shoot the whole dollar.

## No, not yet, Senator Paine--not hide nor hair of the man. You mean to say the boys haven't--?
Eight to five Little Boy Blue is plastered.

## What's this, Diz?
That old standing offer from Diz Moore--Poet of Washington Correspondents.

## Huh?
You know--Mrs. Diz Moore.

## What! Who?
You know--little worms--ambition.

## What show? Would you mind telling me what's coming off here?
Certainly. Now there's the principal actor in our little play.

## Who?
That gorilla in Man's clothing-- McGann.

## What do I play?
You play--left field.

## Yeah. What about the second act?
That's taking place outside now.

## Well--I stuck my foot in it again at the President's press conference today-- How come so early? Get the day off?
Paine.

## Do you know how I felt, Diz?
No. How'd you feel? Quick.

## Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?
I apologize.

## Good idea. When?
Any time.

## Okay. You don't mind?
I'll cherish ya.

## Have *you*?
No.

## Well, let's get going.
Do we *have* to?

## Where?
My first name's--Clarissa.

## Huh?
Yes, Joe, yes--right away.

## Whom are you calling--in the dead of night?
Taylor, my dear.

## Really, my dear--I don't feel like a thing.
Can't that wait, Hubert?

## No wonder--without your dinner.
Nonsense. Why don't you listen to your children for a change? You might actually learn something?

## Emma, which is it--Horace Miller or Henry Hill?
Well, your children are very bright-- and *they* say Jefferson Smith.

## Fine. The first thing to do is-- present Mr. Smith to the press--in the *right* way. Hurry him along, Bill.
Are you ready for him, Bill?

## All right, why?
Your name's spreading like wild-fire out here--you are the winterbook favorite to get on the National ticket.

## They put up *their* candidate? Who?
Y-yes, Jim.

## The--head?
Well, Jeff put that out himself.

## What stuff?
No, *sir*! You couldn't do better, Dad.

## Than what?
Jeff for Senator.

## Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence?
Yes. Come in.

## Is--uh--Jefferson Smith at home?
Certainly. Step right in.

## That's easy. Jefferson Smith.
A pet shop?

## What? Who?
I yield.

## I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
No.

## Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
Jeff, look--didn't you say something to the papers about wanting to create a National Boys' camp? Were you in earnest about that?

## Yes--the *benefits*! What's a man called Taylor got to do with this?
Ah, now, that's better.

## Will he *yield*?
For a *question*.

## Yes, sir, I yield for a question.
Does my colleague's piece concern Section Forty of the bill--a dam on Willet Creek?

## Yes, Ma?
Hello, Jefferson.

## What's your name?
J-Jefferson Smith.

## Gee--I'm sorry about that, Miss--you *are* Miss Saunders, aren't you?
Yes, I'm Saunders--and this is Mr. Moore--a member of the press. Meet the *Senator*, Mr. Moore.

## Whose statue is that?
I wouldn't know in the *day time*.

## With or without 'em. Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?

## No. What had you better--?
Oh--a wonderful thing--yes. Get you right in the mood--yes--yes.

## We're going right ahead with--*what*?
Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...

## My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
I know--but you--you're going to help.

## If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?
Committee.

## Why?
That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee.

## Why?
Yes, I see that.

## Good. Where are we?
The Steering Committee.

## This* is.
Yes. Sure. What's a Steering Committee?

## Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we now?
We're over in the House.

## Yes--sure. Why not? You don't mind if I take the time to get a pencil?
Yes, Senator--*twice*.

## Uh--have you? Did you ever have so much to say about something--you couldn't say it?
But you've just taken care of the spirit all right.

## He did?
Baltimore. Pure city-dweller.

## Have you always had to--work?
No complaints.

## No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders-- Everybody else calls you just plain \"Saunders.\" Why can't I?
Go right ahead.

## Saunders. That's better. Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
Terrible, thank you.

## Why?
Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.

## You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
Look--I think we ought to skip it.

## No--not today! Boy, I feel like a house afire! Saunders--how did I do?
Great.

## I--I don't know how I got it out. My heart was right up here all the time-- I wonder what Senator Paine thought of it?
Must have been tickled pink.

## Gee--I hope so. What's all this?
Contributions from boys who read about your camp.

## Already? All these letters?
Oh, those are only local. Wait'll they start pouring in from all over the country.

## Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?
Splendid.

## Uh--that's good. And--uh--you?
I'm splendid, too.

## And how's your bill, Senator?
Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean-- I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit. I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new.

## How's that, buddy?
I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred.

## Yes, *sir*. Let's *go* Henry.
Oh--you're *sure* of that now?

## What! Who?
That's what he's been doing since last heard from.

## What do you mean? What's going on?
The Head Man's writing a Bill.

## Did I hear right? Did he say *Willet Creek*?
Let's get away from here.

## Yes. Good morning, Saunders. Have you--uh--any idea how this happened?
The ranger's notices? No idea at all.

## No?
No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job.

## By the way, Mr. McGann just phoned-- in a high fever. Smith's gone again. Have you any idea where?
Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.

## How much does the Willet Dam mean to you, Jim?
Joe--I've got a lot of people to take care of in this State.

## Joe, that's coming a long way in twenty years since I met you practising law down there in Main Street.
I know, but is it worth the risk of a scandal now that a new man is going to the Senate?

## Jim--if what you say about the future is remotely possible--why not do as I say--drop things like this dam?
Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.

## Steamroller stuff, Joe? My methods don't go in Washington? They've done pretty well by now, haven't they?
Oh, Jim, that's beside the point. This boy's different. He's honest and beside he thinks the world of me. We can't do this to him.

## You won't stand for it?
Maybe he won't get up.

## How nice. How do you do, Senator?
Well, at the expense of some of the furniture, Susan--you've made another conquest.

## Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague?
Is there objection? You may proceed, Senator.

## Who are you?
Certainly.

## Deeds?
Yes.

## Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
Oh, yes - Deeds. Fine fellow. Very democratic. You won't have no trouble at all. Talk to anybody.

## Are you married?
Yes, sir.

## Any children?
No, no children.

## No. Are you?
No.

## You don't go out with girls very much, do you?
I haven't.

## Why not?
I don't mind though. I had a lot of fun doing it.

## Were you given an assignment to follow the activities of Longfellow Deeds?
Yes.

## Your Honor, this is absurd. The woman's obviously in love with him.
Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?

## Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
What's that got to do with it?

## Feel better now?
Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.

## What?
Oh - uh - nothing.

## Really?
There's just one thing more. If it weren't for Miss Dawson being here with me, I'd probably bump your heads together.

## I told 'em I'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.
Oh. What's happening about the opera?

## What did they say?
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.

## What did they say?
Huh? Oh. They said I was crazy. Said I wanted to run it like a grocery store.

## Have you seen the papers?
Uh-huh.

## Huh?
I say, to most people it's a washout.

## Now, what do you see?
There's Times Square.

## I'm not worrying any more. I suppose they'll go on writing them till they get tired. You don't believe all that stuff, do you?
Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know.

## What's that?
You said I was a lady in distress.

## You must have met a lot of swell society girls since you've been here. Don't you like them?
I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.

## Really?
Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.

## Yeah, I know.
You have?

## What did he play?
The drums. He taught me to play some.

## It had better be good.
He did?

## Couldn't sleep. Kinda wanted to talk to you. Do you mind?
No - not at all. I couldn't sleep either.

## Ready?
Gosh, she looks better every time I see her.

## Let's just walk, okay?
All right.

## Are you? When?
In a day or so, I think.

## A girl?
Well, here we are again.

## Hello, Mary?
Oh, hello darling.

## What's the matter, hon?
Nothing.

## Yeah, then what?
Search me. Ask the Gypsies.

## Huh?
No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks. Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.

## What'll I tell him if he calls up?
Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place.

## Now you're talking, Babe. I'll keep the whole front page open. What are you going to do?
Have lunch.

## Did it?
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.

## Is he really that big a sap?
He's the original. There are no carbon copies of that one.

## How'd you get the picture?
Had the boys follow us.

## When're you going to see him again?
Tonight, maybe. I'll phone him at noon. Oh, my lunch hour. I'm a stenographer, you know. Mary Dawson.

## What's bothering you, huh?
Last night he proposed to me.

## Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him?
I'm going to tell him the truth.

## Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.

## I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
That's the rub.

## Oh, as bad as that, huh?
Telling him is the long shot - I'm going to take it.

## Aw, listen Babe, I can't let you quit now. You're not going through with this thing, are you?
I know, Budington. We can't afford to have the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand times already.

## Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front door?
Yes, sir.

## Who? Miss Dawson?
Yes, sir.

## How's it going? Okay?
Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir.

## Gold, eh?
Yes, sir.

## Fourteen carat?
Yes, sir.

## Is that the best you've got?
Oh, yes sir.

## Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her. Get a smaller bowl, will you?
A smaller bowl of flowers.

## Stuff, sir?
That goo. That stuff that tastes like soap.

## Me sir?
Yes.

## I'll do no such thing. I'm going there myself. You're going with me too, Anderson - and you too, Cobb.
How is this, sir?

## Come on, John. What happened?
The smartest thing I ever did was to make that trip.

## Nuisance value?
They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.

## Yes! Yes! Let's get on with it.
Nuisance value. Maybe they have! Maybe they have! Maybe they have! Mr. and Mrs. Semple, please. How do you do?

## What was that you said he was?
Wants to know who the heir is.

## Are you sure this is the town he lives in?
I guess we'd better try somebody else.

## You can't?
I looked everywhere. I even went to his house. It's locked up.

## Yes?
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.

## Charlie, we're off! Papers all set?
Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.

## Mr. Longfellow Deeds?
Yes.

## Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds?
Yes.

## Are your parents living?
Why, no.

## Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
Mr. Cobb here is an ex-newspaperman associated with your uncle for many years - as a sort of buffer.

## Are you a married man, Mr. Deeds?
Who - me? No.

## What for?
You're going to New York with us.

## Will you have a cigar?
No, thank you.

## No?
I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band.

## Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
Oh - nothing. No extra charge.

## That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
Yes, but that's an added service a firm like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington usually donates.

## Huh?
I mean, about the Power of Attorney.

## Why not? Who is he?
A lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate. Tell him to see me at my office.

## Is Mr. Deeds in?
No - he's over to the park arranging for the bazaar, so's to raise money for the fire engine. Mal, you shoulda knowed he was in the park.

## Come in, please. Come in. Can I get you a cup of tea?
No, thanks.

## That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
No, I'm his housekeeper.

## Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
He and Jim Mason own the Tallow Works. But that's not where he makes his money. He makes most of it from his poetry.

## Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
Nah.

## Huh?
I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.

## Have a drink?
No, thanks.

## You'd better get right down there. That opera mob is about to break into the Mad Song from \"Lucia.\"
Thanks Oh, did you send that telegram to Jim Mason?

## Gee, I'm busy. Did the opera people always come here for their meetings?
Uh-huh.

## Only common sense.
That's funny. Why is that?

## Women! Ever heard of 'em?
He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.

## What do I care about Arthur! Did you see this stuff in the paper? How'd it get in there? What'd you do last night? Who were you talking to?
And what'd you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up.

## I don't remember. \"Cinderella Man!\" What do they mean by that?
They'd call you anything if you gave them half a chance. They've got you down as a sap.

## But what about this \"Cinderella Man\"?
Yes, I guess I'll have to.

## You shouldn't be running away like this. What's going to happen to the Estate?
They can have the Estate.

## Not hungry. I want to get through this work in a hurry, and then I want to go home. What price did you get on those trucks?
Come on, come on. What are you trying to do, kid? Keel over? You haven't been out of this house in two weeks.

## Well, maybe I will have a sandwich. Do you mind waiting a few minutes?
Cobb! Get lunch for the rest of them.

## I'm Chairman?
Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected.

## Wait a minute. What does the Chairman do?
Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings.

## We own an opera house, don't we?
We provide opera.

## But you charge. I mean, you sell tickets?
Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.

## Now, where were we?
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.

## Uh-huh.
Why not?

## Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
Oh, yes. Yes, of course Dr. Von Holler. Very interesting.

## It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?
Ja.

## It takes so long to detect them because their mood changes so often and so quickly. Now, Your Honor, may I show you? May I use the chart?
Let him alone.

## Mrs. Semple?
Yes. Your uncle's common-law wife. She has a legal claim on the estate.

## What kind of wife did you say she was?
Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.

## A child? My uncle's?
Yes, sir.

## Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?
You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.

## What about it, Mr. Deeds?
Why, I turned them down, naturally.

## Huh?
I say we don't want to appear greedy.

## And don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?
Mrs. Semple is entitled to one- third of the estate.

## One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
Well, we didn't expect that much. I'm sure I can get her to settle quietly for one million.

## Yes. Have you any peculiar characteristics when you are creating?
Well, I play the tuba.

## You mean to tell me you don't carry a pocketful around with you?
Look, he's temperamental.

## Yes?
An O-filler. You fill in all the spaces in the O's, with your pencil. I was watching you.

## Anything else, Mr. Deeds?
No. Yes. There's just one more thing I'd like to get off my chest before I finish.

## Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
Uh-huh.

## Oh, the poet? Where?
Over at that big round table. The one that looks like a poodle.

## Binge?
I don't know.

## How about lunch? Are the gentlemen going to stay - or not?
Don't pay any attention to her.

## Hear what he said? You know how much twenty million is?
I don't care how much it is. You sit right there and eat your lunch. You haven't touched a thing.

## What is your name?
Christian Svenson.

## Farmer?
Yes, ma'am.

## Where is your farm?
South Dakota north.

## South Dakota - north?
Huh? Oh, yes - yes, of course. Her sister. Yes, I've been her sister for a long time.

## You mean by the neck or something?
Sure. They got on my nerves, so I threw 'em out.

## Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?
Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.

## It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?
Oh yes, I think it'd be a swell night to go for a walk. A nice long one.

## Tails tonight, sir?
What - tails? Why, that's a monkey suit! Do you want people to laugh at me? I never wore one of those things in my life.

## What do you think you're doing?
Why, I'm assisting you, sir.

## Excuse me. What did you say?
He talks about women as if they were cattle.

## Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.

## Twenty! What did he do with them?
Yes, sir.

## Prairie? Oysters?
Yes, sir. It makes the head feel smaller.

## Oh. Oh! Has Miss Dawson called yet?
Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.

## Looking for?
You kept searching me last night, sir. Going through my pockets. You said you were looking for a rhyme for Budington.

## Who?
Madame Pomponi. She says everything is all set for the reception.

## You try it.
What do you mean by coming in here when I'm playing?

## Me, sir?
Yeah.

## Me more than most.
Shall I call the police, sir?

## Why are they ganging up against me?
I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you.

## They said if I didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more. What do you think about that?
Good kids.

## Hmm?
I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.

## One hundred books?
It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened.

## What happened?
You must have been concerned.

## Doubtful. What did he say?
I know my time's up, but I've got to get this out while I've got hold of it --

## \"There's no shame in getting a little therapy\", right, Doc?
Dr. Mumford.

## Could you come with me please?
I know I shoulda come to your office. I was gonna, actually, but then when you walked in here today...

## What's that?
Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.

## That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?
No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.

## Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
Sure. Why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.

## I'm not sure she'll come. She's in a mood. Do you ever go to somebody's house?
Generally that doesn't work out so well. It sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change.

## Were you supposed to have a session?
No. It's sort of spur of the moment.

## A friend?
Better make yourself comfortable. We got a three hour drive here.

## You're the shrink, aren't you?
No, not really.

## But you do therapy?
I think he's got a point.

## So... the University of Kentucky. Who runs the program down there?
But they're certainly dead. And yes, personally, I find it a bit odd.

## Oh, for god's sake, Phyllis -- we have no reason to doubt the man! Are we listening to Lionel now?
Phyllis, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout...

## Right now?
I've run on. Forgive me. We're here to talk about you.

## Are we?
My mentor was an amazing teacher named Benton Mandlebaum. Died quite tragically in the collapse of a gazebo.

## Interesting approach. What was his name?
Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She passed last year in a train wreck. Damned Amtrak.

## What kind of doubts?
I see.

## What's that?
Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. Which leaves you the only psychologist in town.

## What?
Stop now.

## You find it distasteful, don't you?
It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.

## No?
You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip.

## Where's your wife, Henry?
Go to hell.

## What's that?
You are so mean.

## What is it?
It's a thought I had.

## Should I open it now?
Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help.

## But you did come to me.
What exactly is it supposed to do?

## And the experiment is in here?
My name's Gilroy. I'm from the State Certification Board.

## Do you want to come in?
I'm not at liberty to say. Sometimes it's just routine, sometimes there's been a complaint. We'll be in touch.

## I think you'll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars?
Nope.

## Are you a man who likes to treat himself right?
I've had my moments.

## Althea hasn't told you?
We've been talking about her, mostly.

## We've done... very well. You know anything about addiction, Doc?
A little.

## Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score. So what do you think?
Tastes good.

## What do you think's wrong with her?
She's gone weird is what's wrong with her. Out of control. Probably from living out here in Mayberry.

## You're the doctor, what do you think?
She seems very unhappy.

## Clarence Norman White, do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged?
I do.

## ...People who have come to you with the faith that you know what you're doing... and that you are who you say you are?
Yes, your honor.

## What?
I'm sorry you're frustrated.

## Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.

## Oh?
Upstairs, with Doc... Yeah, it's very nice... I heard your shower.

## So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?
I'd better get in there.

## What are they?
Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.

## You do?
Yeah.

## You're early... it's not ready. What happened?
My patient had to leave early.

## Does the phrase \"nosy\" have any meaning to you, Lily?
I think it's like... inquisitive.

## What do you want to know?
You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.

## How long you been in this town?
Oh, I don't know...

## You like me. How come?
Not sure. Let me think about it.

## Do we run into the street? No, I didn't think so. Nice car. How's that place?
It's a pretty piece of land.

## Horror show. What'd you do tonight?
It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call in the National Guard. Then I did my laundry... watched 20/20.

## ...And?
Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful? You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.

## Why do you watch?
They come through a few times each year. Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you again! It's a tour.

## Where am I supposed to eat?
You're on your own today, honey.

## ...so rich?
...so accomplished.

## I want to give you something. Will you let me?
Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.

## That's it? That's what you're giving me?
Clean up the mess. No matter what it takes.

## Thanks for your help, Lionel.
Don't you at least have a back door I can use?

## But you know how to drive?
Sure.

## Got a license? But no car?
Don't need it.

## Can you help Mom?
I'm trying.

## Is she a friend of yours?
No... sort of. Man, she could be cool, but all she does is get wrecked and do all the guys. She's blowin' them in the parking lot.

## How are you?
Insane! Didn't ja hear? My family got five hundred times better. Let's go, Vanessa.

## What's happening here?
We're going for a walk.

## Do you think that's a good idea?
Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway.

## What kind of doctor are you?
It'll never happen! You're in big trouble, mister.

## What'd you want?
There's something I think we need to talk about.

## What?
Finally, some common sense...

## What do you mean?
I think you know what I mean.

## Why don't you tell me?
Why don't you go to hell? It's all a bunch of nonsense and you know it.

## Could I see Sofie, please?
No, you can not. I wouldn't know who to say is calling.

## You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you?
No.

## Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
Hmm.

## Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?
Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out.

## What would you do?
We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot.

## You have the best answer for everything. You seem so... hopeful. Are you always this sunny?
No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.

## Can I ask you something? Didn't you tell my dad you didn't think it was a good idea to come to the patient? So what changed?
I'm not making any promises.

## Is she against you getting help?
We don't discuss it.

## What?
Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch? Just kidding.

## Is this the treatment?
Sorry... I'm done.

## Sore throat?
Uh-huh.

## Painful lymph glands? Forget fulness... irritability... depression?
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.

## Where?
Life.

## Did you get headaches before this? But you get more now? Or more severe?
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.

## So the headaches may not even be a part of this?
I can give myself a headache instantly.

## There... I've given myself a real whopper.
Is that like a party trick?

## That was really bad, wasn't it?
Disgusting.

## Is that when you split up?
No, that'd be a good story, but that was just the beginning of the end. We went on for another year or so.

## So whose route is this?
Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door.

## You like it?
It's all right.

## And this is legitimate therapy?
Therapy? Hell no, I just don't want to do it alone.

## Which thing?
Either one.

## Why'd you come to the house the other night?
I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't.

## That's... good?
I don't know if --

## I need to talk to you... Doctor. Can I come in?
Of course.

## Is something wrong, Sofie?
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.

## Why don't you tell me what's on your mind?
Um-huh.

## The point is this -- I am not a blank page. I did not just fall off the turnip truck. Do you know what I mean?
I think so.

## Transference.
What was that?

## Hello?
Hello.

## Which show was that?
Sofie...

## ...How violated I feel?
You're not the only one...

## You feel violated?
Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.

## Will you think about it?
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.

## What is your name?
You got off easy.

## Will you wait for me?
We're only talking about six weeks.

## Will you be here?
Of course... I haven't got the energy to get out of town that fast.

## What do you mean, \"in no time\"?
In maybe three or four issues.

## Why do you think you tell me, Nessa?
Don't do that thing... ...that shrink thing.

## The school board doesn't pay you? What kind of deal is that?
It's called pro bono.

## Pro boner? Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?
It's my bit for the community.

## Have women found you attractive?
That's not quite what I said --

## What do you want me to see?
Just chill for a second. Look at this guy, it appears he's actually dead... but gorgeous.

## Was it something that happened at school?
These appointments were not my idea, remember.

## True. Should we stop them?
I don't think you know what you're talking about.

## Do you think that's what he wants?
What'd he say?

## No again?
I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines.

## He agreed?
You're Doc Mumford. Skip Skipperton.

## How are you?
Fine. Okay. Pretty good. I've been hoping we'd meet. I've heard a lot about you.

## Would you like another beer?
Nah... scotch.

## Can I ask you a personal question?
Of course! That's exactly what I want.

## Is that the question?
You moved here from back East and your name is the same as this town. Is that right? Far out.

## I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got?
Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got.

## Don't you like this?
Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.

## Lily and I talk a bit. You know Lily, runs the coffee shop?
No... I've seen her. Good-looking woman.

## Doc. I know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday...
What kind of person do you have to be to do this?

## That's all right. What's on your mind?
How many sessions have we had now, Doc? Six. And it's been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. Just shootin' the shit.

## You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I supposed to be able to tell you everything?
It's just a thought.

## Okay... let's say that, for now.
Yeah, well... what I was gonna tell you --

## Slash what?
Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.

## No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
Sounds like kind of a good idea.

## Really?
Definitely.

## Who else knows?
Just you.

## Damn! What is your name?
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.

## What about everything? How did this happen?
Everybody has a story, Skip.

## An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
It wasn't the best situation.

## Did you carry a gun?
Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife.

## And the drugs?
Somebody's taking a shower down there.

## And a birth certificate is enough?
Everything flows from that, and what doesn't... can be easily purchased.

## But you studied psychology, right? You did the training and just never got the degree?
No... no training.

## Psych major?
English Lit.

## This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.

## Really?
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.

## What'd I do?
Lily... ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily.

## What?
Hmm. I guess that doesn't help... I see where you're going here. It's a mess.

## Why don't I call you when I've got my calendar in front of me?
It's possible. I don't know about that.

## You know where he's taking her?
Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual.

## Who the hell are these guys?
Priests. Imhotep's priests.

## And what ritual would that be?
The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life.

## And how does one do that?
By reading the Book Of The Dead.

## Excuse me?
If he arrives before us, it will be too late.

## Personally, I would like to surrender. Why can we not just surrender?
Shut-up and gimme your bandolier.

## None of the above, thank you.
In the desert? What for?

## Then what the hell are you doing here!?
My very good friend! What a surprise.

## I've had worse.
Let's make us even, shall we?

## C'mon, friend.
Goin' somewhere?

## Why do you like to fight so much?
Cause I look good doin, it.

## Beni ya little stinkweed, where did you slink off to?
You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.

## Oh yeah,... sorry bout that. So who's this guy?
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.

## Oh, hey, how ya doin'?
The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid.

## Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.

## Where's your new friend?
What friend? You're my only friend.

## Then you got no excuse for living. What the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, Beni? What's in it for you?
It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.

## Immune from what?
You shall see.

## What does he want the book for?
Something about bringing his dead girly-friend back to life. He needs the book... And your sister.

## Like what that Moses guy did to that Pharaoh guy?
That's one way of putting it.

## What just happened?
All I remember is him turning into a blast of sand,... and then I remember nothing.

## Yeah?
Oh yes, always.

## ...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach?
Intestines.

## When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you?
See the cartouche there, it's the official royal seal of Seti the First, I'm sure of it.

## No! She has seen too much. She knows too much.
What is he doing here?

## The key!? She has the lost key!?
Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.

## Forget the bumbling Americans, they will be like all the others. Without the map to guide them, how can they possibly find Hamunaptra?
I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.

## Okay, let's cut to the chase. He's afraid of cats, what's that about?
So your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold --

## Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue.
You think it'll send this guy back to hell?

## Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
The hell with that! I'm not goin' nowhere! We're safe here.

## The hell with this. I'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink. You want somethin'?
Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.

## And what is he in prison for?
I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.

## And what did he say?
He said... he was just looking for a good time.

## Where are they taking him?
Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.

## What are you doing here?
I have come to protect my investment, thank you very much.

## No.
So who's the broad?

## No?
No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.

## How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra?
Because that's where I found it. I was there.

## Yeah, I was there.
You were actually at Hamunaptra?

## You swear?
Every damn day.

## What did you find? What did you see?
I found sand. I saw death.

## Want to know?
Yes.

## The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
Really want to know?

## Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
If you call that a kiss.

## Did I miss something? Are we going into battle?
The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died.

## Ahmar is Ossirion. \"Passageway to the underworld\", actually.
Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. What do you think is out there?

## And the fact that they say it's made out of pure gold, makes no nevermind to you, right?
You know your history.

## Can you swim?
Well of course I can swim, if the occasion calls for it.

## For what?
We're about to be shown the way.

## What are those mirrors for?
Ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see.

## Preparation for what?
For entering the afterlife.

## Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
They didn't, they buried him at the foot of Anubis. He was either someone of great importance. Or he did something very naughty.

## There's some sort of lock here. You say these thing's are made of granite with a steel interior?
Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.

## Who was talking about what?
Seems the Americans had a little misadventure of their own today, three of their diggers were killed.

## How?
No. I believe if I can see it and I can touch it, then it's real. That's what I believe.

## I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But I'm proud of what I am.

## And what is that?
I'm going to kiss you, Mister O'Connell.

## I'm not?
Not unless you call me Rick.

## Why would I do that?
Because that's my name.

## No... Why?... Should I?
Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.

## Is he supposed to look like that?
No. I've never seen a mummy look like this. He's, he's still...

## Are you saying somebody threw these things in with our guy, and they slowly ate him alive?
Very slowly.

## That bad huh?
The ten plagues?... You mean all ten plagues.

## You sure you outta be playin, around with that?
It's just a book, no harm ever came from a book.

## It's everybody's problem!
Yeah? So? Is that my problem?

## That's what I am to you? A contract?
Don't do it, Evelyn.

## Have you no respect for the dead?
Right now, I only wish to join them.

## Yes?
I think you found something.

## Two questions. Who the hell is Seti the First? And was he rich?
I'm your sister.

## But he's just a filthy criminal?
Way to go, Evy.

## Do you really think he'll show up?
Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.

## Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't we be going?
After all, you rode us night and day to win that bet.

## Did you ever see him eat?
I can't believe I allowed the two of you to get me drunk.

## Juicy?
Yes. He's more than four thousand years old and still decomposing.

## Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a total loss.
Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now what is this last symbol here?

## Hey,... don't I know you?
Um, well, you see...

## Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?
Awfully.

## And you're sure you can find the secret compartment?
OWCH! That's really got to hurt.

## You did not!?... We're not!?
We gotta get her back.

## Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like?
I knew you'd come. I left that skylight open for you.

## But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
Of course.

## Really?
I know that you're recruiting your old henchmen...

## I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
Um-hmm.

## And what's that?
That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.

## What --?
Everything's going exactly as we planned.

## Where are you going?
Head hunting.

## What are you doing all alone in the dark?
Fantasizing... about you.

## I thought you were done?
One last tweak.

## Do I?
The Bowler? I remember him from when I was a kid. He was killed years ago.

## So who killed him?
The Disco Boys.

## When was that?
Well we can't call ourselves the Mystery People.

## Who are you?
I'm the Bowler.

## The Inscrutable Six?
But she's your mother. You gotta tell her.

## Hey... Can I buy you a beer?
I thought you'd never ask.

## What did he mean?
I dunno.

## Hey... you okay?
Sure.

## How's your dad?
He's dead.

## Have you considered my offer?
I got it.

## What about Captain Amazing?
Superheroes.

## Why bother?
That boy's got talent.

## Captain who?
You're nuts.

## Are you with me... or against me?
Against.

## Are you an actress?
Just a waitress.

## I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
Sure -- I guess.

## Who's the artist?
Me.

## Then why are you here?
Curiosity.

## What?
I saw him walk you home.

## Who?
Not tonight.

## Alone tonight?
Every night.

## Date?
Yeah.

## I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me home?
Sure.

## Why?
Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish.

## It is?
Most people just want to make money or be famous or something. But you risk everything, just to help people.

## Who wouldn't?
I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress.

## What's your real name?
Roy.

## Have you always lived here?
Me too... I love this stupid old town. It's noisy. It's smelly. It's falling apart.

## What have they got that we ain't got?
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.

## Monica, where are you?
At the Frankenstein Center.

## What are you talking about?
Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now... I think you're wonderful.

## What?
Bye.

## So how do you know that you've ever been invisible?
Come on, guys -- we're fighting against evil.

## Good or evil, what's the difference?
You're the Sphinx.

## When are you going to take off that mask?
When I am sure I am among friends.

## What have the famous superheroes got that we don't?
Good point.

## You sure that's how you spell it?
Yeah.

## Are you coming or not?
I'll drive.

## Nah.
Why not?

## Who's chicken?
Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.

## Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
He hasn't stolen it yet.

## What's that?
But... only when no one is looking.

## So you're only invisible... to yourself?
No.

## So you're only invisible, when absolutely no one is looking at you?
Yes.

## Anybody got any?
Yes, Obie-wan.

## You guys going to a costume party?
We're superheroes.

## Are you famous?
Not yet.

## So you're like... struggling superheroes?
We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware...

## Really?
Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill. In his case, it's entirely emotional.

## So what can I get you?
Burgers all around. Medium. Rare. Raw.

## What are you doing in the silver drawer?
I use it... to fight evil.

## It is?
I always knew that you were special.

## You did?
Ever since you were a little boy... Come with me.

## Oh, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore. Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps -- and for what?
We take the licks and he gets the chicks.

## How long do you have to chase a dream before you realize it's not gonna happen?
Hi.

## Who are they?
The Disco Boys.

## Do we have to?
I got this cousin. He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible.

## The who?
He's a legendary masked Mexican crime fighting superwrestler and master of the machete.

## Whatever our name is.
Yeah, but how do we get to them?

## The bazookas?
Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and Casanova was their king.

## But how do we get in?
That was too close.

## Very well, General, what is it you wish to say?
I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.

## Well, has Your Majesty considered what Napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?
I will accept your assurance, but I'm afraid I don't see your point.

## What do you think Napoleon will do?
I think it's absolutely charming.

## Whatever suggested the idea to you?
I shall tell you in the strictest confidence -- when I was a boy, I had a passion for rafts, and never had the opportunity to build one.

## What do you mean?
I know absolutely nothing of war -- and I am still totally dependent upon my generals.

## Yes -- who spoke up?
I did, sir.

## Yes, Captain? Have you anything you wish to say?
Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.

## May I come to the map?
Ah, my dear friend, come in, come in. Please sit down.

## Thank you for coming. Would you care for a drink?
No, thank you.

## What do you have in mind?
To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.

## Are you serious?
I don't even know whether a defense is possible.

## What forces do you have at your disposal?
About 5,000 troops.

## Cavalry?
The 21st Dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers.

## Any cannon?
There are none here.

## Where are they?
Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.

## Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
Properly arranged, yes.

## Are you proposing to transfer command to me?
In every practical sense, yes, but, officially, of course, I would have to retain command.

## Well, Belliard, what's this? What are you doing here? Where is the enemy?
They are at the gates of Paris, sire.

## And where is the army?
It is on this road, sire, following me.

## And who is defending Paris?
Paris is evacuated, sire. The enemy is to enter at nine o'clock tomorrow morning. The National Guard is on duty at the gates.

## Who sent my wife and son out of Paris?
I don't know, sire.

## And where is Joseph?
I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.

## But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her?
I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.

## Who is there?
Bertrand, sire.

## Yes, sire?
No, sire... I was asleep.

## General Bonaparte?
Come back in an hour.

## Was it he who assigned you to command the escort which accompanied Madame Bonaparte's coach?
Yes, sir.

## Was the trip normal in every respect?
Yes, sir.

## Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?
No, sir, none at all.

## Yes, sir?
A glass of champagne, please.

## Yes, sir. I hope you will excuse me for asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican?
Yes, I am.

## Bastia -- and you?
Ajaccio.

## Have you been back recently?
I haven't been there for three years.

## I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
No, they're living in Nice now.

## That's a nice city. This is your first time here, isn't it?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.

## You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
Ah-hh, no.

## Why are you carrying the dog?
His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.

## When you eat him, may I have some?
My God -- don't you recognize Mouton -- our regimental dog? I would rather eat Cossack.

## My God...! What time is it?
The first reports came in at about ten.

## Why didn't you wake me then?
At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.

## How did it spread so quickly?
It is the work of incendiaries.

## Good heavens, Ambassador -- what has happened?
Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I'm afraid I've been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall.

## Indeed you have, Ambassador. Have you sent for a doctor?
I beg your indulgence, Ambassador, but it is.

## Oh?
The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise.

## But this is not a matter which can be settled tonight, surely?
No one can say how the Emperor's thoughts work, Ambassador, and unless we move quickly, he might change his mind again.

## I have met her. What is your business with me?
I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.

## And he sent you to me?
He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.

## Does your mother know you have come?
No, sir.

## You realize, of course, that thousands of swords have been collected. How do you expect me to find yours?
Ah, my dear Francis, what a genuine pleasure it is to meet you at last.

## Shall we move closer to the fire?
Yes -- an excellent idea.

## Will Alexander be joining us soon?
I very much doubt that he will.

## Oh...?
I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.

## Would you like some brandy?
Thank you.

## Francis, may I ask whether you wear warm winter underwear?
No -- not as a rule.

## The weather is terrible, isn't it, sir?
Yes, it is. It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.

## Then what brings you out on such a night?
Well, one must do something to live, you know -- and I have an elderly mother who depends on me.

## One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
No, I'm only here on leave. My regiment is at Valence.

## Are you staying with a friend, sir?
No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.

## Is it a nice warm room, sir?
Well, it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street.

## Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?
Uh-hh... yes, of course -- if you would like to go... there... but... I have very little money.

## Do you have three francs, sir?
Br-rrr, these sheets are like ice.

## What's your name?
Lisette.

## Only Lisette?
Lisette La Croix.

## That's a very nice name. Where are you from?
Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.

## Junot?
No... nothing at all.

## You would tell me, Joseph, wouldn't you?
Yes, of course, I would. You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this.

## And you, Junot?
The important thing is to find the right lawyer. One who will not protract the thing indefinitely, in the courts.

## Are you trying to insult me?
Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.

## When is she supposed to return?
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.

## Oh... I see. I understand. How is... the Emperor?
I rarely see him, Your Highness, but I believe he is in excellent health, and he is very happy with the child.

## Oh... yes, of course! Have you met my daughter, Hortense?
Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.

## May I offer you a drink?
Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.

## Yes, of course. Hortense, darling, will you tell Louise to bring some sherry?
Yes, I'm afraid he is. I believe he is riding. I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.

## Oh... how very nice of you to bring that for Eugene... Did General de Beauharnais give it to you?
I thought I was. I was confused.

## And now?
Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.

## Do you expect me to believe that?
Yes.

## And you, are you in love with any one else?
No.

## Were you in love with any of them?
No.

## Were they pretty?
Yes.

## Were any of them prettier than I am?
One had better legs.

## Were any of them married?
Yes. They were the easiest. I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.

## Yes -- what is it?
Open the door. It's me.

## Where is Madame Trillaud?
How should I know. Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.

## What are you doing in there?
Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous! If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.

## Will you be joining us, soon?
I will be there in five minutes. Go back to your guests.

## Separate bedrooms?
Yes.

## Not be safe? What on earth are you talking about?
In case of a... surprise attack... at night... I am such a... light sleeper... I could wake you... I could scream.

## Who is it?
It's me.

## God damn it, Junot, wouldn't you think I have enough things on my mind not to waste time on a letter like this to Joseph?
There's probably some explanation.

## Why did you give it to him?
I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.

## I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?
He's downstairs -- somewhere.

## Yes... but, first, can I say something to you, as a friend?
Certainly.

## Why not?
Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.

## What are you talking about?
Nothing. That's all I can say.

## That's all you can say? What are you talking about?
Yes.

## What?
Yes, I wrote it.

## You couldn't face telling me what?
About Hippolyte Charles.

## Do you know what you're saying?
God help me -- yes.

## How do you know?
I know.

## How do you know?
I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of Dijon. It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's.

## You could hear them?
Yes.

## You mean you heard them making love?
Yes.

## How did you know it was Captain Charles?
I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.

## And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
I believe so. I believe Madame Bonaparte was not discreet, in Paris.

## Good day, monsieur. Do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell?
My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.

## If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction?
If you wish to put things on that basis, then I will say good day to you, monsieur.

## And, where did you see my portrait?
Ah, you must forgive me, my dearest Marie-Louise, I saw it during one of my stays at your palace -- at Schonbrunn.

## And, you, my dear wife, do you find that I resemble my portraits?
You are much younger, and much more handsome, than your pictures.

## Do you like music?
Yes, I do -- very much.

## You are so good to me. Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.

## Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.

## Do you know the joke about the two Swiss boys who go to a bordello for the first time?
No.

## Does she deserve anything better?
Those are extremely harsh terms.

## Has Alexander agreed to this?
Yes, he has.

## Do you think Alexander has any chance to succeed as a mediator?
England can make no move against you on the Continent without Austria. A reliable treaty with Austria would end her hopes in that regard.

## And where do you place Alexander?
Alexander and I are friends. We have reached an understanding.

## I am looking for Monsieur George Varlac who resides in the Rue de Frelicot. Do you know him, monsieur?
Very well, Citizen Lieutenant. You have come to the right place, for I am Citizen Varlac.

## What did you say his name was?
Eugene de Beauharnais.

## Is he alone?
Yes, sir.

## That's it?
Just tell him to come over here and talk to me.

## And I can go free?
Go, fo' I change my mind.

## Hey, Debo, heard you running from a ass- whippin'?
Naw, it ain't like that.

## You know me? I would've shot his big ass. Hey, Willie, how's it going? Still steppin' in dog shit every day?
Thanks, Unc.

## It's cool, but where's the water?
Don't need water. We didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.

## Y'all never use it?
Never... But me and Suga can get real nasty in that Jacuzzi, though.

## Why you say that?
Cause your lips is getting black.

## Daddy, Uncle Elroy, I need your help.
Negro, what the hell you doing to my woman?

## Me, too. You think they're in there?
Yup.

## Who are you?
I'm his cousin.

## Where's that boy that told me Day-Day was here?
I don't know... I think he went out the back.

## Where you going?
Ain't the rest room this way? I gotta pee.

## What you mean talk to her?
You know what he mean, dude.

## That's cron-don, sir. My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite?
Naw, I already ate.

## Sorry, bro, reflexes. How did you do that?
Black magic.

## What about the dog?
Dude, dogs hate me. I don't know why. Me and K-9's just don't get along.

## Fuck, what's his name?
Cheeco.

## Whatever you say, man. I didn't see shit. The safe combination is 34-5-27. Just take it all.
Shut up! Fo' I pump this Glock in yo' ass! What did you do wit Day-Day and Roach?

## What's crackin'?
You. Hi, Uncle Willie.

## Who is that?
Joker, he just got out of the pen. Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority. And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.

## This you?
Yeah, that's me. Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.

## Oh, yeah, where you work at?
Thanks for reminding me.

## Yeah, I'm alright. Is my face still orange to you?
Just a little.

## What?
Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing.

## Restraining order? Where the hell you meet this girl?
I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way. Worst day of my life.

## You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
You don't know Baby D.

## Who is that?
That's the sister.

## Why?
So.

## What you mean, so?
If you 'get into it' with them S.A.'s and start a feud, you can always go back to home. I gotta live here. Just remember that.

## You walked?
Yeah, ya'll got a notice today. It came certified mail.

## You know what this is?
Yeah, that's why I walked down here.

## I don't know. Did ya'll forget to pay it or something?
It says we owe $3,900...by tomorrow.

## Damn...how much money ya'll got left from the lottery?
$247.

## What's the matter?
D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.

## This vacuum don't work. Where's the restroom?
Out the door and to the left.

## Craig, what the hell are you doing?
Nothing.

## What we gonna do?
I don't know yet.

## You see that?
I didn't see nothing.

## What's the B-G's?
The bubble guts. I'm so nervous it feels like I'mma shit on myself.

## What you see?
That pump was full of money. I saw where they put it. Stay right here, I'mma climb in and go get it.

## You sure you don't wanna stay?
Naw, I'm got live ghetto fabulous. make sure you get that car fixed.

## I will. When can I come visit?
I don't know. Probably next Friday.

## Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty good together. Where you going?
To the Cucamonga shopping center.

## Oh yeah, why you walking?
My brothers won't give me a ride.

## You want us to give you a ride?
I don't know.

## Hello, remember me?
Hell yeah, I remember you.

## What? So you snuck in my room to tell me that?
Yes I did. Excuse me.

## You did all this for me?
Most of it. I just hate to see you in this situation.

## Why didn't she put'em out?
Easier said than done. We saved up to get away from them, but they followed us.

## I did. Is that door locked?
It's locked.

## You alright?
Yeah, I'm cool. See you later.

## Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for?
I don't play for no team.

## Naw, I play for the Chocamunga Cracker Killers. You want tickets?
Okay, buddy. Don't send your entourage out here to do a 187 on me. It's just a certified mail delivery.

## What is it?
Delinquent Property Tax Notice... I hope the Cracker Killers pay well 'cause if not, back to the ghetto you go. Wife stays here, of course.

## I do.
What's the matter?

## What it smell like?
Smells like you didn't fall in no mud.

## Nice neighborhood, huh?
Hey, Pops, I'm grown. Can't nobody get me in trouble no more.

## You see that?
I saw it.

## Smokin' what?
Nothing.

## KYM I said...are you 'bout it, 'bout it -- rowdy, rowdy?
Yeah, I'm 'bout it.

## What kind of activity?
KYM Strange activity. I think they running drugs off Tijuana. Day-Day don't believe me.

## Nice to meet you?
KYM Peace out, Craig.

## Sir, the manager stepped out for a moment. I'm currently running the store. Can I see the CD?
No, give me my damn money back. Right now, and I don't have no damn receipt neither.

## Okay, sir...but where's the cover?
I don't have no damn cover.

## Yeah, it was. How you get up here?
Craig, this Roach. Roach, this is my cousin, Craig.

## What it say?
Ever since my momma died the bills are always late.

## What is it?
Don't worry about it, man. Get the phone.

## That the big one, huh?
You damn right that's the big one.

## What was that?
You don't wanna know.

## Are they still out there?
Negative...they vamped.

## Roach, what are you doing?
R-U-S-H Intensely.

## Who the fuck is that, Day-Day?
Let it go, Roach, trust me.

## Why did he go in the house?
Don't worry about it. We gotta figure out a way to get Craig out of there. He's probably getting tied up now.

## You wanna knock?
Go for it.

## ...and some rolling papers, that's it. We didn't mean to mess up y'all get together or nothing. How y'all doing?
Hey.

## What?! What that mean?
He's a boy, dude.

## 20 minutes?
Yeah, 20 minutes. Trust me. I've been pepper sprayed nine times. 20 minutes.

## Where's Craig?
I don't know.

## What the fuck you looking at?
Nothing.

## Why would he take it? He don't even know you.
Uh...um...I mean uh, can we borrow a cup of sugar?

## Shut up! Where's that other miyatea?
Tape his mouth shut.

## Where did Craig move to?
I don't know, Debo.

## What you say?
He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his cousin Day-Day.

## Rancho Cucamonga?
Yeah.

## What urgent message?
I can't feel my legs no more.

## Me neither. How far is Rancho Cucamonga?
We must be here 'cause we stopped.

## I thought you were taking me to see Mama?
I'll take you later.

## When? After you get all drunk and loaded?
Hey! I said I'll take your fuckin' ass later. Now get out of here. You're scaring our company.

## Are you going to take me to see Mom?
Take your car.

## Somebody left me a message. Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
I don't know. Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them.

## What about that ugly dog?
I got my mase.

## What's the matter?
I slip my disc, again... Oh got damn.

## Mr. Nasty time?
Mr. Nasty time. But take it easy on me, girl.

## Elroy, what happen?
I threw my back, again.

## Aw, no lovin' tonight?
Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.

## What's he doing here?
Who, him? Just visiting.

## What happened here?
Nothing. I broke a lamp.

## But I want to make some changes. Get Krista in here right away won't you?
Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand.

## You just come in on Amtrack?
Uh, yes..

## Business or pleasure?
Business.

## Where'd you come from?
San Diego.

## Better in San Diego? More opportunity there? What?
I really don't know. I don't live there. I was just visiting...a grave.

## The grave. Somebody close?
Look...I've... I've got a problem. A big problem...

## Oh, yeah?
I need your help.

## What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
Its'...ah...about my daughter....

## You were saying? Your daughter....?
I...

## Yes?
I saw her die. She was shot. With this gun.

## You shot her?
No.

## Who did?
I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.

## What?
And your husband works for somebody else.

## What the hell are you saying?
I knew you wouldn't believe me.

## For what?
For not believing you.

## Can we go now?
Of course. I'll get a car to drive you.

## No, that's... That's OK. We don't need any help. We'll be just fine. Won't we, Lynn?
Good luck.

## What?
Is this about those kids? Look, I'm sorry about that. But they darn near...

## You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?
Yes.

## Daddy?
Yes. It's OK, Lynn. These are our friends.

## What's your point?
I will do no such thing.

## Where did you get these? Who are you?
I'm the guy who's going to kill your daughter if you don't get moving.

## Are you 'fucking with me!?
The gun...

## What about the gun?
It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.

## What...?
Tell me why I miss him.

## He's dead?
That's right. He's dead. Tell me why.

## How should I...?
Tell me why he's dead.

## Do you now, Mr. Watson?
I kill her - and you kill me.

## Come back.
How am I supposed to get away?

## How do I know you won't kill my daughter once I'm gone?
Again.

## What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
You know what I'm gonna do.

## He'll think you're in the crowd until the end of the speech. Wait a minute.
What? Walk out there and twist her arm off?

## Are you sure?
I've heard this speech a lot. Come on. We'll take care of him. We will.

## Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.

## I'm serious, honey. Don't get out of my sight, all right? I want you to stay right by me. Will you do that for me?
Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh.

## Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss like that?
On TV.

## So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?
No way.

## Ready?
Nods.

## Now, see, this is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads. You never know when you're going to fall down and go boom. Right?
Yes. Yes, I can hear you.

## Can we go now?
Not just yet, baby. There's...there's something Daddy has to do.

## No, honey, not to be a hero. But I want you to remember something for me, all right?
All right.

## Will you promise me that?
I promise.

## What do you do, if I may be so bold?
I'm just an accountant.

## You got anything smaller?
Keep it.

## Can I get out to Flower Street from here?
Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you right out there.

## You remember me?
I remember. The big tipper.

## Mister, what are you dragging me into?
I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...

## This gorilla's watching you, is that right?
That's right.

## What are you supposed to do?
Kill the Governor.

## I knew I should have packed up and gone home as soon as I got that twenty. What am I supposed to do about this situation?
One of them is in on it. He might even be in charge. Her Security is in on it. There's only one person I know for sure isn't in on it.

## Who?
The Governor. If I could just talk to her...

## Then why'd you drag me into it?
It's my kid. I've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl.

## Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?
I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.

## What are you going to do?
Keep the change.

## What am I supposed to say to her?
It'll come to you. See if you can stop this thing 'fore it gets started. Save us all considerable embarrassment.

## Well?
I don't know.

## What are you going to do!?
This is about power and you haven't got any. There's nothing more you can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying.

## You're going to deny me a lousy dollar after I've sweated like a pig giving you the gift of a clean windsheild?
Fuckin' A.

## Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it?
It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.

## Could I see it?
You stole that.

## Everybody does?
Yep. And you can listen to it without anybody else listening. Let's try it out.

## My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers?
That's pretty good.

## You have, huh?
Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much more colors at home.

## Where are we going?
Not very far, honey-pie. Not far at all.

## You're a big girl, huh?
I'm not a big girl but I'm not a baby.

## Why?
I've got something for you.

## You got this under control?
Yeah.

## Somebody mind telling me... ) What the hell happened!?
Help me get her off the rug.

## Where is he? Did you lose him?
Shut up.

## What about them?
I'm looking for them.

## Where?
You don't want to cause a ruckus, with the little girl and all.

## And what happens if I don't call you?
I kill her anyway.

## What gives?
Just put her on.

## Any trouble?
No.

## What do you figure he done with it?
He took the secret with him when I dropped him.

## How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
I come not with Peace but with a Sword.

## You, Preacher?
That Sword has served me through many an evil time, Ben Harper.

## What religion do you profess, Preacher?
The religion the Almighty and me worked out betwixt us.

## Yes, Dad.
Where's your Mom?

## I been mindin' Pearl.
You understand?

## When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
Can't hear ye, boy. ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...

## And the times that are gone by. I'll have her ready inside of a week; and then we'll go fishin'. How's your Maw?
O, she's all right.

## How's your sister Pearl?
Just fine.

## Leavin', boy?
Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.

## Won't he bust it, Uncle Birdie?
Shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' whale.

## Do you mind me cussin', boy?
No.

## Can we eat him, Uncle Birdie?
She went.

## Where's Ruby?
She went.

## How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?
Plan on a longer visit next time.

## How do you mean?
Sshhh! He's in there.

## I'll be switched!...
Who?

## Now ain't you relieved, Walt?
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!

## What?
The money, Icey.

## How?
Thank you, no. Thank you, dear Icey. I'll tend to them. Thank you.

## Who's them Blue Men yonder?
Blue men.

## Why?
Just a man. Goodnight Pearl, sleep tight; and don't let the bedbugs bite.

## Where's Mom?
She's gone to Moundsville.

## To see Dad?
Yes, I reckon that's it.

## Why?
If we stay here somethin' awful will happen to us.

## Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
No, that's just it. No.

## Where are we goin', John?
Somewheres. I don't know yet.

## John?
Ssh...

## John, where's your folks?
Dead.

## Where ye from?
About them Kings. That the Queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time.

## Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
No. No.

## What's that you're playing with, boy?
Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.

## Now! Where's it hid, honey?
I'll tell.

## All right boy, where's the money?
In the cellar. Buried under a stone in the floor.

## What?
Go ahead of me -- the both of you.

## Don't you believe me?
Why sure, boy, sure.

## Now, Where?
Under the stone in the floor.

## Yes?
Now it's your turn.

## How old are you?
That's no secret. I'm five.

## What's your name?
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.

## Tst-tst! Then I reckon I'll have to try again! Where's the money hid?
Naturally.

## Can I have milk too?
Yes. But first of all we'll have a little talk.

## Why, pray tell?
Because John said I mustn't.

## Just tell me now; where's the money hid?
Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.

## Will you buy me a choclit sody?
O' course.

## Why, you're the purtiest girl I've seen in all my wandering. Didn't nobody never tell you that, Ruby?
No. No one never did.

## What's their names?
Pearl and John.

## Ahhh. And is there -- a doll?
It is my shame -- my crown of thorns. And I must wear it bravely.

## Didn't you have no inkling?
Yes; from the first night.

## The first night?
Our honeymoon.

## How's that?
She turned me out of the bed.

## What do you figure to do?
Do? Why stay and take care of them little kids. Maybe it was never meant for a woman like Willa to taint their young lives.

## Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
A scrawl. On a piece of notepaper on the bureau.

## Yes.
Do you want more children, Willa?

## Are you through praying?
I'm through, Harry.

## Ben never told you he throwed it in the river? Did he?
Mornin', ladies.

## Where's your Missus?
She run off with a drummer one night. Durin' prayer-meetin'.

## Where's she at?
Somewheres down river! Parkersburg, mebbe! -- Cincinnati! -- One of them Sodoms on the Ohio River.

## How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
This man down at the Drugstore...

## The Drugstore?
Miz Cooper. I never went to sewin' lessons all them times.

## What you been up to?
I been out with men.

## Now who was this?
He never asked me for nothin'.

## What'd you all talk about?
No, nothing.

## Look, I know it's been frightening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But... it's okay. Okay?
Please, Nancy. Trust us.

## How long's this been going on?
Since the murder. She was fine before that.

## What the hell are dreams, anyway?
What happened? That needle sank like a rock.

## Glen. Not now. I mean, we're here for Tina now, not for ourselves.
How can you tell?

## Why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway?
Because he was scary, that's why.

## Yeah. Something slippery all over here... Tina?
Sometimes I wish you didn't live right across the street.

## Shut up and let me in. You ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet?
Guess I did.

## Haven't slept, have you?
Not really.

## M'god, I look twenty years old. You have any weird dreams last night?
Slept like a rock.

## Well at least I have an objective wall to bounce this off. You believe it's possible to dream about what's going to happen?
No.

## You believe in the Boogey Man?
One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it.

## You believe in anything?
I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll. And I'm not too sure about you lately.

## Okay?
Okay, okay. I think.

## Used to. Not anymore.
Yeah. So?

## You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming?
No.

## They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?
Yeah.

## And what if they meet a monster in their dream? Then what?
They turn their back on it. Takes away its energy, and it disappears.

## What happens if they don't do that?
I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.

## Hello?
Hi.

## Oh. Hi, how y'doing?
Much better.

## Who?
The killer.

## You do?
Yeah, and if he gets me, I'm pretty sure you're next.

## Bring him out of what?
My dream.

## How you plan to do that?
Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.

## You crazy? Hit him with what?
You're a jock. You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile...

## Meanwhile...?
Meanwhile whatever you do don't fall asleep. Midnight.

## How you doing, pal?
Okay. Hi, dad.

## You got a sane explanation for what he did?
She dreamed this would happen...

## What?
Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.

## Dad -- what you doing here?
Hello Nancy.

## You know he's dead though, right?
Just tell me who did it and I'll go get him, baby.

## -- I want you to come over here and break the door down exactly twenty minutes from now -- can you do that?
Sure, but...

## Sure, okay, I'll be there. Now you just turn in and get some rest, sweetheart. Please. Deal?
She lived there.

## Who? Who did that?
Krueger.

## Krueger?
Had to've done it. No one else was in there.

## How you know that?
Maybe god's punishing us all...

## Like Rod Lane?
School.

## I'll sleep in study hall, promise. I'd rather keep busy, you know?
Right home after. See you.

## What?
You're not falling asleep, are you? You could drown, you know.

## I must be going nuts...
You okay?

## You okay?
Yeah. Just had a little dream. I'm falling right back to sleep.

## What's with the bars?
S'curity.

## So he's alive?
Go on...

## All these years you've kept those things buried down here? In our own house?
Proof he's declawed. As for him, we buried him good and deep.

## Feeling better?
They say you've bottomed out when you can't remember the night before. No more drinking, Baby, suddenly I just don't feel like it any more.

## He doesn't know you. Couldn't you change?
The cops were all over my house. They'll kill me for sure.

## And then what happened?
I told you. It was dark, but I'm sure there was someone else IN there, under the covers with her.

## How could somebody get under the covers with you guys without you knowing it?
How the fuck do I know? I don't expect you to believe me.

## Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
Because somebody cut her. While I watched.

## What you mean 'all at once'?
I mean, it was as if there were four razors cutting her at the same time. But invisible razors. She just... opened up...

## Do you think I did it?
No.

## Anyway, I'm too tired to worry about the creep. Couldn't get back to sleep at all. So what you dream?
Forget it, the point is, everybody has nightmares once in a while. No biggy.

## You feel better now, right?
Jungle man fix Jane.

## No more fights?
No more fights.

## When did you have a nightmare?
Guys can have nightmares too, y'know. You ain't got a corner on the fucking market or something.

## Have you any money?
Well, here are fifty francs.

## RUSSIANS What is it, Ninotchka?
It's from Paris.

## RUSSIANS From Leon!... How is he?... Come, tell us... open it... tell us... how is he?
Good evening, Anna.

## Aren't you late?
No, the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade.

## What are you serving?
An omelet.

## An omelet! Aren't you living a little above your ration?
Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.

## About what?
Ever since you have been back from Paris...

## Ninotchka, you know I am your friend, you can trust me.... Did you bring back anything else?
No, I left everything in Paris. I just happened to be wearing this.

## Tell me... what else did you have?
Well, a hat...

## What was it like?
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.

## Evening gown?
A dress you wear in the evening.

## What do you wear in the morning?
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.

## You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
Yes.

## And there?
Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.

## What is it, Anna?
You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...

## You want this?
Just for the honeymoon.

## Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades? And now you are afraid to take a room with a bath?
Possibly.

## If you hadn't given Commissar Razinin such a wonderful report about us, who knows what would have happened?
I can tell you exactly.

## Where is your courage, Comrade Buljanoff?
Now Comrades, I warn you... if it gets out in Moscow that we stay in the Royal Suite we will get into terrible trouble.

## Leon, how would you like to have three lifelong friends?
You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.

## How many families live here with you?
She's right... anyhow let's talk ourselves into it.

## Is there anything I can do for you, monsieur?
No, no.

## May I ask how much your rooms are?
Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.

## How are things in Moscow?
Very good. The last mass trials were a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians.

## You didn't get legal advice?
Comrade Buljanoff...

## Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?
With two f's, if you please.

## Is there anything I can do, Comrade?
Yes, Comrade.

## Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? How does he manage?
We have opened a restaurant...

## Who gave you this idea? What is responsible for all this?
You think because you represent the former Duchess...

## Well, gentlemen, how about my proposition?
About this telegram to Moscow. Why should you bother? I'll write it for you.

## Didn't we put up a strong resistance?
Oh, yes, yes.

## A blue shirt, perhaps?
Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.

## What time have you, Gaston?
Eight forty-two, sir.

## Have you?
Decidedly. Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir.

## Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?
No, sir.

## Yes, General Savitzky?
Are they indeed? Thank you.

## You're looking magnificent, Leon... ...isn't he, General Savitzky?
Yes.

## Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?
Thank you, Louis.

## Let's be honest. Have we anything like it in Russia?
Comrades, if we ring nine times... let's go in.

## Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money?
You know, Monsieur Mercier, this is all non-sense.

## What is it, my boy?
Leon, my little boy.

## How can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like?
We don't blame you, Leon, but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity...

## Don't look so gloomy, gentlemen. All is not lost. You may have a chance.
Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?

## I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
Oh, no, no. I am not a highwayman, I'm just a nuisance. All I'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible.

## What proposition?
I just said let's have a little lunch. Room service.

## What's the name of that Commissar on the Board of Trade?
Razinin.

## What did she say about me?
I think she covered you with the parasites.

## You found your way to us and we weren't easy to reach, were we?
No, no.

## How much does this cost?
Two thousand francs.

## A week?
A day.

## Two thousand francs. If I stay here a week I will cost the Russian people seven cows. Who am I to cost the Russian people seven cows?
Just looking around.

## Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
I'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe...

## Don't make an issue of my womanhood. We are here for work... all of us. Let's not waste time. Shall we go?
He is a porter. He wants to carry them.

## Why?... Why should you carry other people's bags?
Allow me, Comrade.

## What's that?
It's a hat, Comrade, a woman's hat.

## I hope so for your sake. Let us examine the case. What does the lawyer say?
We dealt directly with the representative of the Grand Duchess. I am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture.

## How are you, you three scoundrels?
Well, we're back home.

## I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we?
Yes. It is unfortunate.

## Well, there's nothing we can do about it. Why get excited?
We'll leave these papers here for your further consideration. Au revoir, madame.

## What can I do about it?
She has been asked to leave the powder room but without success. We would appreciate if you would see to it yourself.

## You want me to go in there?
I'm sorry, sir, but I must insist.

## What business?
On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them.

## You believe in our cause?
She must have her little joke. You're not going to take that seriously.

## That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement?

## What for... why?
Or a tunnel or a bridge...

## Yes. Could you give me some information?
Gladly.

## How long do we have to wait here?
Well -- until the policeman whistles again.

## How many minutes between the first and second whistle?
That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.

## Have you never been caught in a similar situation?
In other words you don't know.

## Can I help you?
You might hold this for me.

## Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?
No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.

## How long does it take a man to land?
Now, isn't that too bad! The last time I jumped I forgot to clock it! Let me see... Eiffel Tower... Your finger, please.

## Why do you need my finger?
Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.

## I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
I don't have to but I find it natural.

## For my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale?
Madame, it is that kind of approach which has made Paris what it is.

## You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?
Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.

## And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?
Yes, it is.

## I see a house that looks like any other house. What's remarkable about it?
It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.

## So that is your house?
Well, let's say I live in it. Such a pleasant place... all kinds of comfort, easy to reach, close to street car, bus, and subway...

## Does that mean that you want me to go there?
Please don't misunderstand me...

## Is this what you call the \"butler\"?
Yes.

## He looks sad. Do you whip him?
No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.

## Well, may I offer you a drink, or how about something to eat?
Thank you. I've had all the calories necessary for today.

## Is that customary?
I should say this room is eighteen by twenty-five.

## And what is your profession?
Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job.

## And what do you do for mankind?
For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak.

## Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
Your general appearance is not distasteful.

## Oh, I see. What do you use instead?
I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.

## What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.

## The bayonet? Did you really?
I was wounded before Warsaw.

## I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?
I'd love to. Tsk, tsk, tsk.

## What kind of a girl are you, anyway?
Just what you see. A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.

## Do you hear that?
It's twelve o'clock.

## Was that talkative?
No, that was restful. Again.

## Then how did you get here?
I always eat here.

## Must one always be after something?
Your tactics are useless. My name is neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski.

## Why?
Because we are an odd couple.

## On which boat?
Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.

## Do you like Scotch stories?
No.

## I'll tell you that joke again. A man comes into a restaurant. Did you get that?
Yes.

## You remember this room?
Not radio. Let's have music that's just for ourselves.

## Did you make any change in this room?
I don't think so.

## She is very attractive. She has great elegance. She's what you call a woman of the world, isn't she?
Ninotchka, I love you.

## How do you do?
And General Savitzky.

## A funny story?
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.

## No speech?
No speech.

## Are we going to build our little house?
Yes... a little white house.

## Would that make you any happier?
Much happier.

## Radio! What is radio?
Yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.

## Who cried that one?
It is their wish.

## Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses. Can I make a speech now?
Please.

## Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night?
Darling, I was busy looking out for your interests.

## Did you win?
Oh, Leon, you are so good to me.

## Those newspaper people?
Now, Swana...

## First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?
Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.

## Tell him I won't be able to see him for a half an hour.
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?

## Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
No.

## You haven't seen her yet?
That proletarian! In the old days we'd have had her flogged.

## Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! What does she look like?
You can't imagine.

## Thank you.
You saw all that in one glimpse?

## Is this your new dress suit?
Yes, Swana.

## Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you?
Yes, Swana, you did.

## It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
Yes, Swana.

## I've some wonderful news for you, Leon. It's about Punchy... do you mind if I sit down?
No... please...

## There's a charming crowd here tonight, isn't there?
Will you do me a favor? Stop talking about the good old days.

## Leon, darling, how nice! Have you ordered tea or a cocktail?
No thanks, Swana.

## Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?
I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.

## Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
Yes.

## I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?
Brutal frankness, if you insist.

## What is this, Swana?
Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.

## Has done what?
She's gone, Leon.

## Dear me... I must be losing my finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be understood by everybody.
Do you expect me to believe that?

## What?
I think we can cut your visit short. Leon is not here.

## Please come to the point. What is it you want?
I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.

## Believe me, Leon can't help you. He doesn't know anything about the jewels... I give you my word... I swear it.
My dear, you don't know how impressive I could be. Did you ever see me in my regalia with my diadem and all my jewels?

## Where are they?
You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.

## Where are they?
You leave me no choice.

## Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
Unfortunately.

## Why?
Well... that's my business, madame.

## Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?
Yes, it does.

## You mean you have finished the whole investigation?
Yes.

## That's marvelous.... You must have worked day and night.... Don't you ever sleep?
Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else.

## May I ask why?
Please... sit down.

## Cigarette?
Thank you.

## Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?
No.

## Oh, they shouldn't do such things. Are you sure this report is correct?
It gives details which couldn't be invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that's why I need you.

## You want me to go to Constantinople?
Yes... leaving immediately.

## This way, madame. Are you alone? By the window perhaps? Or a nice little corner table?
This will do.

## I think this is the first time you have been to my little place. Your face is new to me. Now, what shall it be?
Raw carrots and beets.

## But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about?
The future of the common people.

## Can you recommend a restaurant?
Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's...

## Where do you eat?
At Pre Mathieu's.

## Where is that?
It's just a place for workmen.

## Where is it?
Eight blocks down in the Rue de Poivrel.

## What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.

## But sir, we'll have to start over from the beginning. We don't have the staff to ...
Why do you bring this up after so many years?

## Where the hell is he?
Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...

## How's the job coming, Bob?
Frankly, sir, it stinks. I have no access. I'm lucky Helms lets me have a staff.

## Then what about this Washington Post crap? Woodwind and Fernstein?
Mr. President, Hunt wants more money. Another hundred-and-thirty thousand.

## What?
Hunt has nothing to lose now. Pardon all of them. Nobody's going to investigate a crime for which the criminals have already been pardoned.

## How much do you need?
Uh, I would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years ...

## I agree it's ridiculous but --
I agree it's ridiculous but --

## That's not the question, John. The question is, Why is he paying?
To protect his people.

## Who's gonna tell Mitchell?
You do it.

## Why me?
Cause he hates you. It's worse when you get it from someone you trust.

## How so?
The \"Old Man\" plays politics harder than anybody else.

## You think this is just about politics?
It's a code or something.

## Yeah?
Christ, we created Frankenstein with those fucking Cubans.

## Jesus! Did Mitchell know?
Mitchell's out of his mind now. Martha just put her head through a plate-glass window.

## Mitchell?
No! Magruder! That sonofabitch tests my Quaker patience to the breaking point.

## Hunt? Howard Hunt?
He left his White House phone number in his hotel room.

## Well, he's photogenic. Let's try dog bones?
I like it. I like the idea.

## Is it legal? I mean has anyone ever done it before?
Sure. Lyndon, JFK, FDR -- I mean, Truman cut the shit out of my investigation of Hiss back in '48.

## Where's Hunt now?
In hiding. He sent Liddy to talk to me.

## And?
He wants money.

## I don't know if I'd go that far, sir.
Uh, we've never done this before, sir ... How do we pay? In ... hundreds? Do you fill a black bag full of unmarked bills?

## Why not?
Is the war worth it? Is it worth a one-term presidency? Because I think right now that's what we're looking at.

## Yeah, good old Spiro. Well, better him than me. What the hell is he but an insurance policy?
He's begging for a meeting, chief. He wants to go overseas for awhile.

## What about England?
Forget it. Ehrenberg's paid three times that much ...

## This is June twentieth?
It's marked. Also there's June twenty third. And this year -- March twenty first. Those are the ones ...

## May I say something, Mr. President?
There's no secrets here, Al.

## Exactly! We've got to take the war to them. Hit 'em where it hurts -- right in the nuts. More assassinations, more killings. Right, Al?
Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.

## Who?
Cox! Fire him.

## Sir, the deadline is today.
So?

## Can we get around this, Al?
It's the Supreme Court, sir; you don't get around it.

## The army?
Lincoln used it.

## How do you see this?
We can't survive this, sir. They also have you instructing Dean to make the payoff to Hunt.

## They did what?! I don't understand. Why'd they go into O'Brien's office in the first place?
Evidently to install bugs and photograph documents.

## Contributions! It was a legal contribution. Who the hell authorized this? Colson?
We feel the bigger concern is Gordon Liddy ...

## What's Liddy got?
Apparently he was using some campaign cash that was laundered for us through Mexico. The FBI's onto it. We could have a problem with that.

## On the list of horribles, I know what he is. And I know what he tracks back to. You say he was involved in the Plumbers?
Definitely. Colson had him trying to break into Bremer's apartment after Bremer shot Wallace, to plant McGovern campaign literature.

## I had nothing to do with that. Was he ... in the Ellsberg thing?
Yes, you approved it, sir.

## I did?
It was right after the Pentagon Papers broke. They went in to get his psychiatric records.

## Our own intelligence capability -- to fix the leaks?
Howard Hunt? ... Jesus Christ, you open up that scab ... and you uncover a lot of pus.

## We'll work on it. I say we cut ourselves loose from these clowns and that's all there is to it.
What do you mean, sir?

## Should we talk to Trini about paying these guys? Or maybe Chotiner?
You approved that before the fact, because I went over it with you. But ...

## That's right, and it's more a problem for Ehrlichman. He fixed Hunt up with the phony CIA ID's, but ... what else does Hunt have on us?
Just do what I say, Bob.

## Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?
Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him. That's why I appointed him.

## How is this national security?
Because the President says it is. My job is to protect this country from its enemies, and its enemies are inside the walls.

## Sir?
I'll talk to Helms. Oh, Pat asked if you're coming to the Residence for dinner tonight.

## Yes, sir. I'll talk to Helms, and, uh ... what's our press position on this Watergate thing? What do I tell Ziegler to tell them?
He wouldn't do the makeup. Said it was for queers.

## Meanwhile, what happens to the country?
The bastard! If I'd called his shot on Cuba I would've won. He made me look soft.

## Where are they?
Dick, you don't have to make a statement. Herb covered it for you.

## I don't understand. Track 2's Chile?
The first assassination attempt was in '60, just before the election.

## Before?! Eisenhower approved that?
He didn't veto it. I ran the White House side. The mob contact was Johnny Roselli. One of the CIA guys was that jackass, Howard Hunt.

## Alright. But why, if Kennedy is so clean in all this, didn't he cancel Track 2?
... he'd just found out about Track 2.

## You never told him?
I didn't want him to get the credit. He said I'd stabbed him in the back. Called me a two-bit grocery clerk from Whittier.

## If they didn't tell Kennedy about Track 2, how did Hoover find out?
Well, one way or the other, Kent State is not good. We have to get out in front of this thing. The PR is going to murder us.

## Sir?
These kids are being manipulated by the Communists. Like Chambers and Hiss.

## No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious. Why're we stopping?
Run 'em over.

## Sir?
... \"The Beast.\" A nineteen-year-old kid. She understands the nature of \"the Beast.\" She called it a wild animal.

## Sir?
The presidency won't protect us, Bob. We're beyond politics now ...

## My God, my God! He talked to the New York Times?
Because they're not Americans.

## How?
When I met with him, he said ...

## What about the documents he promised?
No ...

## Why me?
Because Harold tests thy father's will is no reason to admire him. Let Harold's worldliness be a warning to thee, not an example.

## I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we?
Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry.

## Is it my turn?
I can't ...

## What about happiness, Mother?
Thou must find thy peace at the center, Richard. Strength in this life. Happiness in the next.

## What'd he say?
What do you think? He said in life there's no free ride.

## What'd you say?
I said I didn't need a free ride. I need a suit.

## What ... ?
Go to law school. Mom and Dad'll be able to afford it now ...

## Harold ... can I get you anything?
Relax, Dick, it's just me ... The desert's so beautiful, isn't it? I want to go home, Dick. Time to go home.

## You're not gonna quit on me, are you, Harold?
I didn't choose him as my deputy, Mr. President. You did.

## Is there something else that's bothering you, Mr. President?
You're referring, of course, to chairing the Special Operations Group as Vice President.

## What?
Mr. Castro.

## Are you tapping Kissinger?
My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.

## Is that why you and Kissinger are negotiating with the Chinese?
This is an extremely dangerous direction, Mr. President. Terrible consequences can result from such enormous errors in judgement.

## By offering Cuba to the Russians as a consolation prize?
Cuba would be a small price to pay.

## You must be familiar with my favorite poem by Yeats? \"The Second Coming\"?
No.

## What do you think this plan is, Edgar? A nuclear attack?
He's lying, Clyde. Always has. That's why Nixon's always been useful. Hold still. And take your hand off your hip.

## It's between Nixon and a Kennedy again, Edgar ... Who do you want?
... little Bobby.

## Winning?
Actually, I've just had a bit of luck.

## How about you? Are you going to win?
You should ask Bobby.

## Roselli? Johnny Roselli?
Yes. Your old friend from Cuba.

## Yeah, you do. I'd be bugging myself, Edgar ... Who'd get the tapes?
It won't. As long as I'm here.

## Injections. Even this noble sport's been fixed. Seen the guys?
They're around.

## Why, you got a customer?
The White House.

## Where'd you find him?
Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.

## So, does Tricky Dick know about this?
I won't tell him if you won't.

## Howard ... What the hell? What're you doing?
Dogs ... Season starts tomorrow. It keeps me calm. I don't like going back into the same building four times.

## Mein Kampf?
\"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk.\" Nietzsche.

## Let's get the fuck out of here, shall we, ladies?
Anything goes wrong, head for your homes, just sit tight -- you'll hear from me or Howard.

## So, what's this about, Dick?
The American people put me where I am.

## Well, goddamn. Are you threatening me, Dick?
He was, he was. We taught a class together at Harvard. But you know these back-stabbing Ivy League intellectuals, they can't ...

## I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry. What do you think?
Exactly, sir. That is your historical contribution, to lead boldly in an era of limits.

## All kinds of shit would come out. Like the Ellsberg thing. You knew about that, Henry, didn't you?
I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic.

## Can you imagine what this man would have been had he ever been loved?
Oh God, I'm going to throw up.

## Uh ... not really. You mean on my knees?
Yes. My mother used to pray ... a lot. It's been a long time since I really prayed. Let's pray, Henry; let's pray a little.

## Not at all. This is not going to leak, is it?
Don't be too proud; never be too proud to go on your knees before God.

## Secret, Mr. Chairman?
How a fat man gets so many girls.

## I was asleep, Mr. President. What can I get you?
Just ... uh ... you know.

## Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?
Yes, Mr. President.

## You don't think he was a hero?
He was a politician.

## Did you cry when he died?
Yes.

## Why?
I don't know. He made me see the stars ...

## How did he do that? All those kids ... Why do they hate me so much?
I must say you look very good, Mr. Chairman.

## You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
I came down here to close a deal for Studebaker.

## So ... how's the food over there in China, Mr. Nixon?
Free, if you're the president.

## What are you going to do about this Allende fellow nationalizing our businesses in Chile? You gonna send Kissinger down there?
We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list.

## How about Kissinger along with him?
Kissinger's misunderstood. He pretends to be a liberal for his Establishment friends, but he's even tougher than I am ...

## The lie?
And Dick beat the shit out of them.

## Talks all day, too! How the hell can you put up with her, John?
What the hell -- I love her. And she's great in bed.

## How many?
Four. Two boys. Two girls. And eight wounded.

## You all right?
My brother Harold was about the same age as those kids, John. Tuberculosis got him.

## Where you from?
Syracuse.

## ... I don't really know you yet, Sandy ... What do you like? I mean, what kind of clothes do you like? Do you like blue ... red?
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...

## What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
I like jazz ...

## Uh, is your mother ... still alive?
Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...

## She must be very attractive. Would she like an autograph? She might remember me ... Where's Trini?
We didn't come here to talk about football. We came here to end the war.

## But what am I telling the press about Kent State?
Tell 'em what you like; they'll never understand it anyway.

## Sir?
Shit, plenty of people did their best writing in prison. Gandhi, Lenin ...

## What's in there?
POWs. And their families.

## Sir?
Of them.

## You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?
No. I'm not going to listen to any more speeches ever again.

## What are you saying? What are you talking about?
I want a divorce.

## My God -- divorce? What about the girls?
The girls will grow up. They only know you from television anyway.

## Buddy, look at me ... just look at me. Do you really want me to quit?
We can be happy. We really can. We love you, Dick. The girls and I...

## If I stop ... there'll be no more talk of divorce?
I'll do it. No more.

## Are you serious?
Yeah ... I'm out.

## Is that the truth?
I'll never run again. I promise.

## Were you planning to tell me?
We ... haven't announced anything ... uh ...

## Do you really want this, Dick?
This. Above all.

## You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
And then you'll be happy?

## Can I just ask for one thing?
Anything.

## Hi, Buddy. What are you doing in here?
I've missed you.

## Are you okay?
Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together? Just the two of us.

## You personally?
Sometimes I think that's what you want.

## How am I going to break this to Bob Hope?
Not for the Pentagon it isn't. I'm kissing Mao's ass. And the press is gonna find some way to shaft Nixon on this one.

## When?
Tomorrow.

## Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling. But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?
No.

## And what am I doing?
I wish I knew. You're hiding.

## Hiding what?
I'm the only left, Dick. If you don't talk to me, you ...

## Why didn't you?
You can't expect me to explain that to you.

## Repartee, Dick -- very good. Hey, I feel ten years younger! It makes a helluva difference, let me tell ya! How's the lawyer life?
Never made so much money in my life. But my upbringing doesn't allow me to enjoy it. I did get to argue a case before the Supreme Court.

## Won or lost?
Lost.

## To what?
Write. You know, a book. I'm calling it \"Six Crises.\" It's a good thing, Rocky -- take some time off to write.

## The \"crises\"?
\"Checkers\" of course, Hiss, Ike's heart attack, Venezuela, the Kitchen Debate, and Kennedy.

## Whatcha mean by that?
Some say you are, Rocky.

## You heard my -- you havin' fun with me?
What give you that idea. I seen one of the cats heard it.

## But -- how'd you know it was mine?
I deduced it. Once you walked in.

## How many a those things you got now?
Cats? Several. Wal. Depends what you mean by got. Some are half-wild, and some are just outlaws.

## How you been, Ellis?
You lookin' at it. I got to say you look older.

## Want a cup?
Predate it.

## How fresh is this coffee?
I generally make a fresh pot ever week even if there's some left over.

## What would you a done if he'd been released?
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.

## How come're you doin that?
I don't know. I feel overmatched.

## When did he die?
Nineteen zero and nine.

## No ID in her room?
Not hardly nothin' in her room. And that establishment was no stickler on registration. Well...

## No money in his room there?
Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.

## Strolls right back into a crime scene. Who would do such a thing? How do you defend against it?
Don't know why I did. I told you, I don't know where he is.

## You ain't heard from him?
No I ain't.

## Nothin'?
Not word one.

## Would you tell me if you had?
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.

## Who's he in trouble with then?
Some pretty bad people.

## Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff?
I don't know. My mind wanders.

## If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
Yes ma'am, I do.

## Does that look to you like about a '77 Ford, Wendell?
It could be.

## The old boy shot by the highway?
That's very linear Sheriff.

## You sure?
Oh, I'm more than sure. Anything happens to Loretta's horse I can tell you right now you don't wanna be the party that was aboard.

## Llewelyn Moss?
That's the boy.

## You figure him for a dope runner?
Yes, appears to have been a glitch or two.

## What calibers you got there, Sheriff?
Nine millimeter. Couple of .45 ACP's.

## ...How come do you reckon the coyotes ain't been at 'em?
I don't know...

## We goin' in?
Gun out and up.

## What about yours?
I'm hidin' behind you.

## That from the lock?
Probably must be.

## So when was he here?
I don't know. Oh.

## Sheriff?
Sheriff, that's aggravating.

## You think this boy Moss has got any notion of the sorts of sons of bitches that are huntin' him?
I don't know. He ought to...

## What was the bullet?
Wasn't no bullet.

## Wasn't no bullet?
Yessir. Wasn't none.

## Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife?
Sir, I don't want to picture that.

## I don't know. Any new bodies accumulated out there?
No sir.

## Now, Wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock?
Yessir. It was punched out.

## You gonna drive out there?
No, that's the only thing I would've looked for. And it sounds like these boys died of natural causes.

## How's that, Sheriff?
Natural to the line of work they was in.

## That DEA agent called again. You don't want to talk to him?
I'm goin' to try and keep from it as much as I can.

## You want me to wait til you've quit the building?
Yes I do. You don't want to lie without what it's absolutely necessary.

## ...What is it that Torbert says? About truth and justice?
We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that.

## ...How'd you sleep?
I don't know. Had dreams.

## Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
Well they always is to the party concerned.

## You gave your word?
To your husband.

## That don't make sense. You gave your word to my husband to kill me?
Your husband had the opportunity to remove you from harm's way. Instead, he used you to try to save himself.

## What's in the satchel?
It's full a money.

## ...Where'd you get the pistol?
At the gettin' place.

## Did you buy that gun?
No. I found it.

## What'd you give for that thing?
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.

## What're you doin', baby?
Goin' out.

## Goin' where?
Somethin' I forgot to do. I'll be back.

## What're you goin' to do?
...If I don't come back tell Mother I love her.

## Why would we go to Odessa?
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.

## Well -- how come?
So... for how long do we have to...

## What'm I supposed to tell Mama?
Try standin' in the door and hollerin, Mama I'm home.

## Why all the way to Del Rio?
I'm gonna borrow a car. From Eldon.

## You can't afford one?
Don't wanna register it. I'll call you in a couple days.

## Promise?
Yes I do.

## You are comin back, ain't ya?
I shall return.

## Llewelyn?
Hey.

## What makes you say that?
I can hear it in your voice.

## Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother?
She'll be all right.

## She'll be all right?
We don't have to do this. I'm a daytrader. I could just go home.

## Why would I let you do that?
I know where the money is.

## You mean the nature of this conversation?
I mean the nature of you.

## Yessir?
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.

## Did you go up to his trailer?
Yes I did.

## Where does he work?
I can't say.

## Where does he work?
Sir I ain't at liberty to give out no information about our residents.

## Where does he work?
Did you not hear me? We can't give out no information.

## Is Llewelyn there?
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.

## What's this about?
Step out of the car please, sir.

## ...Where's the transponder?
In the truck. I'll get it.

## ...You getting anything on this?
Not a bleep.

## How'd you find it?
No me mate.

## You from around here?
What airport would you use.

## Huh? Airport or airstrip?
Airport.

## Well -- where ya goin'?
I don't know.

## I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going?
Why would I care where you're going.

## Do you know where I'm going?
...I know where you are.

## You're in the hospital across the river. But that's not where I'm going. Do you know where I'm going?
Yeah. I know where you're going.

## CHAIR ...Me?
Yes.

## How much?
Sixty-nine cent.

## What way would that be?
I seen you was from Dallas.

## What business is it of yours where I'm from, friendo?
I didn't mean nothin' by it.

## Will there be anything else?
You already asked me that.

## What time do you close?
Now. We close now.

## Sir?
I said you don't know what you're talking about.

## Sir?
Yes I do.

## You've lived here all your life?
This was my wife's father's place. Originally.

## Sir?
The most. You ever lost. On a coin toss.

## Call it?
Yes.

## For what?
Just call it.

## Yes you did. You been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin?
No.

## How's that?
You stand to win everything. Call it.

## Sir?
Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter.

## ...Where you want me to put it?
Anywhere not in your pocket. Or it'll get mixed in with the others and become just a coin. Which it is.

## You already have the tent?
Somethin' like that.

## What kind of tent?
The kind with the most poles.

## Let me have that one. Where's the nearest hardware store?
One room, one night.

## You on all night?
Yessir, be here til ten tomorrow morning.

## You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?
No sir, it's unusual.

## What room?
Just drive me around. I want to see if someone's here.

## You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
No sir but you struck me as a man who wouldn't want to waste a chair. I remember dates. Names. Numbers. I saw him on November 28th.

## I'd just like to know your opinion of him. In general. Just how dangerous is he?
He killed three men in a motel in Del Rio yesterday. And two others at that colossal goatfuck out in the desert.

## You seem pretty sure of yourself. You've led something of a charmed life haven't you Mr. Wells?
...I'm wondering...

## Can I get my parking ticket validated?
...An attempt at humor, I suppose.

## The what?
The option.

## You want to change rooms?
No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.

## Uh-huh.You got a map of the rooms?
What about one forty-two.

## Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
Half.

## What else then?
Lookin' for what's comin'.

## What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
I don't think that's how I would describe him.

## How would you describe him?
I guess I'd say... that he doesn't have a sense of humor. His name is Chigurh.

## Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
I know how he found me.

## ...What do you do?
I'm retired.

## What did you do?
I'm a welder.

## Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
Any of it. If it can be welded I can weld it.

## Cast iron?
Yes.

## Were you in Nam?
Yeah. I was in Nam.

## So what does that make me? Your buddy?
Look. You need to give me the money. I've got no other reason to protect you.

## Why would he go to Odessa?
To kill your wife.

## ...You didn't take the product, did you?
What product.

## If I was cuttin' deals, why wouldn't I go deal with this guy Chigurh?
He don't talk as much as you, I give him points for that.

## Who do you think gets through this gate into the United States of America?
I don't know. American citizens.

## Some American citizens. Who do you think decides?
You do, I reckon.

## That is correct. And how do I decide?
I don't know.

## Are you jackin' with me?
No sir.

## Are you in the service?
No sir. I'm a veteran.

## Nam?
Yes sir. Two tours.

## How is she?
She's in a kind of shock. I see all the signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms.

## Could I have that in American?
It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.

## No... Friends from the diner maybe?
Well, you should find out. She keeps talking about them...

## Hey, Sheriff. How's everything?
Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.

## Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?
They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.

## Did you send anyone out there?
You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.

## Yeah?
You said a woman couldn't have done it.

## What the hell do you want?... Hey, Sue Ann, what's up?
We think we know where Betty is.

## Ah, shit... Do I have to hear this now?
I see you're sticking to the diet Betty put you on...

## Why do I need to see this? Did he ask you to...?
Listen! I saw 'Chloe' and 'Lonnie' on T.V. They're television characters.

## Well, do something, then, damnit!
She said she was in Arizona, did she?

## Oww... Did you have to make these things so tight?
No, I didn't have to.

## Little place called \"Williams,\" why?
I know plenty.

## No, I was just... How you doing?
Great. Good. Content...

## They're fine... you miss it?
You must be joking.

## Hmm. So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...

## Who are these idiots?
This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...

## Do you know who I am?
...I... I know what you are.

## You really... didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing, did you?
I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.

## So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify? Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.

## ...well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here?
...to see you.

## I am?
Sure. You could probably have any thing you wanted... somebody as beautiful and stylish as yourself, and you don't even realize it.

## ...what're you saying?
When a Roman general knew a battle was lost, he'd throw himself on his sword.

## Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.

## So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?
I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...

## Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted... I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?
I don't think I am.

## You can start tomorrow. And don't say a word about this to anyone. Is that issue?
Umm... yes. Back home.

## Did you watch it yet?
Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...

## No... what about your sister?
I can't ask her again -- Nathan, stop it! Jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- I feel terrible, hon.

## Maroon. I stole it.
Aahhh... So what color is it?

## What?
He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.

## Are you and Larry happy?
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.

## All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
All the time...

## Something bad happened to Del and me, didn't it?
Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.

## What are you talking about?
Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick, but I need to do this.

## Do what?
I gotta go.

## ...of course you do. You don't remember me?
I take it I should. I'm sorry.

## I beg your pardon?
That's very kind of you.

## I don't know. Why do you keep calling me George?
I guess we all did. You know, I didn't marry Leslie because I loved her. I married her to forget you...

## Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
You're late, Eric.

## She's a good person to know. So where did you study again?
Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...

## What happened when you were twelve?
Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...

## I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
Of course.

## She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men... So where are we going?
Well, first I thought Patina, and then the Ivy, but then I thought of somewhere a little more romantic. Like my place.

## Didn't I?
No, I would have remembered that name. The only Stella I ever knew was a parrot. Was this before Leslie? Before us?...

## I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
Yes... maybe it was.

## Ad lib?
In fact, I want you to ad lib, that's the magic I'm after. I wanna give a whole new feel to the show.

## David, I don't... Can we talk privately for a second?
Stop calling me David. We're on set, for Christ's sake, you don't have to call me David here.

## Why am I doing this to you? Isn't this what you wanted?
What do you mean? What did I do to you...

## Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't...
Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...?

## You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?
No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I... ...I'm sorry.

## Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...

## No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...

## Or the vitamins? Or the...?
I got you, Del...

## Oh, I know. So, who're these clients?
Couple 'a guys in from outta town. They want to see the new LeSabres.

## Well, are you gonna answer me? What'd you come here for?
I came for love...

## You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.

## That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
I don't know.

## I'm great, good, content. What happened to your arm, Roy?
Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few...

## What're you doing here, Roy?
Yes.

## You did? Was it anyone that you...?
It was Chloe...

## He's a prick. Merle?... You're a prick.
What's the matter here?

## So you're into \"Reason,\" too? Finally, someone civilized! I'm Ellen, what can I get you?
Hi, I'm Betty. I'll take a Miller, if you got it...

## Where you headed, Betty?
Los Angeles, California.

## Did you love it?
Sure I loved it! It was great.

## Really?
I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop...

## Nice move. Cedars Sinai?
No. Loma Vista.

## What's his real name?
Dr. David Ravell.

## You mean... George McCord, the actor?
No, I mean David Ravell. He's a surgeon.

## Piss off, Merle. So how you gonna find him, Betty?
I'll go to the Hospital.

## Like Rome?
Worse.

## Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
I married a car salesman.

## I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
...did I win some contest?

## So why'd you come to L.A.?
I came for love. My fianc is here.

## David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?
No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.

## The one you were telling me about?
It's lovely... I really like your aquarium.

## The Five?
Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.

## Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?

## Guess who I saw today.
How many men have I talked to?

## Who?
Doctor David Ravell.

## This is crazy. I come home, you go to your room. You go in the kitchen, I go to my room. It's stupid.
If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?

## So what do you say? Can we be friends?
...okay.

## What are those for?
Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...

## Looking for someone?
You never know who you'll see.

## Were you with him this whole time?
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...

## Does he know you think he's real?
He is real.

## Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?
Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...

## No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
To a party in the Hollywood Hills.

## Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world?
Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.

## This isn't fair, you know. Do you always get what you want?
No, almost never.

## Are you sure I can borrow this?
No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...

## Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?
You should have a little faith in people.

## Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
All the time. It's always \"Loma Vista\" this, \"Loma Vista\" that.

## Oh, he does that. It's this silly game he plays. Half the people who know him call him George.
Rosa, so you've met David?

## What are you doing?
I'm going back to... I need to... I don't know.

## Where are you going?
I have to leave now.

## What?! That you had something to do with it?
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...

## Lonnie, it's a complex procedure. Why don't you observe?
I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.

## What can I do for you, gentlemen?
How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty...

## Good.
More than you know. Is there anything else?

## What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?
Georgia. In case I didn't tell you, it's cash only, gentlemen.

## Huh?
Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis -- they're all losers in my book.

## The fuck you talking about?
Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.

## Really. And where was that, old man?
Andersonville. They did horrible things to men there...

## I like this. I like doing business in the home. It's cozy... Who's birthday?
Ahh... my wife's.

## If we're for real?
You don't exactly look like drug dealers.

## What do you mean?
It's a small town, man. I never should have left Omaha. People here think small. They act small. They're a bunch of dumb fucks.

## Of what?
I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.

## You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
No...

## Hmmmm. \"Five Stars,\" huh? Is that stupid, Wesley?
You did not just say \"Injuns,\" Del.

## I... I don't know...
Like what?

## My socks?
Relax, we brought the cash.

## I'm just curious. Can't you give me an example?
No, that's ignorant. They just don't know any better.

## So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we?
Hell of a way to die.

## That was to get him to talk! Get rid of that thing, will you?
This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is.

## Well, why'd you shoot him?
That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out...

## What the hell does that mean? If I'd told a Ty Cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat?
It's not here. Let's go.

## You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.

## What the hell was that, another statement?
Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.

## We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here, town this size... He said he gave his wife some car as a gift, remember?
I hope you're right...

## I'd say that about torches her credibility, wouldn't you?
Yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up. She's an amateur, just like Del was.

## A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
Betty, Betty, Betty...

## Like... us?
No,... like a worthy adversary, Wesley. Like a very worthy adversary.

## Thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch. What time're they coming?
It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable.

## Half.
And then we're gonna do her right here. Right?

## What?
They paid us half. They still owe us half...

## What the hell's the matter with you?
That was a really shitty thing to do.

## How'd they describe her?
You know, blonde, thin, whatever...

## Not so fast! Slower... 'blonde, thin', yes... Did they say she had style? A kind of grace or anything?
We should go.

## No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
I said, 'No.' N-O.

## Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.

## Where? Where is she?
I'm not telling.

## What?
This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.

## So you believed the bartender. Why?
Well... I think I saw her soul.

## What doesn't?
You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...

## Don't Don't you talk about Betty like that. I don't care who she ends up being, you never use that word again. Got it?
Man, you have got to get some therapy.

## What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?
Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.

## Not her mouth... I've spent many long hours in a car with your face staring back at me. I've seen it painted on the horizon.
...but that's not what we're gonna do, is it?

## What's wrong with you?
This is Betty at twelve.

## What do you mean?
If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.

## ...and how long did she work here?
Oh, five years, give or take.

## Hmm... you two in high school together?
Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite. Anyway, she's been with us awhile.

## I see. May I?
If it helps bring her back, be my guest...

## What'd you get her?
Huh? Oh, umm, a car. So, to a successful transaction...

## Isn't that the point?
Yeah, well, I don't have time to screw around. I got buyers in Dallas, Houston and Vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up.

## Really?
Funny, that's just what I was thinking...

## No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy? Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.

## I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
I'll think about it.

## \"Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?\" Remember?
...yeah.

## What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who...
What the hell's going on?

## That's not a bad idea. How many episodes before he comes back?
Jesus, don't do that! If it gets around that you fired me, I'll never land a pilot.

## ...what kinda car's Jasmine drive?
Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.

## Yeah? The sport utility?
Uh-huh.

## Damn, that's sweet... She really that good-looking in person?
Better.

## Hey, can you sneak me on the lot?
Sure.

## Would you say she was ambitious?
You've got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone. That's not our Betty...

## ...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
Because it ain't natural, young man.

## Yeah. Why, you know him?
Know him? We were gonna get married! He was gonna leave his wife for me! Fuck!!...

## What do you think my father would do if I told him I didn't want to be a lawyer anymore?
Probably the same thing my mom would do if I got engaged... have a heart attack.

## So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name?
So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.

## Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
David Ravell.

## God, that sounds so familiar. Ravell, Ravell... where's he out of?
Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air.

## Did Chloe crack?
Totally. She came apart like a house of cards. They dropped the charges...

## Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?
She's a lesbian.

## I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.

## I see. Did Chloe testify?
I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...

## Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.

## Once again we find ourselves in agreement. What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?
Thankee boys for throwin' in that fricasee. I'm a man a large appetite and even with lunch under my belt I was feeling a mite peckish.

## How ya been, Wash? Been what, twelve, thirteen year'n?
We ain't gonna make it walkin'.

## You got light fingers, Everett. Gopher?
Yeah, it stinks in that ol' barn.

## I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.
What about you, Everett? What'd you have in mind when you stoled it in the first place?

## ...but try getting a decent hair jelly.
Good Lord, what do we do?

## Gopher, Everett?
And no transmission belt for two weeks neither.

## What'd the devil give you for your soul, Tommy?
Five... hunnert... thousand... each.

## Where's Tommy?
Yeah, look at me.

## Now wuddya suppose is eatin' George?
Whuhh...

## Pete have a brother?
Not that I'm aware.

## Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the subjective! You ever been with a woman?
Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that.

## So - where's all the money from your armored-car job?
I never knocked over any armored- car. I was sent up for practicing law without a license.

## What sat mean exactly, Everett?
Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne so to speak.

## Is the marriage off then, Miz Wharvey?
We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.

## What's his name again?
Campaign manager? Waldrip.

## Where's your ring, honey?
Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.

## - in the gods - Huh?
That's not my ring.

## How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car?
Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash.

## Well that all depends. You boys do Negro songs?
Sir, we are Negroes. All except our a-cump- uh, company-accompluh- uh, the fella that plays the gui-tar.

## Well he's the reform candidate, Daddy.
Now what can I do you for, Mister French?

## ...Yeah?
Well people like that reform. Maybe we should get us some.

## You, Zack?
Yes, Sir.

## How was the flight? They take care of you okay? Long way from Norfolk, isn't it?
Okay, okay. You win.

## So what're you doing in Seattle?
Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away.

## You... in the Navy?
That's right. I'm on my way over to this officer school in Port Ranier.

## Why?
To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in the world. You gotta come and visit me. I'm only a couple hours away.

## Who gave you this idea?
Nobody. It just came to me.

## Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
I don't know. That's just how it sounded. Well, I'll see you.

## Hey, what did you want? A lot of fatherly bullshit? A big pat on the back?
From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present.

## Who's that?
Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.

## Better watch out for that kind, Zackie. You know what they call 'em, don't ya?
Naw. That's over with.

## Ever heard of knocking, mayo?
Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night. Survival of the fittest.

## The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
You got it, Sweet Pea. Nice boonies, Seeger.

## Esther, do you think she's using... ...birth control?
Yes, Joe.

## When did this happen?
A long time ago.

## He doesn't mean anything by it, Zack. Do you, Joe?
I don't mean anything by it.

## How did you slip into this program, Mayo? I didn't know the Navy was so hard up. You got an injury there, Mayo?
Not exactly, sir.

## That's a lie, Mayo. You've gone through a lot worse, haven't you?
I don't want to do something anybody can do.

## You didn't kick him out...? Wait, didn't he tell you what he's been going through?
But you don't understand. There's this girl he's gotten pregnant and she's putting him through hell, sir.

## Hi, son.
I thought the D.I.'s were supposed to help you in this place! What kind of human being are you?

## What did you call me, boy?
I called you Sarge.

## You said, 'How're you?' I am not a 'ewe,' boy! A ewe is a female sheep, boy! Is that what you think I am, boy?
No, sir.

## Where are you from, boy?
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

## What are you tired from?
Yes, ma'am. Four long, hard weeks of sacrifice for my country... for my people... for you. But I survived.

## You been through the Dilbert Dunker yet?
Cake walk. Both my dad and my brother went through it and made it, so I know I can.

## Is your brother a flyer?
He was. He died.

## Vietnam?
Yeah.

## I sure remember Tommy. Mind if we talked about something else?
We don't have to talk at all.

## You're sure it's okay?
Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards.

## Like pick up some booze and go to a motel?
Or we could do that yeah.

## Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay?
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.

## By the way, shouldn't you have had a period by now?
I'm a little late, that's all.

## How late?
What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.

## What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
No. But that's not the only issue here, sweetheart. There's a lot more to it than that.

## What other issue is there, Sid?
My responsibility as its father, for one. I mean, if I've made you pregnant, I'd want to... do the right thing.

## ...I'd want to pay for the abortion... I'd want to be with you through the whole thing... by your side. So how late are you, Lynette?
Let's just wait and see what happens.

## I can't go like this. Can't you wait a few minutes 'til I'm ready?
No way. I'm so happy I'm about to bust. Here, honey. This is for you. It cost me my whole savings, but I said what the fuck.

## You what?
I had to, baby... I'm no aviator. I was faking it, like I was with everything else in my life... up 'til right now.

## But... but what would we do? Where would we go?
Sid, there's no baby.

## What?
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.

## That was you guys, huh?
Come on. Let's go dance.

## Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?
Great.

## What did he do? Did he do anything that was different?
Everything was different.

## He ask you out for next weekend?
No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.

## You serious about having him over?
I haven't made up my mind.

## God! I've never seen anything like that in my whole life! Did you see that guy's nose?
That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period. I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.

## And you turned him down?
Of course. I don't want no Okie from Muscogee. I can get that right here in Port Angeles.

## Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
Italian. My mom was Irish. I got her ears. But the rest is all wop.

## Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?
Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the Polack.

## Really?
Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.

## You got a girl?
No, and I'm not looking for one either.

## Yeah? Why're you here?
To meet interesting people, improve myself. You wouldn't believe the losers we got over in Port Angeles.

## Think you'll make it all the way to getting your wings?
Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.

## Where'd you learn to fight like that?
I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.

## What do you want, Paula? What do you really want?
To have a good time with you until you have to go.

## That's it?
Zack, I dare you not to fall in love with me. I ain't gonna get serious with you, no way. But how can you resist me? I'm like candy.

## Zack, when you're through with a girl, what do you do? Do you say something or do you just... disappear?
I've never had a girl.

## Want me to get a towel?
I'll get it if you want.

## What's stopping you?
That's no excuse for not going after what you want.

## Does it still hurt?
Naw. You're alone in this world no matter what kinda folks or background you had. Nothing hurts, pard, once you got that one down.

## What's the matter?
Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula.

## Hey, will you just leave me alone?
Zack, I don't know if I want to do that...

## Hey, what about Sunday dinner? When're you gonna let me know?
When I'm good and ready.

## Are those for me?
No, they're for your mom.

## So, after you graduate you go on to basic flight, right? Is that in Pensacola?
Yeah, then if I get jets, it's on to Beeville, Texas.

## No. Is that what you want?
Some day. When I'm sure I can do a better job of it than my folks.

## What would you do differently?
For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with.

## Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.

## Your real father was an Officer candidate like me?
Twenty-two years ago.

## So?
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.

## I'd like to come with you.
Why'd he do it?

## Why?
Because he's my friend, too.

## He said it's up to us and I got here first, didn't I?
Two bucks a buckle, Perryman. Look at that shine! Boonies'll cost you five.

## Hey, man, is the piss-ass money you're making off this worth the risk of getting us all kicked out of here on an honor violation?
I don't notice anyone else complaining.

## Hey, do you guys ever... feel like you don't belong here...?
Yeah. All week long.

## He said he grew up poor?
The kid on the windy side of the baker's window. That's how he put it.

## Think there's any truth to what he was saying about those girls? Is that still going on?
Jets.

## Not if you make it worth my while. How about free boonies for the duration?
You told us it would grow out an inch.

## You okay?
Sure.

## Hey, you guys still awake?
Yeah.

## What's the matter, Sweet Pea. Foley finally starting to get to you?
Naw.

## That isn't true, is it?
A little.

## I kid you not, Mayo, I am in love. We must've set a new indoor record today. You want to know how many times we did it?
You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.

## I'm not your folks, man. You love this... Susan?
She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her.

## Calm down, Sweet Pea. She seen a doctor?
No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.

## But she expects you to marry her?
She said it was up to me. If I don't, she'll go off and have the baby on her own somewhere.

## I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?
Not if she won't even talk about an abortion.

## Do you know that for sure?
It's mine.

## Sid, what happened?
I don't know... I felt like... like I was suffocating... Christ, Zack... I was so scared... so godddamn scared...

## What?
A woman and a little girl, both asleep upstairs.

## What if she called the cops?
She didn't.

## What the fuck is funny about this?
God.

## What? What do you want me to do?
What do you think? Get us into that room.

## You got an idea?
Yeah. Yeah, I got an idea. I gotta check something.

## The hell does she want?
I don't know, she keeps screamin' the same thing over and over.

## Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a little more, and your mom'll give it to you. You can wait a half hour, can't you?
Yeah. She can. She's fine, she's just like, tired, she's gotta rest. You rest, Kid. Half an hour.

## -- posed to mean?
You're here with me, you're already on the hook for one. Buy one, you get the rest for the same price. You know that.

## The walls are steel, right?
Fourteen business days. Escrow is always business days.

## I mean, right? Isn't it?
You're an idiot.

## Who is this guy?
Raoul is cool. That's all you need to know.

## Daddy's not coming back, she's in the middle of a divorce, it's just the two of them. We're okay, here. We can do this, right?
Forty-five minutes. That's all you said you need. That's like nothing.

## Raoul, what in God's name do we do if she has a gun?
Asshole.

## Where did you get this clown?
I met him at the tables, same as you. And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.

## The fuck did you bring a gun for?
It's still a good plan. It's just... got a twist.

## Okay, fuckball, you think. What are we gonna do?
She said she did.

## Yes. Yes, it's all terrible ironic and amusing. You fuck. Now how are you gonna get us into that room?
Can't. Whole point. Can't get in the room.

## Junior, you gigantic idiot, how are we supposed to get into the room if they pass out?
Cell phone.

## Jesus, what was I thinking?
Hey man, after all we went through I am not walking out when we're this close.

## What about us?
We're not leaving. I'm getting in that room, and I'm opening that safe.

## Huh?
Bout four o'clock.

## What do you want?
We'd like to come in.

## Stop asking me that. I'm fine. Who called you?
You don't look so good.

## Master closet.
May I ask what the rest of that sentence was going to be?

## Will they take asking price? I need a two week escrow and I'm already approved for the loan.
Could the child please stop that?

## A what?
A safe room. An inner sanctum. A castle keep, in medieval times.

## It's okay, Raoul.
Push that button for me, will you?

## It's just the woman and the kid?
Cut it back a little bit.

## How many more do we have after this?
None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.

## I don't know, doesn't that corner seem funny to you?
Makes me nervous.

## Ever read any Poe?
I don't think so, but I love her album.

## Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with this room, did he?
Open the door.

## Got us in here, didn't I?
Shoulda got an apartment.

## What do they want?
I don't know. Rob us. I don't know.

## What do we do?
Wait.

## What if they get in here?
They can't. They can't get in here. No. They can't.

## Feel okay?
Yeah.

## Shaky?
Nope.

## Chills?
No, I told you, they can't. It's not a possibility.

## Are you freaking out?
Little bit. Yeah.

## Small space?
Don't though.

## I don't know, why?
Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot.

## Do it.
Where'd you learn S.O.S.?

## What are you doing?
I saw something, I saw...

## Why?
I was trying not to tell you...

## What?
I'm dizzy and thirsty.

## Hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign. Did you see any sugar in here? Any candy bars, anything sweet?
Huh uh.

## What if I keep dropping?
Not an option.

## What if I spazz out?
No biggie, we've been through it a dozen times, I just jab you with the Glucogen.

## Where is the Glucogen?
Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.

## Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?
Okay.

## What?!? Don't tell me you're buying this?
Those ain't cops.

## And they sure ain't from the neighborhood. Figure Sabu's in there?
Alma I told you to...

## Okay now, er, Huey, so what's your telephone number?
I have confirmed to you my address, that's all I'm required to by law to do. We have broken no law.

## What are you doing with the gun?
What are doing with yours?.

## Well... is it loaded?
I tell you \"officer\", it wasn't...

## You got six months to donate to the party, Bobby?
You know it brother.

## No more police brutality! WHAT DO WE WANT?
Yeah... Sounds like the Constitution to me. With a little of the Bill of Rights thrown in...

## Inspector Brimmer, this is no joke During your surveillance have you seen any outside agitators? Professorial types? Communists?
No. I've seen Black men handing out bags of food. Having meetings. Patrolling the neighborhood. Having more meetings. They ain't...

## Like?
Like, you Inspector Brimmer are not going to be sitting in your car anymore. I think it's time for a more active type of involvement.

## Brimmer! Could you come in here please?
Just hold on a god damn minute. I...

## So... we understand each other Judge?
Yeah.

## Why didn't you tell us about the party you boys were planning at the capitol?
Shit man. It was... you know spontaneous.

## What's with you?
Get out of the fucking car.

## Yeah, it's me.
What are you crazy?

## Judge, calm down.
Judge, hold on, is your phone safe?

## Hey... what the hell you doing?
I ain't gonna shoot you Judge. Look... it's over. Just run away. Get out. Stay away from Oakland. Cause it's gone... it's gone.

## Who? I mean besides the FBI?
You know that's bullshit.

## Can't... they're having a PE meeting at Headquarters tonight, come on down. Check it out.
Hey, this what they got you doing now?

## Man, did you see Huey down on Grove street? All up on that cop, that was beautiful.
PE? What? You guys doing gym class?

## You got it. Berkeley?
No, Panther Headquarters. Least that way we could hang out more like we used to.

## Hey, it's the invisible man. Brother where you been?
Cy... I ain't even sure.

## Cy... Cy... Oh shit man... who did this to you. Was it the pigs?
N... N...... Not... Oh.

## Can you make a deal with them?
Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.

## You want me to put a man on it?
That would be an excellent start. Tell him to keep a low profile.

## Are you finished?
Jesus...

## And did you witness the shoot-out?
Yes sir, I did.

## From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
No sir he didn't.

## Huh, well then... did someone else start shooting?
I refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me.

## Did you shoot the officers in question?
Again I'll take the fifth amendment on that question.

## Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
Well, then we're going to take that power away from those bastards.

## Black people getting uppity, feeding their children breakfast, taking their destiny into their own hands. What's this world coming to?
C'mon let's...

## That's right. We'd be proud to provide as escort for Malcolm's widow. How many men you got?
Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it. Men? Well we can spare six for security...

## You were. infantry right?
Yeah.

## So what's the deal?
Freedom... We're just gonna test some of the words in that law book.

## You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?
Yeah... let me think about it.

## Welcome brother, have you decided to get down with us?
I'm down.

## Mind if I ask you something? Why'd you put up with shit like that for someone else's war?
Whatever you need, I'll be there.

## Me? You've got a whole lot of other folks signing up. Why me?
You fit the profile, Brother. You look exactly like the kind of nigger they think they can trust...

## What's the pig's name?
Brimmer.

## Yeah... I guess. Any of other Panthers know about this?
Man, this shit's pretty thick.

## Huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?
Like the manual says, \"Information is...

## But nothing... you do live here don't you?
Yeah, I do.

## And who is we?
Shit, we made him get his moms to give permission before he could sign up.

## Busted firing pin. You want only the legal stuff right?
Just the legit shit.

## Huh?
He had a feeling you'd be coming by.

## What? You don't like to see a traitor get hurt? I wonder why that is?
If you got something to say, say it.

## What are you saying?
The pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. Huey wants us to stop them.

## Chickenshits? What you bring your buddies with you?
Not really. Gimme the keys for the trunk.

## You supposed to be a wounded vet, Motherfucka. What you do in 'Nam anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?
All of the above, man... And then some.

## Rose, what the hell you doing here?
Just come for the food, man. Ain't quite sure what their bag is but...

## This cool the heat off you any?
I don't know. But I'm sure I'll find out. Rose, you did me solid.

## Unh... Unh Man... I don't take no money from friends that need help. Fuck no. What do you think I am a bum?
Not at all. I'll catch you later.

## What?
It was Sabu killed Cy.

## Rose?
Yeah... Look man, what I gotta say. It's just you, me and the rats, right? Alright... well... Sabu's back.

## I saw. I saw that big one hit that police man. Saw 'em drag you off too. They take you to jail?
Yeah.

## You meet those friends of yours in jail too?
Yes... No... Mom it's not like you think. They're alright. There out there trying to do something.

## You believe that?
I don't know. I really don't.

## Do you think Frances with an \"e\" is too manly a name for a girl?
No.

## Do you think Francis with an \"i\" is too womanly a name for a boy?
No.

## When?
Late summer.

## You call that a compliment?
It's a start.

## You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?
I expect to try.

## It worked. How many men can you raise?
I say we drink the wine, shoot the dogs, and use the papers for musket wadding.

## Am I one of that sort?
You're the worst of that sort. You're the sort that gives that sort a bad name.

## Well?
I've just been inside the mind of a genius. Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.

## What do you mean, old and ugly?
You got me beat on both accounts.

## You don't know him very well, do you?
He's my father.

## I know him well enough?
Don't fault him for having grown up on the frontier. It was a harder time and a harder place than you know.

## How did this... how did I let this happen?
You couldn't have known.

## Excuse me?
I said, I'm not my sister.

## Do you?
Of course, I do.

## What unit?
First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.

## Who cared for your wounds?
We did.

## With a lace table cloth?
My boys... my boys... you seem to have been well fed. Thank you for that, Colonel.

## Shall we proceed?
I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.

## Oh?
I served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War.

## Oh. Very well, then. Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?
Unless you would like to claim aggrieved status.

## Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children?
That is a separate issue.

## Sir?
You have eighteen of my men. I want them back.

## Their names, ranks and posts?
My harrier. Join us, Colonel.

## Are you going to meet with him?
Most certainly. Arrange it.

## How can we end this madness?
Difficult, sir. This is, as you pointed out, a civil war.

## Do you see that, Colonel?
Unless I'm dreaming, I think I see irregulars at their center.

## Thank you. How's the spotted one's milk?
The New York and Rhode Island assemblies have been dissolved...

## Anything about the convention in Philadelphia?
Poor Richard says they'll make a Declaration of Independence by July.

## What news?
The British army is barricaded in Boston. Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army.

## Is that why the Assembly was convened?
Yes. He seeks a levy of troops and money.

## And the Governor?
He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body.

## Do you intend to enlist without my permission?
Yes.

## Not yet. What happened?
I have to get these dispatches to Hillsboro.

## What now, sir?
We put out the word. We'll start along the south side of the Santee...

## Is that so?
Yes, sir. My father taught me.

## Did your father teach you humility?
He tried. It didn't take.

## Is it?
If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself.

## How old are you?
You know how old I am.

## Flanking riders?
I didn't see any.

## Father?
Pride is his weakness.

## Gabriel? Are you asleep?
We're low on salt. I should go to Pembroke and get some.

## When was that? In the swamp at the expense of your men? Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family?
No...

## She spoke? Susan spoke?
Full sentences. As if she had been speaking all along.

## She said that? Oh, my Lord, she said that?
Father, there's something else I need to talk to you about.

## What?
Come with me. I'll tell you when we get there.

## Granted. Where are you going?
Cheraw Falls.

## Where?
Seven homes along the Black River so far...

## Is it her? Is Anne in there?
She is. Don't go in there.

## Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness?
You know what happened.

## And what do they know?
That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation.

## As you did at Fort Wilderness?
He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn't leave his men.

## An American nation. Colonel Lee, with your permission?
Please.

## Damn it, Francis! How in God's name do you expect to gain independence without going to war?
Harry, Harry, Harry...

## And your principles?
I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles.

## One of yours?
Gabriel.

## I recognize him now. Is he as imprudent as his father was at his age?
No, thank the Lord. He's more like his mother.

## Where is he now?
Last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up.

## Who's in command?
I am, I think.

## What are my orders?
So now Cornwallis will head north, link up with Clinton and finish off Washington.

## When?
Fall, six months at the earliest.

## You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia?
Not held, just slowed down.

## How many men does Cornwallis have under his command?
Four thousand infantry and around six hundred cavalry... ... including the Green Dragoons under Tarleton.

## How many men have we seen die?
Two. Gabriel and Thomas.

## Your son, what did you name him?
Robert. Robert E. Lee.

## How far away?
Four, five miles.

## But what about Thomas?
Leave him. Take care of William and Susan.

## For what?
For trying to impose some decency on that sort.

## How many came back?
About a hundred and twenty. Less than a third.

## He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he?
Yes, he does.

## That bad?
Worse.

## And what is the second thing?
Not yet, Thomas.

## When?
Seventeen.

## Father?
Six-pounders. Lots of them.

## Who might you be, little Miss?
I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan. At least, I used to.

## But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
You'll see soon enough, hon.

## Bite?
Ayuh.

## They do it to honor the dead, Ellen.
What if you can't read what's written on there anymore?

## Honey, Church will be fine.
Is that right, dad?

## Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
He's a ghost. But he's a good ghost.

## Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay?
For a little while.

## In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he?
Fine...except when Mom was airing Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into Grampa's study and pooped in Grampa's favorite chair.

## Is he really all right?
Yes.

## Ellie? What's wrong?
No more chocolate chip cookies.

## Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven?
At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell.

## Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose.
I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?

## Do you believe that?
I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that.

## Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
Yeah, sure.

## I'm sure you're not.
I'm not tired!

## Then why do I have to go to bed?
I swear.

## You need a glass?
Not at all.

## What were you listening to?
Allman Brothers.

## What?
The Eat A Peach album. God, they were good before drugs and bad luck caught up with them. Listen to this, Louis.

## You folks ready to go on?
Sure.

## Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies?
Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands.

## Not yet...how much further is it?
I think it is so, Ellie.

## Did you tell me Rachel took the kids back to Chicago for a few days?
Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.

## Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?
Yes.

## Going to tell Ellie?
I don't know.

## Maybe when they call I'll just tell Ellie I haven't seen the damn cat around. You know?
Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back.

## Nothing. Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
We're still not where we're going.

## What do you mean?
The place we're going is on the other side of that.

## Yes. Where are we going, Jud?
You'll see before long. Let's go.

## Is there quicksand?
Ayuh.

## Whose burying ground?
The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.

## I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right?
I guess so...but...

## You want to rest a bit before you start?
No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.

## What are those for?
Your cairn.

## Jud, why am I doing all this?
Because it's right.

## I tried to tell myself I buried him alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets Felix the Cat. But...
What did we do, Jud?

## Wouldn't wash?
Ayuh. It was the rag-man told me about the place--Stanley Bouchard. Us kids just called him Stanny B. He was half Micmac himself.

## Can I have another one?
I guess it wouldn't hurt.

## Wendigo?
You and this old Indian rag-man--

## Rachel not feeling well?
It's Ellie's cat.

## Your father-in-law packs a wallop, for an old guy. He and his wife gone back to Chicago?
No...squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them. Her and Ellie.

## I'll bite--what's the bottom of the truth, Jud?
I don't have the slightest idea. When I saw the house, this field was under four feet of snow.

## It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it.
You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you?

## Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
Do you think I didn't hear her tonight, crying as if her heart would break? Here she is thinking Church is going to die.

## Louis, are you sure?
Safe! At Port Royal. With the Royal Navy.

## What's in your head, boy?
And Jack. And the crew. Free and unharmed. If you agree ... then ... I will remain with you.

## The Pearl? Oh, that's fine. And just how do you expect this to work?
You give me the Pearl. Then I tell you who you need.

## That's your offer? You, sailing away nice and pretty with the Black Pearl, and all I have is a name?
That's right.

## I'm supposed to ... trust you?
You see, I've got this honest streak in me -- in its own way, a sort of curse. Oh, and there's the fact that you have no choice.

## You left me on a desert island -- what worse can you do?
Blast you! I'll throw you in prison.

## What -- you don't have the medallion?
That fool woman took it. You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.

## So how did you get off that island, anyway?
You can go to your grave not knowing.

## Why don't I want to do this?
Because, right about now, the H.M.S. Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor.

## What're you suggesting?
Like after you've killed ... Every ... Last ... One ... of Norrington's men.

## There's ... another exit?
Aye, for us there is.

## So what now, Jack Sparrow? Are we to be two immortals, locked in epic battle until the trumpets of Judgement Day?
Or you could surrender.

## Now?
Now. No, don't kill him.

## Do you believe him?
No. But him I believe. He us genuinely angry.

## My apologies, miss. As you were saying, before you were so rudely interrupted?
Captain Barbossa ... I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.

## You have a name, missy?
Elizabeth -- Turner. I'm a maid in the governor's household.

## And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that? A family heirloom, perhaps?
Of course. I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.

## Maid or not, it fits you.
Can I trust you?

## Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
Now, none of that. Please dig in.

## Then why aren't you eating?
Would that I could.

## Do you not know what this is, then?
It's a pirate medallion.

## The curse drove you to gather this?
He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.

## I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
Not as a condition -- a request.

## What?
I know where your heart truly lies.

## Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?
Yes -- yes.

## Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?
Although ... I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today.

## Ceremony?
Captain Norrington's promotion ceremony.

## Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
At least once more, Miss Swann. As always.

## Why would my father send this to me?
To keep it away from them? No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock.

## Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?
You are despicable.

## Has it changed since the last time you were here?
The trees are taller.

## What? What's wrong? How will this help us get off the island?
It won't. It won't, and so we won't.

## So that's it? That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow? You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.

## You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted?
Exactly.

## Aye, that'll about do it.
What's your plan?

## First -- have you found me a crew?
Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx.

## Say again?
I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it.

## Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?
That he is.

## How did you get off the island?
Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold.

## Jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crew. He was marooned on an island, left there to die.
Really? So ... what's the story on the pistol?

## How did he get off the island?
It's a signal. If we resist, it won't just be death. There'll be torture as well.

## Hands! Come about! Jackets off the cannons! We are to fire on our own ship?
Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.

## Sir! Shall I break out the cannons?
I don't think that will be necessary.

## Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh? You two weren't invited?
No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.

## What's your name?
Smith.

## Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
Captain Jack Sparrow. If you please.

## Norrington, think about it ... the Black Pearl, its captain and crew ... the last pirate threat in the Caribbean. How can you pass that up?
By remembering that I serve others, not only myself.

## They left me stranded. Twice. What have you got to lose?
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.

## You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.

## Do you think this is wise, boy? Crossing blades with a pirate?
You threatened Miss Swann.

## Who makes all these?
I do. And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.

## You need to find yourself a girl. Or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is you've found one -- but can't get her?
You cheated.

## Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?
Somewhat.

## Why ask me?
Because you're a pirate.

## And you want to turn pirate yourself?
I'd die for her.

## We're going to steal a ship? That ship?
Commandeer. We're going to commandeer a ship. Nautical term.

## My father. William Turner?
I knew him. Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.

## Oh -- did I forget to mention that?
But I survived. And I still have that single shot. It's meant for one man. My mutinous first mate--

## What's that?
Depends.

## Don't talk. These caves magnify sound. Just follow me.
On what?

## Are you certain this is the right way?
It's the right way.

## You've seen it?
Yes.

## You've seen the Black Pearl?
Yes.

## You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?
... No.

## What happened here?
An explosion in the powder magazine. Merchant vessels run heavily armed.

## Has my daughter given you an answer yet?
Until he's done.

## Mr. Sim, when you do locate him. Do not scare him off again. Just watch him. I think you can handle that. Right, Mr. Sim?
You got it, Dr. Argon.

## Have you found Dr. Bright?
No. The captain of the containment crew is closing down the main lab. He says the area has got to be evacuated.

## Something to drink, Dr. Bright?
No, thank you.

## Does that mean Oppenheimer loved the atomic bomb?
I suppose you are going to tell me where it is going.

## How do you know we're not heading in the wrong direction?
I swear to you, Argon, if you don't stop the meltdown that nanobot will be the last one I ever build.

## What are you going to do to him?
Do? Well, I suppose that depends on you.

## What did you use?
A light mixture of oxygen, dioxide, and sodium pentothal. He'll sleep, that's all.

## In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab. I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
Icky! What's happening?

## Oh no. No. We'll get her assistant. What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
Nebbleman.

## Do you think she will give us the designs?
Eventually. These things are always a matter of leverage.

## And you think O'Brien is that leverage?
That remains to be seen.

## And you still believe he's going to come here?
Based on what we know of him, that would seem inevitable.

## Do you think she loves him?
She must feel something for him. After all, she and I did create him.

## Poppy, are you in one of your moods again?
No, Icky, this is real.

## Icarus, please! This is important!
Yes. Yes, of course it is.

## Then you still love me?
Poppy, please, just tell me what you want.

## Icarus?
I promise, my dear, I will give the matter some consideration.

## Consideration?
If you honestly trust me, then you'll have to trust me.

## Can you feel it, Poppy? The presence of the moment? Can you feel the weight of its significance?
Oh yes, Icky. I can feel it.

## Did you feel that?
Well, yes. The replicators are not as active at low temperatures.

## Where did he go?
The trunk.

## Excellent. How long until the assembler tank is complete?
Dr. Makeo is working on it now, sir. I estimate at least another six hours.

## Wait, wait, can I at least have his body?
You better quit pushing me, pal.

## Aaabout...?
This morning. I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.

## A man?
Yeah. I knew him when I was still in school.

## What did he want?
I'm not sure. That's the funny thing about him. He's the kind of guy that you never know what he wants or what he might do to get it.

## Oh yeah. They were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they?
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.

## What did security say?
They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.

## The replicators?
Worse. Mrs. Argon wants to talk to you. She's waiting in the lab.

## What are you going to do?
What I've always done. As long as I'm the only one who can build the nanobot, I'm the only one who can say when it should be tested.

## There's a guard outside my door! I'm a prisoner, Nigel! Do you understand that?
Dr. Argon would say we are all prisoners.

## Is that what Argon told you?
No! Well, not those exact words.

## Nigel, can't you see he's using you?
Of course he is, but at least there isn't a security guard outside my door.

## You mean the designs for the nanobot? You think after this I'm going to give them to him?
I think that either you're going to give them to him or he's going to make you give them to him.

## Yes?
I've only been invited to her house once, but I know there is a basement lab that she uses for private research.

## What's it smell like?
Smell? Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.

## He's probably right, sir, the building is probably going to collapse under its own weight.
Like Crazy Glue?

## Daniel...
And if we evacuate, what do you want to do with O'Brien?

## When did you...?
Been out for six months now.

## Really? What have you been doing?
You know, this and that.

## Is that so?
Oh yeah. See, Susie, a man doesn't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off. Oh no. The big house does things to a man.

## The big house?
The big house.

## Do you ever wonder what happened to us, Susie?
It was a long time ago, Daniel. We were young, different people, heading in different directions. That's all.

## Sure. Can I ask you one more thing? You haven't published anything in a while. How come?
Nothing really worthwhile.

## We'll see? What does that mean?
We'll see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making Agent Orange.

## Mouse? What mouse?
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.

## What happened to it?
I don't know.

## You don't know?
It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.

## We don't?
What has happened to you is nothing compared to what is going to happen to Calumet City if we don't hurry.

## What are these?
Mostly caffeine diuretics. Help you go to the bathroom.

## Why?
The nanobot is still inside you. It's programmed to exit through the urinary tract. We need it as soon as possible, so swallow those.

## Why do we need it?
The nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste.

## That was 'simple'?
Got it.

## That was an egg?
Three days ago it was.

## What do these replicators do to people?
With enough exposure, the same thing they do to everything else.

## So right now there's little replicators spreading throughout Argon's lab?
That's right.

## Isn't it already too late then?
I think while we're waiting, we had better run some basic diagnostics on you.

## The polymerization probably synthesized into a kind of methyl- cyanoacrylate. So what's wrong?
Just giving credit where credit is due.

## Do you have something to bring me down?
No problem.

## What's wrong?
The nanobot... it's not here...

## How far can you stretch?
I don't know.

## What did you want my hair for?
Something else I want to try.

## What's that?
It's a crime fighting costume, what do you think? It's underwear, so if you lose your clothes you'll still be decent.

## That's going to fit me?
Like a glove.

## You made this out of my hair?
Sort of. We used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers.

## Did you go?
On the counter.

## Who is he?
The head shrinker at the prison.

## You didn't think I could just leave you?
I didn't know what was going to happen. I was just so worried something was going to happen to you.

## Where is it?
Argon's private lab.

## Did you think I could just leave you...?
Susie... I...

## What in the...?
Oh shit, the meltdown. It's spread to the tower.

## You mean he's polymerized, like me?
That means the nanobot is still inside him.

## What would happen if I threw him into the core?
I remember I was trying to help...

## You were looking for us?
Yeah, I have something I've been meaning to give you.

## An ass-beating. Would you like yours first, Mr. Sim?
All the different ways that I could kill you.

## The question is, are you?
That's impossible.

## Mr. Sim? Do you have him? He's alive?
Oh yeah, he's alive. Technically.

## And you have him?
We lost him.

## Can I help you, Mrs. Argon?
I spoke to Dr. Argon this morning and he remains frustrated over the loss of the original nanobot.

## Just one question. Since Dr. Argon no longer has feeling below his waist, how is it that you're still able to do your job?
I could have you fired right now.

## In fact, would it be safe to say, based on your general knowledge of this character, that he is already in the building?
Yes, he might be.

## What in the hell?
Pipe down, brain lady! And you...

## Oh, Stew and I went for a long ride. Dexter, is there any finishing school we can send him to?
Yes - Sing Sing.

## To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
Exactly.

## Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?
You don't seem to understand that this one's different. He has brains.

## Well, what else do you expect them to call you?
Dexter.

## No? Why not?
You know something, lady, if you sold life insurance, I'd go for a policy in sixty seconds.

## May I use your telephone?
Certainly. Right over there.

## What do you want?
That's considerate of you.

## Where did you get those letters?
I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo.

## I suppose you're going to print them?
No - give you another guess.

## Will you step into the library?
Sure, I'll take a chance.

## For what?
For the letters, of course.

## Really?
Yeah, I haven't figured out the plot yet, but it's laid in a Siberian village.

## I'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you.
You're a bit eccentric, aren't you?

## Why should I? We're happy, aren't we, darling?
Throw me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne.

## Look Anne, you're not serious about this, are you?
You wear them of course, silly.

## Oh, yes, of course. How do you do?
Gallagher, this is Mrs. Smith.

## Gallagher?
Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed to mention that Gallagher was a girl.

## No? What do you look upon her as?
Why, down at the office, we always look at Gallagher as - eh - just Gallagher, that's all.

## Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it?
Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however.

## Stewart! We're all waiting for you. Where's your valet?
I poisoned him.

## What are you talking about?
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.

## What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
Go downstairs, and tell them - anything. Tell them I'm not going. Tell them I'm not home.

## Stewart, would you mind telling me why you're not going?
But I don't want to meet your gang.

## Oh hello, Anne He types furiously.
Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose?

## Good morning. What does this mean?
Oh, that mob downstairs. I guess I got so interested in the play I forgot all about them.

## What's the idea, Anne?
The idea is simply this - that I want those people to leave here immediately.

## Your house?
and if it's all the same to you, I'm moving out.

## Yeah, hello. How are you?
Fine. Have a seat.

## Is that so?
Yale '21, I believe.

## Huh?
We were classmates.

## I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.
Is that so?

## So, you see how silly that rumor is?
Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.

## Oh, is that so?
I'm afraid.

## What do you want?
Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman.

## Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?
Oh boy, I'd love it.

## How's that?
Not bad - not good - but not bad. You ought to be able to fool about almost anybody.

## I bring a message from Garcia.
Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph?

## Yeah?
Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer you a job. He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune.

## I'll bite. What's the catch?
There's no catch. This is on the up and up. Of course all you have to do is just sign the article - by Anne Schuyler's Husband.

## Is there a green elephant standing beside that bwana?
Yeah.

## You're always picking on me. It took me three hours to get those little gadgets in those holes, and you screw it up in a minute. Hey, look!
With me you can always do business.

## Do you know what to do in a drawing- room?
It isn't a question of knowing what to do, it's knowing how to get in one that counts.

## Gloria Golden?
Yeah, little Gloria.

## The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
Right - for the first time this year.

## No? Well, where were you when that happened?
No, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all.

## What do I care about your mother- in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you?
Quitting? I'm not thinking about quitting.

## Is that so?
You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.

## And live on your salary, I suppose?
Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until I finish writing my play.

## What play?
My play.

## The one about the Siberian bloodhound?
Siberian bloodhound? No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.

## Araby?
I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir.

## You're my what?
Your valet, sir.

## Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'll do that for you some time. That's very sweet. Say listen, what did you say your name was?
Dawson, sir.

## Drunk, sir?
Yes. I must have been pretty much plastered if I hired a valet.

## What are you doing fooling around in here?
Miss Schuyler - I mean, Mrs. Smith - she engaged me this morning, sir.

## Are you trying to tell me that I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up?
Quite so. Quite.

## That's a lovely dress.
Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?

## Mr. Smith? Oh, you mean Ann Schuyler's husband?
Yes.

## You newspaper people have a lot of fun with him, don't you? What is it you call him - the Cinderella Man?
Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing.

## Well, well, well! Gallagher, old pal! There you are. What did you run away for?
I didn't run away.

## Sure, you ran away. Aren't you going to congratulate a guy?
Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal.

## Oh sure, we'll be happy. What's the matter with your eyes?
It's the smoke.

## Do you think your wife would walk up three flights of stairs just to eat out of paper plates?
Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.

## Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
Say, what kind of a pal are you? You're not going to leave me flat?

## How is her family going to feel about it?
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.

## Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself?
Nothing.

## What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
I dyed one and washed the other.

## Staring at us?
My mistake - she's glaring.

## No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before. It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?
Yes.

## Hello, Hank. How are you?
I'm sorry, Stew. I asked Hank, and Hank did the rest.

## I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?
Okay.

## How far have you gotten?
Well, I've just been able to get off that Norway coast - so far.

## Been where?
To Old Madrid.

## Then how do you expect to write about it?
Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.

## Did who?
Conrad.

## Isn't he the one that always writes about things - only the things he knows about?
Right.

## Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
Here you are.

## All right, thanks. Now, let's see. How will I start? Hey pal, how would you start?
Nope - afraid I'm all out of tricks tonight.

## Now, we've got it right up to where the boy's wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters - how's that?
It'll be ready in a minute.

## Who was that?
Grayson - Anne's lawyer.

## What did he want?
Gallagher, that guy just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third act.

## What other girl?
The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.

## Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?
No.

## Nice set of Conrads you have out there, Mrs. Schuyler. I was just glancing through this one. What's Michael tearing the paper about?
Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around.

## Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court.

## Well, well. That takes it out of the rumor class, doesn't it?
No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.

## Now don't be absurd, Smith May I come in?
Surely, come right in.

## Thanks. May I sit down?
Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.

## She did?
She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.

## Sure.
Wait a minute. Do I get from you that she wants to pay me alimony?

## I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?
Oh, Smythe, some bicarbonate of soda, quick - double strength. I know those news mongrels will upset me.

## Are the cars ready?
They've been ready for the last half hour.

## Get out of here.
Why

## And you struck him right here in our house?
Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man.

## I understand, sir.
Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? Haven't you any decency left?

## Now, now Jeeves. Was that nice? Was that being a gentleman, Jeeves? Was it, Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves, isn't it?
The name is Smythe.

## Shhh! Do you hear something?
Yes, sir.

## Me, sir?
Yes, sir.

## Found no skeletons?
No, sir.

## Smythe, what do you do with yourself - I mean, when you're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with yourself?
Well, sir, I putter.

## Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
I just putter.

## Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.

## Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
Well sir, I'll show you.

## No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.

## Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
Yes sir.

## How about me? Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day I might be a putterer?
You sir? Uh-uh. You could never be a putterer. Not a good putterer, sir.

## A bird in a gilded cage?
I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue. It's so flattering.

## Can I ask you a question?
Sure.

## Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ... Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
Yeah ... That--and ...

## What?
It doesn't matter.

## You sure you want to know this?
Yes.

## What?
Well ... ... Your father would never do anything like that.

## We're in Pleasantville?
Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.

## Why no. She's still on her date with Biff ... is something the matter?
No, I ... I was just ... worried about her.

## How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
I'm fine.

## Have you got any make up?
In my handbag.

## Does it look okay?
Looks just like it did.

## And they won't be able to tell?
No ... They won't be able to tell.

## What?
Thank you.

## Where'd you get this?
Bud brought it to me.

## Bud?
Here's my favorite.

## Isn't it great how she's resting like that?
She's crying.

## What?
She's crying.

## What is that?
I don't know.

## How was your day?
Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said that if things keep going the way they are, I might be seeing that promotion sooner than I thought.

## All night?
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.

## Where are you gonna go?
I'm gonna go now.

## What's all the commotion? Where's the cat?
Um ... It's ...

## Really Biff? The keenest?
Oh yeah.

## Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
Hunh? Oh, right ...

## Oh you bet. Will you excuse me for a sec?
Anyhow ... I really wanted to come over and sit next to you in civics but ...

## But where would we go?
... Lover's Lane.

## ... Why?
I think ... I might be ill ...

## It is?
Trust me ...

## What are you doing?
It's six-thirty ...

## Why not?
I'm busy.

## With what?
Don't! Just let go.

## What?
I don't believe it.

## What's the matter?
You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ...

## Yeah ... How'd you know?
Lucky guess. Look, Biff ... I don't think it's a real good time for that right now ...

## She won't go out with me?
I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...

## What'll it be?
Oh, no thanks ...

## No. What?
Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.

## Oh my gosh. What's he gonna to do?
I really don't know. Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market.

## ... How?
No. They do. And it isn't just 'cause you're a great bowler ... They respect you ...

## Are you alright? What is it?
Rain.

## Did you do this?
Yes I did.

## Do you know that it's illegal?
Yes I do.

## BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.

## Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
We prefer to keep these proceedings as \"pleasant\" as possible. I don't think a lawyer will be necessary.

## Do you further admit that this was done surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness?
Well--it was dark out ...

## The basketball team?
Sure. Everybody's upset because they're not winning anymore--but just think how it would feel if all of a sudden they do win.

## What do you mean!?
Well, I never had to do it before.

## And where's that?
Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.

## What's outside of Pleasantville?
Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.

## I thought the books were blank?
Hello Bud.

## What color is that hedge of yours?
Green.

## What are you doing?
David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna like be here in five minutes.

## Pleasantville Marathon?
Yeah. Every episode ever.

## What happened?
I'm not sure.

## What did you do?
I don't know.

## I don't know ... It's not possible ... Is it possible?
I don't believe this.

## You know him?
Owns the hardware store.

## Play along?
Well, yeah. I'm ... Bud Parker and you're ... um--Mary Sue.

## Who's that?
Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.

## Does he--you know--like \"me\"?
As a matter of fact he does.

## Can we do any better?
I don't think so.

## What?
I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.

## He won't notice anyway.
What were you doing in a library?

## What do you mean?
They don't notice that kind of thing.

## So what's the point?
Jen please ...

## What did you do to him?
Nothing.

## Well if I don't who will?
They're happy like this.

## David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set. You like all this don't you?
I just don't think we have the right to ...

## Um--hello? You want to like take a look?
Me too. Sounds swell.

## The pages filled in?
But like only up to the part about the raft, because I didn't read any farther.

## What's wrong?
Nothing.

## You're reading?
Yeah. Can't believe you started such a dorky fad.

## D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?
... Yeah.

## Well ... I just ... Can I ask you a question?
Sure.

## Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?
Yeah ...

## You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.

## Can I ask you a question?
Yes.

## What?
Oh, I don't know. Maybe ... ... it's not just the sex ...

## Are you sure?
I told you. I'm like positive.

## Besides. You think there's like a chance I'm gonna get into college back there?
Honestly ... no.

## And you're sure about this?
I've done the slut thing, David. It's really kinda old.

## ... Lover's Lane?
Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.

## Do they have those ... Where you come from?
Yeah ... I guess. I don't know.

## What?
Out there.

## How?
Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...

## What's that like?
Well it's big. And it's blue ... ... It's really really blue.

## Hunh?
I picked them myself. They grow wild up here. Mmm. So sweet.

## They just grow like that?
Oh yeah. There's a lot of stuff. Currants and strawberries ... Here. I'll show you.

## What's going on?
Rain.

## What do we do?
We'll just put up the top.

## It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?
It was a prop for the school play ...

## Can I open it?
Sure ...

## Where are they?
I'm not sure.

## Scout?
Marmalade.

## You're unbelievable. You'll win this thing for sure. When is it on?
Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.

## A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night?
Of course it is Howard. That's why they call it a Marathon.

## DYKE Well that makes it a lucky day for both of us, hunh?
... Her father.

## DYKE Right. And how did she dress him?
... Like Prince Charming.

## DYKE What department store did they go to?
McIntire's.

## Ooomph?
DYKE Sure. Big beautiful set like this--you want something that'll put you right in the show.

## How much does it cost?
DYKE Oh--couldn't charge you for something like that. It's free.

## I can't.
DYKE Why would I do that?

## DYKE What?
Talk about it. Right now, I mean. I got to ... um ...

## Re-runs?
DYKE Like when Margaret Henderson makes her cookies for Whitey. ... Those aren't your cookies Bud.

## DYKE Excuse me?
DYKE What do I MEAN! You think this is a toy? You think it's your own little goddamn coloring book ...

## DYKE Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
Look ...

## DYKE EXCUSE ME?
I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.

## Why?
DYKE Because you're coming home.

## Why don't you just take me back without it?
DYKE Oh. You're a smart little bastard aren't you? It's kind of like a restricted ticket. You gotta leave the same way you came.

## DYKE How long do you think you've been here?
I don't know ... Three, four weeks.

## I'm going on trial tomorrow?
DYKE This is TV pal. They don't fool around.

## Bud?
Sorry ... I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat ...
