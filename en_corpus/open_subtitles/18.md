yes, according to my superior.

## why did dr. gilliam try to restrain the procreative ability of bioroids?
deunan, this mission is dangerous.

## can i ask you a question?
i can't believe it...

## i had to hide it.
what's wrong, deunan?

## bad guys?
yes.

## you're dr. gilliam?
don't move from there please.

## but to trusting your men is always your weakness, briareos.
how did they know we were here?

## briareos, what's going on?
let me tell you deunan.

## remember my land mate got away from him?
because of him, many bioroids died.

## but the information in your hand will destroy our plan.
is that true?

## could you please give it to me?
i refuse.

## general, isn't it rather strange?
seven old men want the apple seed.

## did you have my mom killed?
deunan please forgive us.

## why did mom hide apple seed?
dr. gilliam gave us our only hope.

## step out?
we humans must pass the future of earth over to the bioroids.

## a virus developed by my mom?
yes, on the top of tartarus.

## what do you want, athena?
to prevent the perdition of human race, bioroids were created.

## have you forgotten that?
bioroids were set to obey the orders of humans.

## general uranus?
gaea should have known all these things.

## the defense system of the d tank is unbreakable, right?
if hit by a spider cannon at point blank, it will break.

## a powerful sword and a perfect shield, which will win?
we are trying.

## why not let the new humans bear the sin of the human race?
let it go.

## we can't stop it.
how about no. 8?

## deunan, hitomi.
how come?

## where are the old men?
oh...

## utopia, eh...
about what happened to your body?

## did we get the landing permit from olympus a5?
don't get too close before id is confirmed or the multi legged cannon will fire at us.

## but this is the truth...
still sleeping... perhaps wrong dosage of anesthesia?

## so after such a large scale world war, there is no winner?
yes.

## that's how war is, isn't it?
but it's different here.

## why brought me here?
because you are an elite soldier.

## eswat?
i know you must have lots of questions.

## haven't slept on a soft bed for a long time, haven't you?
i'il pick you up at 10 am tomorrow.

## you are hitomi, right?
yeah.

## haven't we meet before?
no.

## athena you arranged that attack, didn't you?
it's impossible for the mercenaries to confront with eswat.

## now, bioriod won't be able to do as they wishes.
did you forget the mission of bioriod?

## we should not be protecting wolves. instead we should protect the sheep like human, shouldn't we?
indeed that's the principle for our first generation bioriod.

## beautiful city, isn't it?
comparing with where i was yesterday, it's like a dream.

## bioriod?
man made human.

## clones?
no, not simple clones, but man made human with carefully selected human gene.

## does it mean that the city is controlled by clones?
it's not polite to say\" clone\".

## ultravibrate gravity?
yes, like hovering.

## but, you control the car by that steering wheel?
in this city, the use of automation technology has reached such level, this wheel is a symbol of the\" for the people\" idea.

## what's that all about?
city planners used to say that.

## i. n.?
means\" intellectual network\".

## why?
human has emotions.

## who is general uranus?
general commander of olympus military.

## you know her?
probably not.

## scary, right?
recently the eswat under athena's control is growing bigger.

## something wrong?
we've got company.

## hitomi, are you okay?
sure.

## are you hurt?
i am okay.

## the legislative institute and administrative institute began to confront each other over the issues of bioriod population increasing, etc.
you know my father?

## athena is really targeting carl's daughter?
absolutely.

## degree of the information source?
it's level 5.

## what did you fight for?
well...

## hitomi, aren't you late for the life prolonging procedure?
no problem, i will have it done there soon.

## such as\" how have you been in two years?
or\" nice to meet you again\".

## but why would any one be interested in me, and who are these people?
i don't know.

## what is\" apple seed\"?
i don't know.

## may i sit here?
sure.

## deunan, how about your father carl knute?
he died before the great war.

## your mother?
i cannot remember anything about her.

## you and briareos were lovers, right?
that's when he was still human.

## what is it like to be in love?
ahh...

## people in love, what are they like?
the feeling of love someone.

you helped us out.

## happy birthday, uncle irvin.

## a cake for me?
you're really too kind.

## are you ready, children?
not you.

## what is all this bellowing about?
but, sweetheart, it's irvin's birthday.

## irvin's birthday?
why, of course.

## how could i have forgotten?
let us celebrate.

## who could make me cry?
well, boss... we could make you cry with laughter.

## may i give it a try?
i wouldn't waste a nail to hang it up.

## but it's pretty, isn't it?
don't get smart with us.

## that's all?
afraid so.

## you don't want to go to the hole, do you?
it's very cold there.

## see?
when you want to.

## two hours?
we're going to get caught.

## who is this guy?
don't ask me.

## are you thinking what i'm thinking?

## where did those brats go?
i don't know.

## you had big ideas?
poor little tadpole.

## it's always the same old story.

## and if she had an accident?
you never know.

## the winkles cast off their shells?
please continue.

## shivers?
shivers all over.

## and igloos?
oh, yes, tell me about the igloos.

## the boss?
well, this story that among us there's an original clone... different from the others.

## is that true?
of course it's true.

## unique?
yes.

## do you really want to know?
connect yourself to the child.

## to the child?
yes.

## connect myself to the child?
but i can't.

## but it's not lonely being the original?
all the penguins, the centipedes, everyone applauds.

## the better to peck them?
and then when the children's voices cry for help... the chickens are merciless.

## who, the boss?
no, the child.

## what's that?
that, brother angel joseph... is a female.

## what's that?
a midnight snack for the fishes, tonight, pier 24.

## irvin?
such a migraine.

## won't you explain why all those children only have nightmares?
cause you were their nightmare.

## what?
a soul.

## because you believe you have one?
you don't even have a body.

## are you sure that we're doing the right thing?
of course, my pet.

## why worry, krank?
if you're sincere, you have nothing to lose.

## what's it to you?
we need you, marcello, and your creepy crawlies.

## have you still got the knack?
no, please, not again.

## in a half hour?
cyclops truck kidnap little brother.

## what are you doing here?
well, smarty, it wasn't nice of you to disappear.

## no kidding?

## who says so?
pipo saw him.

## life's a real bitch.

## would we do that?
on the contrary.

## boss?
the boy ate your dinner.

## and to the werewolf?
you're only sensitive to your nutritive urges.

## tell me... after you've found your little brother, what'il you do?
don't know.

## well, what kind of wife?
no hurry to choose.

## are you sure you don't remember?
he was a sailor who worked the minefields.

## what on earth is that, mama?
it can't be a submarine.

## right, one?
truer words were never said.

## all right?
he's killing her.

## the two little brats got away, zee.
will you keep quiet?

## but it's not over, is it?
they're hiding.

## and why are they hiding?
because they don't want to play.

## what's the octopus doing?

a perfect specimen that is totally uninhibited.

## it's you who's speaking, mister?
the mines.

## remember?
that was my message.

## what am i doing here?
don't worry.

## why is it his dream?
because he's not afraid of me.

## what would you get in exchange?
a brother.

## you are trying to trap me, aren't you?
you don't risk very much.

## sometimes it's better to land in the muck, huh?
one more.

## how about your conference with the committee on atomic power?
not my conference.

## hardly a routine meeting, would you say?
and look, cal, we won't buy the committee getting you v. i. p. s together for a cocktail party.

## how does that fit in with atomic energy?
you boys like to call this\" the push button age.\" it isn't.

## how long has the army been handing out jets?
one of the boys at lockheed handed me this one.

## cal, when do we get to this\" push button age\"?
when fellas like me stop talking about it and get back to our labs.

## cal, are you working on anything along the lines you mentioned?
roughly.

## well, remember me, will you?
i'm concentrating on the reconversion of certain common elements... into nuclear energy sources.

## huh? how's that again?
what counts is how i make it work.

## drift south about 20 miles per hour.
webb?

## hi, webb. what's cal's e. t. a.?
1410, but he's late.

## cal, what's wrong?
okay.

## how'd you bring it in?
i didn't.

## what do you mean you didn't?
controls went out.

## huh?
that's right.

## are you sure, joe?
positive.

## did you hear anything?
unless he's blind.

## how's the little giant?
growing up.

## what did the committee say?
oh, they were a little excited.

## x c condensers in an envelope?
must be a gag dreamed up by the receiving department.

## pete?
cal meacham.

## what's the address on the letterhead that came with the beads?
no address.

## hello, sam?
sam can't find anything wrong.

## did you double check the controls?
of course not.

## what have you got?
i don't know.

## what are they talking about?
i don't know, but this outfit has them.

## how we gonna build it?
these symbols they're like a foreign language.

## only, uh, where do we start?
right here.

## now what do i do?
clear your screen, please.

## you... can hear me?
of course.

## who are you?
i'm called exeter.

## whether i'm aboard or not?
place the catalog on that table with the blueprints.

## you okay?
okay...

## yes, joe?
whoever that exeter is, i don't like him.

## don't you, joe?
he was right about one thing.

## cal, won't you reconsider?
i did... all night.

## where am i?
georgia.

## once you're at the club, i'm sure you'il like us much better.
boston, wasn't it?

## the club?
that's what we call it.

## not exactly what you expected, dr. meacham, is it?
that's brack, one of exeter's assistants.

## what language do they speak?
english, hindustani, congoese.

## may i use you as exhibit\" a\"?
i'm afraid dr. meacham isn't too happy with me.

## nothing new, perhaps, but then, what is?
however, let me assure you, doctor, that we are dedicated men and women, and as such, we can accomplish wonders.

## well, what do you think of us?
this all sounds great, mr.

## exeter, but why me?
dr. meacham, we happen to know that you're on the threshold...

## suppose when i do, i find i can't go along with you?
naturally, we'il expect you to be discreet about what you've seen here.

## conserving energy is one of our primary concerns, isn't it, doctor?
yes.

## any reason why you can't start in the morning, doctor?
no.

## other units?
yes, we have several at strategic points throughout the world.

## yes?
why schedule as planned.

## mozart, exeter?
i'm afraid i don't know the chap.

## composer?
he belongs to the world.

## you, dr. carlson?
show him the grounds.

## what are you getting at?
i seem to remember that was part of exeter's pitch.

## how about you and dr. adams showing me my laboratory instead?
after all i've heard today, i can hardly wait to add my little contribution... to the good work.

## well, what do you think of it?
it's not bad.

## what's your opinion, doctors?
all right, i'il spell it out for you.

## we have a right to throw a few questions at you. what are you doing here?
look, i received a darn fool catalog.

## sunlamp?
that's what it looks like.

## what about the others?
try talking to them.

## who's exeter working for?
we don't know.

## why did you wait, brack?
you should have told me.

## if you're so concerned, why don't you let me use the transformer?
the transformer is not the only answer.

## it may be true, but are you sure?
we're 30 miles from nowhere.

## and if we did get out, who'd believe all this?
i don't blame you doctors for being excited about working for exeter.

## why not, brack?
and perhaps you'd like me to step in with him.

## notice that section of lead plate behind you?
please bring it forward about eight feet.

## neutrino rays?
you've just observed one in action.

## do you notice...
the green light?

## the peculiar indentations in both their foreheads?
coincidental, no doubt.

## are you prepared to leave?
we have been since your last communication, although meacham and adams are achieving positive results.

## can you give us another time period?
impossible.

## what is it?
something i've seen before.

## is it flyable?
it should be.

## like the others in that house?
what happened was beyond my control.

## where are we going?
to a planet we call metaluna.

## metaluna?
there's no such planet in the solar system.

## how are you controlling the fantastic temperature on this ship?
what's to prevent us from floating around like balloons...

## once we leave earth's gravity?
to answer the last question first, we create our own gravitational field.

## what are you doing to them?
metaluna's atmospheric pressure is like that in your greatest oceans.

## brack?
yes.

## and you?
feel like a new toothbrush.

## what don't you understand, doctor?
those two objects.

## is zahgon a planet?
a planet that was once a comet.

## to where?
to your earth.

## then why haven't your superior brains solved the problem of synthesizing uranium?
most of our scientists are dead, our major laboratories destroyed.

## do you still insist, exeter, that we can allow any of these earth creatures to have free minds?
i do.

## in there?
my mind is my own and nobody's gonna change it.

## do you believe him, cal?
the spaceship.

## don't you understand?
i'il be all right.

## will we be able to get out?
depends on the amount of energy we have left.

## what about you?
i'il use the third tube.

## exeter, are these tubes strong enough to keep him out?
possibly.

## where are you going?
our universe is vast, full of wonders.

## ready virge?
anytime.

## what's my time?
five eight.

## remember?
yeah.

## guys, what... what can i say?
hey, it worked out great for me, mcdermott.

what we want to do at the wto is help you achieve your dollar results.

## that slaves still existed, and that it were easy to own one.
but how did workers ever get to be a problem?

## what do you think it would cost today to profitably maintain a slave, say, here in tampere?
i'm about to show you an actual prototype of the wto's solution to two major management problems of today.

we have to pick them up.

## we pick them up?
he was interested in having the wto come speak at the economics department.

## can you do it?
i'm thinking that you probably shouldn't be associated with the hamburgers.

## and... who is to say whether people in the third world want a burger?
we're culturally different.

## like... if you saw have you ever seen starving people?
in pictures.

## this is a money maker, correct?
yes.

## how are you going to get around the cultural and legal implications of cannibalism and basically asking us to recycle shit?
the reality is that we already treat people in the third world far worse than we treat our domestic animals.

## how did you know?
what a wonderful gift.

## and, um... how did you like my gift to you?
well, pooh, this particular christmas, you didn't, uh, give me a gift.

## perhaps you, uh, forgot?
how could i ever forget something as important as you...

## oh, my goodness.... happy new year!... it is?
well, almost... it's new year's eve, so tonight, we're having a party.

## and we'il make our new year's resolutions.
a party?

## and something sweet?

## so where, may i ask, is this party to be?
why, anywhere our friends are together, pooh.

## uh, h hello?
mmm.

## and where's piglet?
a a a a choo!... bless you.... bless you.

## what are you doing under there?
we both got v very scared, a and i wasn't sure what to do.

## thanks for noticin '.
must you be afraid of everything, piglet?

## what are you doing under there, besides being sad and gloomy?
not much... as usual.

## what party?
why, the one we're having at your house, of course.

## is that a\" no,\" rabbit?
come on, long ears.

## what will we do without him?
well, we could have the party at your house, i suppose.

## pooh, isn't there something we can do to make rabbit stay?
think, think, think.

## it's a promise that you make to yourself to change.
perhaps since rabbit isn't happy with the way we are, he might be happier with some way we... aren't?

## uh, c change?
well, if it means rabbit won't move away, then... then i'm ready to change.

## what?
and so pooh's friends, trying to please rabbit, found themselves in a bit of a jam.

## tigger can't bounce, and eeyore can't be gloomy, then the question is...
jam?

## oh, d d dear.
what do we do now?

## tigger, a are you alright?
oh, why, sure.

## oh, i did it again... said i was afraid.
see?

## uh, tigger, you're never afraid, are you?
i guess i was too busy bouncin 'to ever think about it.

## so that means if i bounce, i won't be afraid?
i guess bouncin 'does keep you from being afraid.

## even... a tad t trembly?
just around the edges, uh...

## what ever are you looking for?
well, i i certainly wasn't looking for, um...

## what ever could it be?
i'm sure i wouldn't know.

## oh, you see, little fellow?
it'il be wonderful.

## might you happen to have a little bit of a teeny taste of a small smackerel... of something... and perhaps that something might be sweet?
thanks for noticin '.

## oh, d d dear.

## what could be wrong?
we're trying to be different.

## now, why would i want to leave friends who are so loyal they would change just to please me?
but we didn't change.

a very hungry one.

they're on computer file.

## and left the other two intact?
no, he definitely dropped...... that. 38 by accident at the struggle.

come on, detective.

## what's that supposed to mean?
i guess you'd have to be, passing your detective exam so young and all.

## think i could ever be a hotshot detective like you, mr. pruitt?

## mac, can i have a word?

## you want to tell me what's going on?
roy.

## what?

## what's the charge?
murder.

## what is this?
the nail in his coffin.

## sometimes it's better if you don't have to tell me everything?

oh, yes, dear.

## yes?
we've discussed everything... and we're very sorry about what we did today.

i said, you are the father of jane and michael banks.

## may i see them?
oh, i make it a point never to give references.

## we'il have to see about that then, won't we?
now then, the qualifications.

## where did you get it from?
i thought i tore it up.

## i thought that i...
have you lost something?

## and you did advertise for a nanny, did you not?
george banks.

## are you ill?
i hope not.

## we must be very clear on that point, mustn't we?
yes, it's done.

## what?
well, eh, she's in the nursery of course, i mean.

## tell me, is she everything that we'd hoped she be?
well, i it all happened rather quickly.

## will she mould our young breed?
you know, winifred, i think she will.

## the others?
oh, yes.

## y yes, sir?
tell the other applicants they may go.

## the others, sir?
yes, the others.

## how many nannies does she think we need in this house?
the position has been filled.

## it is rather like a bear pit, isn't it?
that's a funny sort of bag.

## you mean to carry carpets in?
no.

## what?
my tape measure.

## what do you want it for?
i want to see how you two measure up.

## how 'bout you?
it's lovely.

## i told you she was tricky.
now, shall we get on with it?

## it is a game, isn't it, mary poppins?
well, it depends on your point of view.

## well, i've seen 'em here and about.
still they're better than a finger in your eye, ain't they?

## chasin 'a kite last time, weren't it?
mary poppins is taking us to the park.

## to the park?
not if i know mary poppins.

## how about a lovely circus?
lions and tigers.

## beautiful, ain't it?
a typical english countryside... as done by a true and lovin 'hand.

## no road?
just wants a bit of somethin 'here... and a bit of somethin 'there.

## please?
such a lovely place.

## don't you think it's lovely, mary poppins?
now's the time, mary poppins.

## do what?
bit of magic.

## a bit of magic?
it's easy.

## why do you always complicate things that are really quite simple?
give my your hand, please, michael.

## do you really think so?
cross my heart you do.

## very nice, indeed... if you don't wanna go nowhere.
down the road behind the hill, remember?

## my horse is the fastest.
who says we're not going anywhere?

## come on, my lad.
do you hear that, mate?

## is that the best you can do?
hurry up, boy.

## now hang on.
view halloo?

## would you look at that now?
certainly, ma'am.

## uh, how does it feel, mary poppins, winning the race?
oh, well i...

## am i right, bert?
tell 'em what it is.

## but that's going a bit too far, don't you think?
indubitably.

## yes?
people who get their feet wet must learn to take their medicine.

## do you have a handkerchief under your pillow?
mm hmm.

## easily made, easily broken.
will you stay if we promise to be good?

## whatever would we do without you?
i shall stay until the wind changes.

## but, mary poppins, how long will that be?
silence, please.

## a respectable person like me in a horse race?
how dare you suggest such a thing.

## put in a double charge of powder.
is that clear?

## a double charge?
aye, aye, sir.

## shake things up a bit, what?
lovely, lovely morning, ellen.

## have you put the spoiled eggs in my carryall?
yes, ma'am.

## what's all that fearful caterwauling in the kitchen?
it's cook singing.

## what's wrong with her?
she's happy as a cricket.

## is that so?
take ellen for instance.

## really?
well, that is extraordinary.

## who said i'm not feeling well?
i don't think there's anything to explain.

## do you?
it's obvious that you're out of sorts this morning.

## yes, dear?
i suggest you have this piano repaired.

## dig for buried treasure?
we're going to buy some fish.

## and thank you very much.
again?

## what did he say?
he said,\" you're welcome\".

## what else did he say?
i don't think he said anything.

## why don't you go home and put your feet up?
oh, bert, i'm glad you're here.

## well, how is he?
it's contagious, you know.

## shall we get spots?
oh, highly unlikely.

## but i so enjoy laughing, you know?
and, well...

## speaking of names, i know a man with a wooden leg named smith.
in a watch factory?

## wasn't that funny?
yes, please.

## uh, bert?
uh, no, no, thank you.

## nice weather we're having this time of year, don't you think?
oh, yeah.

## the shopkeeper said to him,\" how long do you want it?
your tea, uncle albert.

## and the lady said,\" that's all right with me, but how are you at catching mice?
you know, people come to see me all the time, you know.

## uh, keep an eye on uncle albert, will you, bert?
i'il sit with him a while.

## would you like to hear it?
i'd be so grateful.

## well, it's about me granddad, see?
and one night, he had a nightmare, he did.

## \" how do you feel, granddad?
yes.

## want to hear a joke?
we had the most wonderful afternoon with mary poppins.

## smith?
we don't know anyone called smith.

## oh.
and there was a second chap, and the second chap says,\" what's the name of his other leg?

## oh, mary poppins said that, did she?
will you please return to your room.

## mary poppins, will you be kind enough to come with me?
as you wish.

## is anything the matter?
i'm afraid there is.

## george, are you certain you know what you're doing?
i believe i do, winifred.

## but tea parties on the ceiling?
i ask you.

## where are we going?
to the bank, of course, exactly as you proposed.

## i proposed?
of course.

## winifred, did i say that i was going to take the children to the bank?
it certainly sounded that way, dear.

## kindly stop spinning about me.
and why not?

## but?
goats butt, birds fly... and children who are going on an outing with their father must get some sleep.

## an outing with father?
yes.

## manage what?
to the bank.

## past the end of his nose?
the bird woman.

## you do see her, don't you, father?
well, of course i can see her.

## do you think i can't see past the end of my nose?
listen, father, she's saying it.

## whatever for?
i have tuppence from my money box.

## waste your money on a lot of ragamuffin birds?
certainly not.

## what's all this about?
these are my children, mr dawes.

## but why are they here?
they wish to open an account, sir.

## oh, indeed?
yes.

## and just how much money do you have, young man?
tuppence.

## tuppence?
precisely how i started.

## a giant?
shh, shh, shh.

## oh, they do, do they, boy?
excellent.

## may i be permitted to see it?
all for the lack of...

## now, who's after you?
father is.

## what?
he brought us to see his bank.

## well, now that don't seem likely, does it?
it's true.

## father in a cage?
they makes cages in all sizes and shapes, you know.

## oh, sure about that, are you?
look at it this way.

## who looks after your father?
tell me that.

## when something terrible happens, what does he do?
fends for himself, he does.

## michael, be quiet.
who does he tell about it?

## bert, do you think father really needs our help?
well, not my place to say.

## you haven't been running off again, have you?
you know how terribly it upsets me.

## well, will you ask mrs brill?
you've been so kind in looking after the children.

## uh, me, ma'am?
w well, well, i i i have to be moving along.

## you see how wrong people can be?
that there is what you might call a doorway to a place of enchantment.

## it's like i got a whale on the end of the line, ain't it?
well, that's a bit awkward.

## well, we can't have them gallivanting up there like kangaroos, can we?
michael, don't be frightened.

## will you put your things on at once?
hurry up, please.

## it's just good, clean soot, michael.
why not, mary poppins?

## as far as we go, right?
not at all.

## what did i tell ya?
there's the whole world at your feet.

## and who gets to see it, but the birds, the stars and the chimney sweeps?
lovely.

## will you be good enough to explain all this?
first of all, i would like to make one thing quite clear.

## yes?
i never explain anything.

## tonight, sir?
yes, banks.

## you know what i think?
yes, yes, of course.

## do you know what she did?
i realize it now.

## tricked you into taking the children on an outing?
yes.

## father?
we're sorry about the tuppence.

## will that make everything all right?
thank you.

## do you know what happened?
yes, sir.

## do you deny it?
i do not deny it, sir.

## steady on.
what are you waiting for?

## well, do you have anything to say, banks?
just one word, sir.

## yes?
supercalifragilistic expialidocious.

## what?
there's no such word.

## snapper?
yes.

## what's the name of his other leg?
my nanny.

## she only promised to stay till the wind changed.
father?

## and what would happen to me, may i ask... if i loved all the children i said goodbye to?
yes, sir, that's right.

## on the premises?
i can't make out what the inspector's sayin '.

## what happened at the bank?
i've been sacked, discharged, flung into the street.

## george, what on earth were you doing in the cellar?
you'il see in a moment.

## michael?
your father's calling you.

## michael?
that's what i said, sir.

## well, don't you care?
practically perfect people never permit sentiment to muddle their thinking.

## is that so?
well, i'il tell you one thing, mary poppins, you don't fool me a bit.

## oh, really?
yes, really.

## that s why you need me, right?
that depends on how you look at it.

## what s with all that noise in your brain today?
must be a loose wire.

## don t you think this is going to be trouble later if section 9 interferes with section 6?
if section 6 manages to catch the bastard, then all they can really do about it is deporting him.

## huh?
i don t believe it.

## so what business brings the chief of section 9 to the ministry of foreign affairs?
i need to ask you about the secret talks scheduled with the gavel republic tomorrow.

## what s the ministry going to do?
well, there s a problem.

## you mean colonel maless, correct?
yes, and that means we either tonight grant them the funds   and treat maless as a political refugee, or help them.

## what s happening to the eeg output?
it s normal.

## so how much time do we have before this hacker breaks through her barrier program   and reaches her ghost?
roughly two hours.

## are we talking about the puppet master, the infamous mystery hacker?
well, we don t know a lot either.

## so, why the nick name?
the nick name  puppet master  comes from the ghost hacking.

## well, if he s so skilled, how come he s using an outdated ha 3 virus?
think about it a minute.

## just so no one would suspect maless?
or maybe someone wants us to think in that direction.

## which reminds me, are you still using that revolver?
you should stop worrying about the automatics jamming up.

## why did you transfer a guy like me from the police force?
because we need a guy like you.

## huh?
my wife never has any time.

## how did you get your hands on a barrier breaker?
from this really nice fella.

## hey, pop.
what s the point in us breaking our butts?

## did you see someone or not?
clever.

## got it?
we got the data on the refuse collection points.

## well?
ain t no way i m gonna be your partner in crime.

## just arrest them.
see?

## hm?
ah.

## got him, huh?
ghost hacked.

## so who is it?
28.

## and in reality?
his nick name s corgi.

## and how is ishikawa doing?
about the same progress as the rest of us.

## come in?
he s only a puppet himself.

## what s a simulated experience again?
well.

## this is the photo you showed to your co worker.
do you understand what i m saying?

## what do you see?
i had a picture of her.

## where did you meet your wife, and when did you marry her?
i m sorry to put you through this, pal.

## will i get my own memory back?
your original memory will never be fully restored,   and there might be resituational simulation.

## what if the floaters don t work or something else fails?
i suppose i il die then.

## or would you dive in to rescue me?
i didn t beg you to come along, and i sure as hell don t want a lecture.

## what do you mean?
i thought you d already been through all the underwater training courses.

## in those deep, dark waters?
when i float weightless back to the surface, i m imaging i m becoming someone else.

## batou, how much of your body is original?  hey, are you drunk or something?
easily remedy.

## who re we to complain?
i suppose the occasional tune up is a small price to pay for all this.

## what the hell is it that you see at the bottom in that darkness?
what we see now is like a dim image in a mirror ; then we shall see face to face.

## that was you, wasn t it?
sensors have resumed function.

## shall we?
that s enough.

## caught traffic, major?
guess i il be nice and bring the latecomer up to speed.

## yeah, why not?
even a doll can seem to have a soul.

## make sure that the barriers are on too.
where s the logic in that?

## all right?
chief, i m assembling a barrier maze.

## why not contain it in another body first?
i have to see for myself what s in there.

## today?
you know, she s been acting weird from the get go   ever since this whole puppet master episode started.

## chief, you ve ever questioned the ethics of the neural sergeants   who monkey around inside your brain?
they undergo psychiatrical evaluations, especially those in security.

## tell ishikawa not to go crazy, okay?
hey, what s on your mind?  that robot.

## did we seem similar to you?  of course not.  no, i don t mean physically.  just what, then?
well, i guess cyborgs like myself have a tendency to be paranoid about our origins.

## have you ever seen your own brain?
it sounds to me like you re doubting your own ghost.

## and if it did, just what would be the importance of being human then?
hm.

## we are both busy men, so let s keep this short, shall we?
yes, that s my intention.

## security, whose official vehicles are in the basement parking lot?
according to the register, a mr. nakamura from the treaties bureau and a dr. willis, sir.

## does that nakamura guy have a special order cyborg body?
no, there aren t any cyborgs in section 6.

## you checked the pressure sensors in the parking structure, didn t you?
right.

## the security camera show only two people,   but remember how sensitive the sensors on the entrance doors are?
they took a full three seconds longer than usual to close after the two went in.

## with my trusty matever?
any time.

## huh?
well, what is it?  it s confirmed.

## no doubt, it s him.   him ?
uh  the doctor is referring to the original pattern of the ghost line that s now in the body.

## you caused the puppet master to dive into a cyborg, then meanwhile murdered his real body?
yes, that sums it up.

## as a sentient life form, i hereby demand political asylum.
why are your sensors on?

## this is no proof at all that you re a living, thinking life form.
is this a joke?

## how can you?
when neither modern science nor philosophy can explain what life is.

## fortunately there is no death sentence in this country.
who the hell is this?

## what is it  artificial intelligence?
i fired off six shots at the front and rear windows.

## finally found a use for your damn matever, huh?
an antique prop in a decoy maneuver.

## it registrates, right?
yeah, you ve got him.

## intact, you understand?

his lordship is to edinburgh for the assize, then to london direct.

## aye, it's a terrible shock, the sight of such a fortune within reach, is it not?

## rob, do you know why calvinists are against shagging standing up?
no, coil.

## he signed for this bag of coin?
indeed.

## weil, what news?
the ship sailed the day before i got there, and mcdonald's name was not on the harbourmaster's iist.

unguarded, unasked, but there a iifetime's wages in a bag.

## but was he ever handed 1, 000 before?
he was handed a hundred times more.

## why do you not believe me?

by his repute alone.

## what is john campbeil, duke of argyil, to us that you must defend him against montrose?
i did not defend him.

## and the iochside?
they'ii not iikely come by the shore, but watch aii ways.

## you stay by your mother and be her help, you hear?
let argyii know that you are persecuted for his sake.

## and iikely you'ii slip down in the night when the mood takes you.
what?

## or wiii you just find yourself a sheep to comfort you?
if i do, it wiii be one that doesn't bleat so bitter.

## aye, but is he over the seas or under them?

i know.

## do you have a sister?
the poachers are here.

## did you see them?

## what kind of cereal is this?
delicious.

## delicious?

## this cheetah cub... where where did you get him?
i picked him up... on the savannah.

## you... bought him?
no.

## how are you ever going to grow big enough to make me a coat?
oh, i'm afraid you'il have to miss the solar eclipse.

## hmm?
and then, my brat sister decided to run away from boarding school without any consideration for me, her only sister.

## do you see something, boko?
if it was just eliza, i would say go on, go play in the jungle.

## brat sister?
wow.

## tembo valley?

## do you know it?
eliza you are a little troublemaker.

## oh, really?

## never?
first of all, we didn't have a backyard.

## what are you feeling?
no, no, it was just... something my parents wanted us to do so that they would feel more enlightened.

## you know, so that we'd feel comfortable talking about sex?
it's probably why now i prefer\" pee pee\" and\" who who.

nothing, but that movie was pandering.

## at least those movies don't pretend to be what they're not.
the problem with that is...?

## you have those?

## eli?

## you're kidding, right?
you just establish that fuzzy wuzzy had no hair.

## why would you then ask\" was he\"?
like a question, like you didn't know if he was fuzzy or not.

## why are you so uptight?
i'm not.

## what?
no.

## but i had to test it, you know?
ofcourse.

## you look lost.
who knows what the tide could bring?

## where are you headed?
well, i was just about to figure that out.

## must the church be so drafty, mr. elton?
it is very difficult to surrender the soul... when one is worried about one's throat.

## miss taylor, surely you're not serving cake at your wedding?
far too rich.

## where is mr. perry, the apothecary?
he will support me.

## what?
i have to take father home.

## why should she give up being your governess only to be married?
i am grown now.

## i said poor miss taylor and poor, indeed, she is.
can she truly wish to give life to a mewling infant... who will import disease each time it enters the house?

## and how is my sister? ls your brother giving her the respect... we woodhouse ladies deserve?
poor lsabella.

## but where is the fault with you?
emma bears it well.

## triumph?
you made a lucky guess.

## have you never known the triumph of a lucky guess?
had i not promoted mr. weston's visits... and given encouragement where encouragement was needed, we might not have had a wedding today.

## w well, how do you do, mr. elton?
we are the happy ones, not only to be here tonight, but for the beautiful hindquarter of pork you sent us.

## oh, doesn't your hair look pretty?
just like an angel.

## where will you live now that you've completed your education?
mrs. goddard has been kind enough to let me stay on with her.

## mr. weston, have you had any news of your son?
oh, indeed.

## have, have you ever read such a letter, mr. knightley?
do you know, this... this reminds me of jane's style somewhat.

## isn't miss smith delightful?
i watched her with continuous pleasure.

## and what kind of people are your parents?
i do not know.

## wasn't that kind?
tell me more about mr. martin.

## is he a man of information?
oh, yes.

## and what sort of looking man is he?
mmm.

## have you never seen him when he is in town?
fine, dear.

## this is a bit of a chance, isn't it?
good day, mr. martin.

## miss woodhouse, may i present mr. martin?
this is miss woodhouse.

## how do you do?
oh.

## but i go again tomorrow, and i will make every effort to get that thought into my head.
were you able to find the romance of the forest?

## how's your mother?
really, harriet, we can do better than this.

## mr. elton said something very kind about you the other day.
did he take your advice and get the book you asked him to read?

## an idea has just dropped into my mind, surely from heaven itself.
can you not tell me what it was?

## what if you were to exercise your artistic talents... and draw a portrait of miss smith?
how i would love to watch you draw her.

## oh, miss woodhouse, may i look, please?
i cannot wait another second.

## might i be entrusted with such a commission?
i would be gratified more than words can express.

## you did not plan to return an answer favorable to this claim?
but if you'il not influence me, i must do as well as i can by myself.

## oh, do you think that's right or wrong? ls it wrong?
now that you have decided, i will share the feelings i kept you in suspense of.

## who makes you his confidant?
i have reason to believe that harriet smith will soon receive... an offer of marriage from a man desperately in love with her.

## oh, yes?
yes.

## you saw her answer?
emma.

## you wrote her answer, didn't you?
if i did, i would have done no wrong.

## what are harriet smith's claims of birth or education... that make her higher than robert martin?
she is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom.

## even with all his merit, a match for my dear friend?
it would be a degradation for her to marry a person... whom i could not admit as my own acquaintance.

## for illegitimacy and ignorance... to marry to a respected, intelligent farmer?
she is a gentleman's daughter.

## hmm?
ship, dear.

## he writes to me about courtship?
harriet, i think we can have no doubt as to mr. elton's intentions.

## mrs. clark, how are we?
mustn't grumble.

## what have you brought us?
i am sorry i was not more help.

## i heated some  soup?
fire.

## where are you off to?
to town, ma'am, to get some broth.

## dear, must we walk so quickly?
mum said i should hurry.

## do you mean it?
i do.

## the journey from london, how was it?
if you accepted adults with as little whim as you do these children, we might always agree.

## but hasn't the lapse of 21 years closed the gap?
narrowed it.

## sister, dear, when shall we meet your new friend, miss smith?
i have some sad news.

## yes, would you like a whiskey?
not at the moment.

## miss woodhouse, are you warm enough?
yes, thank you.

## when did you receive his news?
you are very kind, but i can only imagine that he's quite comfortable.

## i wondered if perhaps... you might be so kind as to bring me some punch?
i only hope i can complete the task quickly enough.

## how could i not be concerned?
the whole situation is most alarming.

## have i not some right to complain?
emma, the weather's distressing your father.

## mr. weston?
come, mr. woodhouse.

## miss smith?
mr. elton, the wine has weakened you.

## who can think of miss smith when miss woodhouse is near?
oh, no.

## why else would i go to london to have your picture framed?
allow me to interpret the silence.

## how do you feel about what i have said?
mr. elton, any hopes i had with regard to you were for harriet... and harriet alone.

## what is it?
oh, miss taylor mrs. weston.

## you knew?
i had my suspicions, but the party confirmed it.

## mr. knightley?
he was very cross because i had urged harriet to reject a proposal from robert martin.

## that nice farmer?
at least there i was right.

## too pert?
my dear, you said you would never try to match anyone again.

## why?
in his letter to father, he wrote he is going to bath to relax and meet new people.

## mr. elton?
while expressing his fervent admiration for you as a person, it is unhappily i who have captured his fancy.

## do you suppose mr. elton is meeting young ladies while he is away?
i do not know.

## treat?
but the best of it is, the best of it is... that we were just speaking of a topic that would interest you both.

## isn't it nice to have visitors, mother?
the most amusing thing just happened.

## there you are.
remember, mother?

## oh, and cheat you out of the pleasure of hearing it, miss woodhouse, as only jane can put things?
upon my honor, i would not.

## where's that letter?
yes, here it is.

## how were you able to get away?
the campbells have gone to lreland on a holiday.

## was he handsome?
many say he is.

## was he agreeable?
he was in no way disagreeable.

## was he a man of information?
all his statements seemed correct.

## why should you care so much about frank churchill?
i was merely being sociable, that's all, and she was not.

## oh, good heavens.
would you join me?

## is your horse just washing his feet or are there darker forces at work here?
the latter, i'm afraid.

## then you have not seen them?
we shall have to go there first.

## i met him yesterday.
oh, miss woodhouse, have you heard?

## no?
i have not yet seen him myself, though, um, jane saw him... and she said he was not at all unpleasant to look at.

## but i don't wish them to hope falsely.
has an invitation arrived for a party at the cole's?

## has james brought the letters yet?
i don't know.

## why do they not write?
perhaps they know i must reject them.

## perhaps she may know more.
really?

## do you know her?
oh, yes, she's very elegant.

## mrs. dixon?
that makes sense.

## very elegant, yes.
as much sense do you think as mr. dixon?

## but what makes you say that?
well, she must think so too.

## do you see?
now that mr. dixon has married into the campbells, he would have been there.

## my dear, do you know how miss bates and jane fairfax came here tonight?
mr. knightley sent his carriage.

## what if the pianoforte is from mr. knightley?
oh.

## do you know that piece from the beggar's opera?
i don't approve of surprises.

## miss fairfax, shall we sing another?
that fellow thinks of nothing but showing off.

## yes, mr. knightley?
you must put a stop to this.

## oh, do you think so?
yes.

## yes, aunt?
dear, i wonder if i might say a word to you... before you and mr. churchill begin another song.

## suckling.
not even five minutes to spare for your friends, miss fairfax and miss bates?

## and the size of the rooms?
yes.

## oh?
i fancy not.

## because i don't want to give up my talent.
why does he not try bath?

## was she not your governess?
mrs. weston's modest propriety makes her a model for any woman.

## do you know who came in while we were there?
i cannot imagine.

## quite the gentleman.
knightley?

## i saw her at church.
knightley?

## how do you do, mrs. starr?
good morning, miss woodhouse.

## is it possible that mr. elton met her... while doing charitable work in a mental infirmary?
there is only one thing to do with a person as impossible as she.

## what?
i must throw a party for her, otherwise everyone will feel at once how much i dislike her.

## i rave about her.
do you know whom i just adore?

## do you know what i admire most about her?
she's timid.

## do you know how high it is?
oh, so, you two have been settling...

## i'il go and see him.
that i should marry jane fairfax?

## well, mrs. weston, what do you say about your suspicions now?
he's so very occupied with his not being in love with her, it seems certain that he is.

## oh, wouldn't they be charming?
it would so relieve me to know harriet was well taken care of.

## are you waiting for someone?
hmm, mrs. elton.

## why ever for?
i hear much of her.

## oh, is that they?
do, do excuse me.

## how do you like jane's hair?
she did it herself.

## do you not dance, mr. elton?
most readily, mrs. weston, if you will be my partner.

## why?
certainly mrs. elton has no reason to dislike you.

## what is the point in me being almost 22... if there is still so much for me to learn?
you know more than you realize.

## will you come set the example for your companions?
gladly.

## whom are you going to dance with?
with you, if you will ask me.

## indeed we're not.
brother and sister?

## what of your news?
we must wait until we're at your house in front of the fireplace.

## wasn't the ball lovely?
i had the most wonderful time.

## can you have forgotten?
mr. elton cut his finger, and you urged me to bind the wound.

## really?
i was certain you were developing feelings for someone.

## what are your options after all, jane, hmm?
these sandwiches are delicious, mrs. elton.

## now, jane  shall we all play a game?
i command that we each tell miss woodhouse something entertaining.

## i shall be sure to say three very dull things... as soon as i open my mouth, shan't i?
there may be a difficulty.

## that would be charming.
whilst i pick some more strawberries?

## how could you be so insolent to a woman of her age and situation?
i'd not thought it possible.

## how could i help saying it?
i daresay she did not understand me.

## all the way, and on such a cold night?
certainly i walked.

## my dear, how did you find my old friend and her daughter?
emma has called on mrs. and miss bates.

## when will you be back?
the engagement has been in place for some time.

## now, emma, he's a good man, however wrong this action might be.
although how could he have come here and treated me in this fashion?

## dear, might i entreat you to put mr. weston's heart at ease?
he's been as worried about you as l.

## could you let him know how glad you are for frank... to have found a girl of such steady character?
here is the luckiest father in all of england!

## can you imagine that i knew... when i was encouraging you to give way to your own feelings?
had i known, i would have cautioned you.

## wha what do you mean?
you, you said that you loved a man  i did not name him, but i hope i have developed better taste than to choose frank churchill over him.

## mr. knightley?
to be sure.

## must something be done about it?
you must think him 500 million times more above me than mr. churchill.

## have you any idea of mr. knightley's returning your affection?
yes, i must say that i have.

## this is tragic.
am i wrong to hope as i do?

## why is it tragic that harriet should attach herself... to a man who you admire so much?
i love him... so dearly, so greatly.

## and until he does, you must try to put him out of your mind.
how could john let him do that?

## can you?
certainly i can.

## why do you say that?
lamb stew's his favorite.

## dear lord, if he cannot share a life with me, is it wrong to ask that he not share it with anyone?
i would be content if he would just stay single, lord.

## happy?
w well, i'm...

## may i join you?
of course.

## what?
oh.

## of what nature is this news?
the very best.

## my wound?
i know you must've been... cruelly disappointed by his secret.

## emma, uh is that true?
he imposed on me, but he has not injured me.

## you will not ask me the point of my envy?
well, perhaps you are wise.

## but i cannot desire that.
mr. knightley?

## but why?
i know i made mistakes, but had you been here the last few days... you would have seen how i have tried to change.

## have you not wondered why i never befriended frank churchill?
it was because i knew he was intended for you.

## what of my flaws?
i've humbled you and i've lectured you, and you have borne it as no one could have borne it.

## marry me?
marry me, my wonderful, darling friend.

## what?
i cannot marry you.

## why ever not?
my father.

## miss woodhouse, may i come in?
you know you need never ask.

## all i've got is yen60...... but i'm not giving up.
whatever happened?

## die?
yeah.

## no?
i'm going to fly.

## you can call me that, too.
yeah?

## but...... if i win, you call me mr peco, ok?
you can taste iron in blood.

## i'il try.
i don't mean it like those guys, but why are you so stuck up?

## why do you always skip school?
some college jerk.

## how's the school team?
i sent him to get hoshino.

## hoshino?
the freshman with the bowl cut.

## who's better, the bowl cut or tsukimoto?
because...... the team's awful without you.

## did ota send you?
yes.

## i have, but only once.
aren't you playing?

## tsujido academy got a chinese guy to try and beat dragon.
when was it?

## dragon?
kazama, from kaio academy.

## where did hoshino and tsukimoto go?
i'm going to europe after high school.

## first i'il get on a pro team in germany...
why?

## then why are you skipping practice?
look...

## why not just eat noodles first?
our snack food industry is all screwed up.

## right?
conversation with you is so much fun.

## next station?
the one after that.

## what?
i wish i'd gone to sweden or germany.

## why?
i don't know.

## japanese modesty?
let's go inside.

## who?

## you scared?
losing 21 0.

## keep away from tamura too.

## why?
because...

## what's wrong?
i'm shipping out.

## practice like that?
it's a total waste of time.

## of what?
no, it isn't.

## no?
i don't like dragging someone down just to win a game.

## who'd you draw?
china, in the third game.

## what about you?
i drew...

## you're such a shrimp i almost didn't see you.
demon?

## does your shit school put frosh on the varsity squad?
better than picking up balls for three years at a name school.

## what?
he always shuts himself in the can before a match.

## diarrhea?
no.

## so what if he's chinese?
some black people can't dance.

## but he shouldn't show up someone in front of everybody like that.
what?

## how will that guy feel?
you play your best out of respect for your opponent.

## play your own style.
where's the old glass bottle?

## why?
i just do this to kill time.

## what's wrong with that?
i don't like this play as if it meant your life shit.

## is that a problem?
maybe.

## oh yeah?
anyway, it's not smart to keep changing your game.

## about what?
demon.

## heroes?
someone who comes to help when you're in trouble.

## why bother?
i'm playing kong.

## and if i lose?
lose and you're my dog.

## and you've been there?
nothing's going to change for me, win or lose.

## sure you don't want to bet, mr tsukimoto?
if i win, don't try coaching me ever again.

## what?
now we'il see the real smile.

## china?
no.

## smile '?
they call him that because he never does.

## do you hear me?
yes.

## the local hero?
hand on table.

## what's all this blocking bullshit?
that's what's happening, 'hero '.

## you know how you stop losing?
by winning.

## peco?
you've gotten slow.

## how many days have you missed?
he knows non competition games are against club rules.

## what did you say?
they're excellent.

## well?
give this to tsukimoto for me.

## i asked for some better balls to practise with, didn't i?
oh, yeah... they're on order.

## a chopper?
the guy with the glasses.

## smile?
nope.

## see?
i'm teaching myself.

## do i know you?
you've got an instinct for the game.

## die?
yeah.

## no?
i'm going to fly.

## are you strong?
... taste iron in blood.

## you're still here?
a coach isn't a coach...... without a player.

## show me again, will you?
yep.

## when do i start hitting?
i've been running for two weeks.

## don't you have...... someone to pack you a lunch on a sunny day like this?
i've got a girlfriend.

## i would if i was.
wanna go out?

## butterfly joe?
yep.

## was he really good?
not just good.

## so you defaulted?
i would have.

## could you do that?
that was my last game.

## plus i didn't know where to order them.
well?

## will you hit against me for a bit?
don't leave on me when you find out.

## placement, control, speed...... tsukimoto's in another league.
why do i have to draw china first?

## hmm?
the first time we played, you didn't win a point.

## what's the matter?
i just said there's swimming.

## did your friend win?
i'm doing alright.

## mr sanada never quits, does he?
if there's one guy he doesn't want to lose to, it's tsukimoto.

## who do you play for anyway?
i sympathize.

## have you got diarrhea?
there's more than diarrhea that drives a man to the toilet.

## what do you mean?
stay there.

## where's peco?
in the medical room.

## there's a player coming through.
aren't you worried about him?

## you ok?
your knee...

## does it hurt?
you're a nice guy.

## is he good?
yeah.

## what's going on?
don't ask me.

## you're going to win?
what the hell.

## and now, the 2001 inter high men's table tennis final.

tsukimoto...

## get hoshino to a hospital when this is over, ok?

## can you do that?
it's time for me to go.

## rosolio?
i didn't know that still existed.

## an adult who enters the world of fables cannot leave it.

thieves, only to punish them.

## undertakings bring misfortune\".

## corto maltese, are you sleeping?
no, i was thinking of venice and gold lips.

## the white lotus...

## when will you ever be serious?

## why are you in hong kong?
hong kong isn't reserved for you, as far as i know.

## who?
that junk over there.

## are you bored?
i'm never bored, you know that.

## is this a riddle?
the situation isn't simple.

## chance or coincidence?
a police officer must suspect everyone, commander.

thieves, only to punish them.

## did you receive everything?
yes.

## do you recall a morning of butterflies, an afternoon of wildflowers?
the red lanterns are looking for you.

a secret society.

## what?
the crew...

## are you the only survivor?

you're often spoken of in the house of song, commander.

## are you back in china for this person?
no, rest assured...

## why did you let him go, general?
yeah.

## how did you meet him?
the duchess marina seminova introduced us.

## what did you say?
i lost you in shanghai.

## where'd they go?

## do the cossacks lack a sense of humor?
with semenov, even those who had one, lost it...

## what happened the other night?
you disappeared in a snowstorm.

## is that the duchess?

massage my head...

## why were you between mongolia and manchuria?
i'm trying to forget someone.

## waiting for what?
we came to this fair land to steal koltchak's gold... which ataman semenov himself tried to steal.

## and how does it all end?
that, i don't know.

## you didn't call me here to talk about coleridge.

i thought he was rolling in dough.

## why do you think the new trimotor is still at the dock?

## you know what that would mean?

that was the main idea.

## why?
i had to ground him.

## his eyes?
that's tough.

## why should you?
i guess you misunderstood, lady.

## still figure on quitting?
i guess if you can stand that guy, we've got no right to kick.

## what about me?
i didn't get this by walking into a door.

## who, me?
no, no.

## who's running this airline?
geoff, please.

## what about my passage money?
you don't need it.

## you mean, anything that's a little too tough for somebody else?

## what's the matter?
i don't know.

## can i come in?

no, i skipped that one.

## after that sample, have you still got your chin stuck out for more?
i know i'm a fool, but i can't do anything about it.

## you don't believe that, do you?
you'il have a hard time making him believe it.

## you love him, don't you?
yes, i guess i do.

## why couldn't i be there to meet him when he gets back?
why couldn't i...

## what do you do when he doesn't come back when you expect him to?
i go nuts.

## what's up?

## feeling better, judy?
thanks, geoff.

## now will you tell me what he's done?
no, you'il have to ask him.

## you think that'il be easy to do?
keep on the left, and start dropping after you pass that second peak.

## anything else?
yeah.

## what are you doing here?
just looking for a corkscrew.

## don't you think you'd better get some sleep?
seems like an excellent suggestion.

## that why you're celebrating?
he wouldn't tell me.

## did you ever hear the word\" trust\"?
i did once, but i forgot it.

## you don't know what i'm talking about, do you?

some dude said you hate white people.

## he said,\" why did he say that?
i said,\" in the album, you talk about how the devil stole the music.

## he said,\" he said white people stole music from black people?

## you know?
i'm like,\" go explain that's not what you meant.

## you want to shoot it?
i said,\" okay, and i want to leave early because today is father's day.

## who was she dating?
we already told the savages.

## the savage brothers?
they were here yesterday.

## without a word?
ma, i was gonna tell you.

## just like your father, huh?
that's my brother, ray, and his friend john.

## on sunday morning, brendan?
i was asleep.

## can you confirm that, mrs. harris?
i can confirm that he closed his door at 10:00.

## you think you'd be up for that?
i loved her so much.

## what are you still doing here?
i don't know.

## did annabeth get to sleep?
yeah, i convinced her to take a pill.

## could i get one of those?
yeah.

## hello?
christ.

## oh, me?
i'm tired of wishing things made sense.

## how's jimmy and everybody?
okay.

## dave?
dave.

## about what?
i don't know, honey.

## anyhow, it doesn't matter, does it?
i mean, katie markum is dead.

## yeah, you heard about katie markum?
yeah, i was at jimmy's yesterday.

## who's celeste?
my wife.

## how's jimmy doing?
it's hard to tell.

## pretty drunk, huh?
but it was harmless.

## what time did they leave?
i left at 1.

## so we'il say 12:45?
sounds about right.

## you see anything unusual or anyone...?
michael.

## like what?
i don't know.

## a woman hater?
no.

## you got your milk money?
fuck, i hated school.

## what?

## where did you go after you left mcgill's?
home.

## home by 1:15, would you say?

## we'il grab a beer sometime?
yeah, i'd like that, sean.

## can you believe this?
man, it's the same as dunkin 'donuts.

## what makes her swerve without hitting the brakes?
i don't know.

## she hit hard enough to get a jump on him?
maybe he's knocked back on his heels.

## wait a second, how did we get to dave boyle all of a sudden?

## you seriously want to take a look at dave boyle?
just a little one.

## have you thought about flowers?

## where you off to?
annabeth got a craving for cigarettes.

oh, no.

## why would i even think that?
i don't know.

## did brendan harris kill my daughter?
no.

## you're 100 percent sure?
passed his poly with flying colors, plus it seemed to me like he really loved her.

## why are you so dead set against that kid?
he said katie told him you'd disowned her if she ever dated a harris.

## why is that?
there were so many rays in the neighborhood.

## how about this?
we've interviewed witnesses...... canvassed people who were in the bar.

## so?
so the savages are not policemen, jim.

## you giving us a deadline?
we'il speak for katie, mr. markum.

## yeah, you got a match?
you're gonna love it.

## the flats?
rome basin.

## huh?
i'm sorry.

## scarier than a glass of milk, right?

## so, what you're saying is that it was an inside job?
it had to be.

## still have a copy of those records?
yeah, it's in a box in the office there.

## oh, yeah?
this guy i fired a couple of weeks before.

no, sir.

## you say they used the same gun for another crime?
that's correct, sir.

## where you been?

## what about them?
they're undead...... but i think maybe there's something beautiful about it.

## what the fuck you talking about, dave?
vampires, sweetie.

## you think i killed katie?
celeste.

## where'd you come up with that?
i don't think anything.

## i'm confused, okay?
even your friend sean asked about...

## what'd you tell him?
i said i was asleep.

## henry?
henry and george.

## isn't that fucking hilarious?
at least that's what they called themselves, but...... they were wolves, and dave...... was the boy who escaped from wolves.

## what are you talking about, dave?
i'm talking henry and george.

## you mean, all those years ago...... when you were a little boy?
dave...

## i don't see it that way.
what stays?

## what does just ray's gun have to do with dave?
these things get passed around.

## katie markum was not sexually abused, see?
in that equation, sexual emission is part of the deal.

## it's cold, huh?
yeah, i guess.

## saw who?
katie.

## you saw katie saturday night?
never got around to telling you.

## did you talk to her?

the blood on your front seat, dave.

## what blood type are you?
b negative.

## yeah?
that's the match we got.

## no idea how half a pint of blood got in the trunk?

## what report?
the stolen car report.

## things looking any better on the sprite, sean?

the night train to leningrad.

## i may have mentioned mr potomac books, my new american partner?
well, he's doing leningrad, and he summoned me for a powwow.

## powwow?
i thought you knew english.

## why?
it is our custom before a long journey first to sit down.

## won't that do?
well,... you are supposed to sit on your luggage and sigh a little and cross yourself.

## are you coming back to moscow?
no, not this time.

## school?
work.

## cigarettes, scotch, drugs, currency?
no, thanks.

## you get lost?
that's a good idea.

## why don't you try it?
one down, two to go.

## where are you, dante?
the only two sober people there.

## how are you?
i'm very well.

## you can walk a little?
it is safest to keep moving.

## you came to tell me you refuse to publish me?
dante, you're going too fast.

## what about her?
she also chose.

## have you forgotten your words at peredelkino?
i am not the man you thought i was.

## you like graveyards, barley?
look.

## herr salieri?
leave me alone.

## do you know who i am?
that makes no difference.

## are they?
offer me your confession.

## how well are you trained in music?
i know a little.

## where?
here in vienna.

## what is it?
it was a very popular tune in its day.

## here, how about this?
this one brought down the house.

## can you recall no melody of mine?
i was the most famous composer in europe.

## is it true?
for god's sake, my son...... if you have something to confess...... do it now.

## how could i tell him...... what music meant to me?
lord...... make me a great composer.

## in a few years, i was his court composer.
and do you know what happened?

## isn't that incredible?
every night i sat right next to the emperor of austria...... playing duets with him...... correcting the royal sight reading.

## but what did it matter?
mozart is not here.

## you see?
i've stopped.

## but i love you?
tish i'm tee.

## what?
tee... eat.

## these viennese know good music when they hear it, don't you think?
certainly.

## why must i be humiliated...... in front of my guests, by one of my own servants?
the more license i allow you, the more you take.

## why would god choose an obscene child to be his instrument?
he's remarkable, majesty.

## that?
a most tiresome piece.

## tiresome?
a young man trying to impress beyond his abilities.

## we could use a good german composer in vienna, surely?
i'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer.

## what do you think, chamberlain?
in my opinion, sir, it's time we had a piece in our own language.

## kapellmeister?
majesty...... i must agree with herr direktor.

## court composer...... what do you think?
i think it's an interesting notion to keep mozart in vienna.

## so?
here we go.

## how do you like it?
they're all so beautiful.

## gentlemen...... good morning.
why don't i have three heads?

## what do you have for me today?
your majesty, herr mozart.

## yes, what about him?
he's here.

## may i see?
just a trifle.

## may i try it?
you do me too much honor.

## yes or no?
you know all these gentlemen, i'm sure.

## which one?
mio caro adone.

## really?
well, there it is.

## did we vote in the end for german or italian?
actually, sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to italian.

## did we?
because i've already found the most wonderful libretto.

## have i seen it?
i don't think you have, herr direktor.

## where?
in a harem, majesty.

## you mean in turkey?
yes, exactly.

## then why especially does it have to be in german?
it doesn't, especially.

## why not?
as a foreigner, i'd love to learn.

## on one hearing only?
i think so, sire.

## or this?
yes.

## what do you think?
all i ever wanted...... was to sing to god.

## why?
tell me that.

## and then deny me the talent?
it's turkish.

## and he's been commissioned to write an opera.
does he?

## is it true?
yes.

## is there a part in it for me?
no.

## where?
in a harem.

## what's that?
a brothel.

## mozart?
you might be disappointed.

## why?
looks and talent don't always go together, caterina.

## it is new.
shall we continue?

## it is, isn't it, sire?
yes, indeed.

## of course, now and then... just now and then...... it seemed a touch....
so then, you liked it?

## what do you mean?
well, i mean, occasionally, it seems to have...

## too many notes, your majesty?
exactly.

## i'm right in saying that, aren't i, court composer?
yes.

## please.
which few did you have in mind, majesty?

## when do you marry?
we haven't exactly received my father's consent yet.

## excuse me...... but how old are you?
my heart was filling up...... with such hatred for that little man.

## one more chance?
you have leave to try.

## to conquer here is to conquer europe?
with my wife i can do it.

## what is your view?
it's an interesting idea, majesty.

## why must i submit samples of work to a committee to teach a 13 year old girl?
his majesty wishes it.

## is he angry with me?
quite the contrary.

## then why not appoint me to the post?
you're not the only composer in vienna.

## who is on this committee?
kapellmeister bonno, count orsini rosenberg...... and of course, court composer salieri.

## must i?
well, i won't.

## frau mozart?
i've come on behalf of my husband.

## how charming, but... why did he not come himself?
he's terribly busy, sir.

## would it be too much trouble to ask you to look at them now?
while i wait.

## then he didn't send you?
no, sir.

## just like your husband.
do you know what these are?

## are you sure you can't...... leave this and come back again?
it's very tempting, sir.

## originals?
yes, sir.

## i was staring through the cage...... of those meticulous ink strokes...... at an absolute beauty.
these...... are originals?

## he's very proud of his work.
it's not good?

## you will help us?
from now on we are enemies...... you and i.

## is she not here?
no, she had to help her mother.

## why don't you get up now?
she's very tired, poor creature.

## no maid?
no.

## how is your...... financial situation?
couldn't be better.

## what do you mean?
it's wonderful.

## that one will.
who?

## what's that?
confess it.

## i look dreadful.
could you want a prettier daughter?

## are you expecting?
yes, i am.

## isn't it marvelous?
we're delighted.

## this calls for a feast.
may i offer you some tea?

## let's go dancing.
you don't want tea, do you?

## there's a young girl here to see you.
papa loves parties, don't you?

## what's she want?
she won't talk to me.

## are you herr mozart?
that's right.

## are you playing a trick on me?
i've never seen her.

## what is ridiculous?
wolfie has many admirers in vienna.

## whoever sent you is going to pay?
that's right, ma'am.

## could you wait outside?
yes, ma'am.

## we can't do anything right for you, can we?
you won't have to do anything for me ever again.

## thank you, sir.
but what do you expect?

## do any pupils come to the house?
not that i've seen.

## does he work at all?
i wouldn't know that, sir.

## what?
he kept seven snuff boxes in here.

## where does he work?
i have just heard some news that may be of interest to you.

## what?
mozart is writing a new opera.

## italian?
that's not all.

## he is setting that play to music?
yes.

## what is this marriage of figaro?
it's a french play, kapellmeister.

## you're absolutely sure?
gentlemen, sit down.

## are you aware that i have declared the french play of figaro...... unsuitable for our theatre?
yes, sire.

## who told you?
it is not your place to ask questions.

## is it true?
yes.

## would you tell me why?
majesty, it is only a comedy.

## how long do you think i can sustain that?
i have no idea.

## well...... 6?
7 minutes.

## even with the politics taken out of it, it would still remain a vulgar farce.
8 minutes?

## why waste your spirit on such rubbish?
i am fed...... to the teeth with these...... elevated things.

## why must we go on forever...... writing only about gods and legends?
or horatius or orpheus.

## you know how much work i did?
his majesty has been...... more than patient.

## how can i persuade you if i can't show it?
that will do.

## show how it begins?
please.

## and do you know why?
not from any oppression, no.

## do you know what for?
his bed.

## what anger?
about the ballet.

## excuse me...... but didn't his majesty specifically...... forbid the ballet at his opera?
a word with you.

## do you not know that his majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in operas?
it's not a ballet, it's a dance at figaro's wedding.

## what are you doing?
taking out what you should never have put in.

## what is it?
it's unbelievable.

## why bother with rosenberg?
he's no friend of yours.

## you burned the score?
no, my wife took it out in time.

## excellency...... would you?
with all my heart, mozart.

## what is this?
i don't understand.

## is it modern?
the herr direktor...... he has removed un balletto...... that would have occurred at this place.

## why?
it's your regulation.

## do you like this?
it's not a question of liking.

## still, if the public doesn't like one's work...... one has to accept the fact gracefully.
and then... do you know what happened?

## but what is it they don't like?
i can speak for the emperor.

## did you like it at all?
i thought it was marvelous.

## why didn't they come?
i think you overestimate our dear viennese, my friend.

## how could i not?
bravo, maestro.

## did my work please you?
i never knew that music like that was possible.

## yes, my love?
these gentlemen are from salzburg.

## what work?
a mass for the dead.

## who's dead?
a man who deserved a requiem mass...... and never got one.

## who are you?
i am only a messenger.

## do you accept?
you'il be well paid.

## do you accept?
work fast.

## the only thing that worried me...... was the actual killing.
what?

## how does one kill a man?
i see you brought your manager with you.

## i'm talking about now.
well, madame...... how about...... half the receipts?

## how much will you pay him now?
down payment.

## who do you think i am, the emperor?
i have to go.

## don't answer it.
why not?

## why?
tell him i'm not here.

## am i interrupting something?
no.

## where's our friend?
he's not here.

## i'm sorry.
is that it?

## the vaudeville, what do you think?
yes.

## can i see it?
no.

## why not?
because there's nothing to see.

## where is it?
here.

## what's so intelligent about a requiem?
money.

## what's the matter with you?
i'm not working there anymore.

## what has happened?
you don't know what it's like.

## when he speaks he makes no sense.
is he working?

## is he working?
i don't have it yet.

## are you neglecting my request?
i promise you.

## i've been sick but i'm all right now, aren't i?
yes, sir.

## can you give me one reason i can understand?
it's killing me.

## you're drunk, aren't you?
pick him up.

## is it over?
she's not well either.

## who?
the man.

## can we come in?
better not.

## he's all right?
yes, he's just exhausted.

## tell him we came by, won't you?
of course.

## what happened?
back to vienna.

## now?
yes.

## why?
i feel wrong.

## where did i stop?
the end of the recordare.

## how would you translate that?
consigned to flames of woe.

## you believe in it?
a fire which never dies, burning you forever.

## is it possible?
common time.

## you see?
yes.

## d sharp?
of course.

## trombone with what?
tenors.

## and that's all?
no.

## altos on\" c,\" sopranos above.
do you have it?

## that's it.
sopranos up to\" f\" on the second voca?

## you have it?
you go too fast.

## of what?
i was foolish.

## what are you doing here?
your husband...... took sick.

## why you?
because madame, i was at hand.

## what is this?
no, wolfie, not this.

## herr salieri?
leave me alone.

## do you know who i am?
that makes no difference.

## are they?
offer me your confession.

## how well are you trained in music?
i know a little.

## where?
here in vienna.

## what is it?
it was a very popular tune in its day.

## here, how about this?

## well?
i regret it is not too familiar.

## can you recall no melody of mine?
i was the most famous composer in europe.

## is it true?
for god's sake, my son...... if you have something to confess, do it now.

## how could i tell him...... what music meant to me?
while my father prayed earnestly to god...... to protect commerce......

## in a few years, i was his court composer.
and do you know what happened?

## isn't that incredible?
every night i sat with the emperor of austria...... playing duets with him...... correcting the royal sight reading.

## but what did it matter?
he adored my music.

## if you had been me...... wouldn't you have thought god had accepted your vow?
mozart is not here.

## you see?
i've stopped.

## why?
people fart backwards.

## but i love you?
tihs ym tae.

## what?
eat.

## i think that went well, don't you?
indeed.

## the viennese know good music, don't you think?
certainly.

## why do i have to be humiliated in front of my guests...... by one of my own servants?
the more license i allow you, the more you take.

## why would god choose an obscene child to be his instrument?
it was not to be believed.

## how good is he, this mozart?
he's remarkable, majesty.

## that?
a tiresome piece.

## tiresome?
a young man trying to impress beyond his abilities.

## we could use a good german composer in vienna, surely?
i'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer.

## what do you think, chamberlain?

just a...

## may i try it?
you do me too much honor.

## yes or no?
you know all these gentlemen.

\" mio caro adone.

## really?
well, there it is.

## did we vote in the end for german or italian?
sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to italian.

## did we?
i don't think it was really decided, your majesty.

## why so?
because i've already found the most wonderful libretto.

## have i seen it?
i don't think you have,\" herr direktor\".

## where?
in a harem, majesty.

## you mean in turkey?
yes, exactly.

## then why especially does it have to be in german?
it doesn't, especially.

## why not?
it's charming.

## excuse me, majesty, but what do you think these could be?

## on one hearing only?
i think so, sire.

## or this?
this.

## what do you think?
grazie, signore.

## why?
tell me that.

## and then deny me the talent?
madame cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.

## how do you like it?
it's turkish.

## and he's been commissioned to write an opera.
does he?

## is it true?
yes.

## is there a part in it for me?
no.

## where?
in a harem.

## what's that?
a brothel.

## mozart?
you might be disappointed.

## why?
looks and talent don't always go together, katerina.

## shall we continue?
there she was.

## it is, isn't it, sire?
yes, indeed.

## of course, now and then, just now and then...... it seemed a touch...
so then, you liked it?

## what do you mean, sire?
well, i mean, occasionally, it seems to have...

## too many notes, majesty?
exactly.

## i think i'm right in saying that, aren't i, court composer?
yes.

i told him that, but he won't listen to me.

## may i...?
well, there it is.

## excuse me.
wolfie, will you get some water?

## what?
the marriage.

## what does it matter to you?
nothing.

## how was i?
you were sublime.

## and what did you think of the music?
extremely clever.

## is that woman still lying on the floor?
no, she's fine.

## it's the best music in vienna today, don't you agree?
she must be dazzling in bed.

## can we go home?
yes.

## won't you introduce us, wolfgang?
it's very possible.

## why choose mozart to teach me lessons in humility?
my heart was filling up...... with such hatred for that little man.

## give him one more chance?
you have leave to try.

## what is your view?
it's an interesting idea, majesty, but...

## yes?
my concern is to protect you...... from any hint of favoritism.

## why must i submit samples of my work to a committee to teach a girl?
because his majesty wishes it.

## is the emperor angry with me?
quite the contrary.

## then why not appoint me to the post?
you are not the only composer in vienna.

## who is on this committee?
young man...... the issue is quite simple.

## must i?
well, i won't.

## do you want me to beg on the streets?
don't be stupid.

## i know how things work in this city.
what's wrong with that?

## yes?
excuse me, sir.

## who?
she didn't say, but she says it's urgent.

## frau mozart?
i've come on behalf of my husband.

## how charming, but why did he not come himself?
well, he's terribly busy, sir.

## would it be too much trouble to ask you to look at them now?
while i wait.

## then he didn't send you?
no, sir.

## just like your husband.
do you know what these are?

## are you sure you can't...... leave this and come back again?
it's very tempting, sir.

## originals?
yes, sir.

## i was staring through the cage...... of those meticulous ink strokes...... at an absolute beauty.
these...... are originals?

## is it not good?
it is miraculous.

## so you will help us?
i dine with the emperor tomorrow evening.

## tonight?

some service deserves service in return.

## isn't it obvious?

well...

## or don't we need to bother anymore?
suppose we don't, really.

## what's the matter?
tell me.

## really?
one of my own pupils, a very young singer...... maria theresa paradis...... told me she was...

## well, what?
molested, majesty.

## whom did they choose?
herr zummer.

## without pupils, i can't manage.
herr zummer?

## you don't mean you're living in poverty?
no, but i'm broke.

## well, how is this possible?
i hear your concerts are quite successful.

## seriously...... is there any chance you could manage a loan?
only for six months.

## you expect your fortunes to change in six or eight months?
as a matter of fact, i do.

## what is it?
it's cream cheese mixed with sugar...... suffused with rum.

## what exactly are you working on?
really, i can't say.

## which of them do you wish me to teach?
that's funny.

## right,\" herr mozart\"?
perhaps it would be better if we were left alone.

## goodbye, sir.
why don't you let me try?

## am i not welcome?
of course, welcome.

## doesn't your wife feed you?
no, she had to help her mother.

## why don't you get up now, my darling?
she's very tired, poor creature.

## don't you have a maid?
oh.

## how is your...... financial situation?
couldn't be better.

## what do you mean?
it's wonderful.

## that one will.
who?

## what's that?
it's a secret.

## secret?
now, papa, confess it.

## i look dreadful.
could you want a prettier daughter?

## are you...... expecting?
yes, i am.

## isn't it marvelous?
we're delighted.

## this calls for a feast.
may i offer you some tea?

## let's go dancing.
you don't want tea, do you?

## before i leave this earth...... i will laugh at you.
papa loves parties, don't you?

## what?
there's a young girl here to see you.

## what does she want?
she won't talk to me.

## are you\" herr mozart\"?
that's right.

## are you playing a trick on me?
i've never seen this girl.

## is this some kind of joke?
wolfie has many admirers in vienna.

## whoever sent you is going to pay?
that's right.

## could you please wait outside?
yes, ma'am.

## we can't do anything right for you, can we?
you won't have to do anything for me ever again.

## it's a pigsty.

mozart is writing a new opera.

## italian?
that's not all.

## he's setting that play to music?
yes.

## what is this\" marriage of figaro\"?
it's a french play, kapellmeister.

## you're absolutely sure?
herr mozart.

## are you aware that i have declared the french play\" figaro\"...... unsuitable for our theater?
yes, sire.

## who told you this, majesty?
it is not your place to ask questions.

## is it true?
yes, i...

## would you tell me why?
majesty, it is only a comedy.

## how long do you think i can sustain that?
i have no idea.

## eight minutes?
twenty, sire.

## why waste your spirit on such rubbish?
i am fed to the teeth with these...... elevated things.

## why must we go on forever writing of gods and legends?
because they do.

## do you know how much work went into it?
his majesty has been more than patient,\" signore\".

## how can i persuade if i can't show it?
that will do,\" herr mozart\".

## just that?
please.

## do you know why?
not from oppression.

## do you know what for?
his bed.

## what anger?
about the ballet.

## yes?
it's not a ballet, it's a dance.

## what is it?
it's unbelievable.

## can't you talk to him?
please.

## why bother?
he's no friend of yours.

## you burned the score?
no, my wife took it out in time.

## excellency...... would you?
with all my heart, mozart.

## what is this?
i don't understand.

## is it modern?
majesty...... the\" herr direktor\"...... he has removed\" un balletto\"...... that would have occurred at this place.

## why?
it is your regulation, sire.

## do you like this?
it's not a question of liking, majesty.

## making my defeat more bitter with every passing bar.
can we see the scene with the music, please?

## still, if the public doesn't like one's work...... one has to accept the fact gracefully.
and then, do you know what happened?

## but what is it that they don't like?
i can speak for the emperor.

## did you like it at all?
i think you overestimate our dear viennese, friend.

## how could i not?
bravo, maestro.

## did my work please you?
i never knew that music like that was possible.

## yes, my love?

## why?

## what do you mean, an order?
in 1981, mr. keaton,...... you participated in the hijacking of a truck in buffalo, new york.

## what about redfoot?
mr. redfoot knew nothing.

## so... why telling us?
i don't think that is very relevant, mr. hockney.

## what's your point?
the offer is this, gentlemen.

## who was that guy who used to talk about soze in new york?
he's supposed to be turkish.

## do you believe in him, verbal?
i don't believe in god, but i'm afraid of him.

## you give any weight to this?
i can introduce you to dan metzheiser from justice.

## what, on the street?
a few times.

## so what if i left out how i got there?
it's so full of holes, the d. a. would have told me to blow amnesty up my ass.

## well, you tell me, agent kujan... if i told you the loch ness monster... hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?
turn state's evidence.

## what can you possibly offer me?
if there really is a keyser soze, he's gonna come looking for you.

## where do you think the pressure's coming from?
keyser soze, or whatever you want to call him...... he knows where i am right now.

## so why play into his hands?
we can protect you.

## you think a guy like that comes this close to getting caught...... and sticks his head out?
if he comes up for anything, it will be to get rid of me.

## what happened next?

## i did see keaton get shot, i swear to you.

## what if you miss?
all right.

## what?
no.

## you say soze sent us to kill someone?
i'm saying keaton did.

## if you all knew that soze could find you anywhere...... why did he give you the money to run?
he could have used you on the boat.

## shot twice in the head.

listen, sheriff, i'm really sorry... to have awoken you from your slumber, but it's over.

## remember you came to me, said,\" you wanna be a cop?
i'm bein 'a cop.

## then how come figgis didn't do somethin 'about it?
he was ray's right hand man back then.

## freddy, look, i don't know about ray, okay?
but everyone in garrison is not a murderer.

## two in the center?
uh uh.

## so what do i got to do?
five out of six in the star.

## you a cop too?
yeah, yeah, i heard ya.

you know, maybe they're doin 'the right thing.

## i. a.?
now, i don't need this opened up.

## now, who are you to judge that until you've walked in his shoes?
maybe that's what you're tryin 'to do with me.

## so now you can do us a favor, huh?
you could tell us...

## that lady cop... from the bomb squad got you the stuff to do this with, didn't she?
you didn't know monica was gonna be here.

## did you, figgs?
no.

## why the hell would i tell you if i did?
rose, i'm his only chance.

## you workin 'with the feds?
no.

## i. a.?
no.

## bill, where are you?
bill, if you read, we're going back to the station.

## you don't know what you're doing do you?
shut up.

## bill, do you read?
it's just club soda, freddy.

## you got him at the station?
ray, there's gotta be a way out of this for everyone.

## you know the difference between men and boys?
boys bet everything on everything.

## now, that's not what you want, is it?
i look at this town... and i don't like what i see anymore.

## who the fuck do you think you are?
just drop the keys.

## there's nothing i can say?
okay, then 6:00 it is.

## who was he supposed to call?

## how have you been?
never better.

## this isn't going to be a problem, is it?
no.

## what about his first born?
ben...

## 25 % of a billion is enough to keep the lights on for a while, isn't it?
maybe even pay off your fourth mortgage on the baxter building.

## deal?
hilarious.

## what's the worst that can happen?
if reed's right, this little trip could double our stock offerings.

## when are we leaving?
i'il be scheduling the launch... so you can call me in the morning for resources and crew.

## remember my brother, johnny?
can't do it.

## when have i ever asked you to do something... you absolutely said you could not do?
five times.

## i mean, who the hell came up with these?
victor did.

## long way from the projection booth at the hayden planetarium, isn't it?
yes.

## is it safe?
the shields on the station should protect us.

## getting paranoid in your old age?
let's start loading those samples.

## got it?
so take a walk, ben.

## yes, well, his eyes say differently, don't they?
i understand the business reasons.

## what are you doing?
closing the shields.

## where am i?
back on earth.

## sue?
they're fine.

## what's wrong with me?
i swear to you, ben.

## how's she doing?
stable and her vitals are strong.

## you're enjoying this, aren't you, ned?
one week.

## where do we think we're going?
i don't know if we've noticed... but the sickest runs this side of the alps are right outside that window.

## do you wanna help me with this zipper?
you know, this is not a ski resort.

## listen, when do you get off work?
hey.

## how are you feeling?
solid.

## that was a close one, though, huh?
yeah.

## what was that about?
i don't know.

## what?
come on.

## do i have to do everything myself?
i can only stay for one drink 'cause i have to meet victor.

## reed, what are you doing here?
i thought...

## from reed's disaster?
get me on the a. m.

## and that's a good thing?
you know, maybe you should get some rest.

## sir, i have always wondered, why sue?
you could have any other woman in the world.

## you all right?
yeah, bad shrimp.

## you're really happy for me and victor?
i can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship.

## which was?
passion... for science.

## it's been two years, and all you can say is that you're happy... for me and some other guy?
victor may be a lot of things.

## you are never gonna believe what just happened to me.
what do you mean, you can't?

## what?
well, i can explain this.

## what?
the cloud has fundamentally altered our dna.

## and you know what, guys?
i think i was flying.

## all right?
i might.

## anybody?
just break the glass.

## ben?
look.

## victor, are you feeling all right?
i'm fine.

## symptoms?
victor, i should have...

## anybody got any ideas where the big guy's going?
he's going home.

## debs?
it's me.

## where are you?
i'm over here.

## don't come any closer for a sec, okay?
it's gonna be a bit of a shock.

## debs... remember when we used to say... together forever no matter what?
yeah.

## everybody all right?
i saw him.

## what's the worst that could happen?
hey, little guy.

## you're not afraid of me, are you?
you take a good look, pal.

## how bad could it be, right?
i don't think you...

## we'il tell you when you can go.
you wanna be scared?

## what do we do now?
we're not going to get past these guys.

## you wanna hit the button, sir?
sue.

## what?
i'm gonna need therapy.

## we got through, didn't we?
just find ben.

## stay here, okay?
i'm coming.

## where are your ears?
i'm gonna go talk to them.

## which one of you is the leader?
that would be me.

## is it true you can fly?
i was planning to use the publicity.

## do you know how much money i've invested in this company?
victor, stop.

## is all that for you, dr. richards?
i'm afraid so.

## how come ben can't turn it on and off like we can?
that's what we're here to find out.

## you mean, like, we won't be able to turn it off, either?
that would save time.

## is that a trick question?
grow up.

## am i the only guy who thinks this is cool?
we should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes... and figure out how to reverse them.

## so, what do you think?
i don't know, reed, i think you might be bringing your work home with you.

## what about the rumours of a takeover?
god, i was so worried about you.

## victor, what are you doing here?
i'm starting to wonder the same thing.

## how much do you know about what happened to you?
not much.

## didn't go as planned?
it was a catastrophe.

## abort?
no.

## why didn't you just say so?
his internal organs are completely solid.

## how bad is it?
you know, i used to smoke.

## excuse me?
i'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger.

## can you remember your exact emotions on the bridge?
anger.

## is there any way to duplicate that feeling?
some memory or...

## you feel anything?
nope.

## how's that coming?
i'm so sorry.

## are you okay?
yeah, fine.

## you sure?
yeah.

## are you kidding?
no.

## what was so complicated about that?
there were a lot of variables to consider.

## do you feel anything right now?
hey, guys.

## so what's the prognosis?
your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing.

## and it's changing into?
i don't really know.

## how long?
at this rate, the infection could be complete in two, maybe three weeks.

## what do you mean complete?
i wish i could tell you.

## what?
centre for disease control.

## can i help you, buddy?
oh, my.

## johnny, can you put that napkin out?
jesus.

## how're you going to cure us?
i'm going to build a machine to recreate the storm.

## what, no pop ups?
lf i can reverse the wave signal...

## but what are the risks?
even a small miscalculation could increase our symptoms exponentially... or perhaps even kill us.

## that's bad, right?
i say we just let sleeping dogs lie, guys.

## so how long till this contraption's up and running?
i don't know, it's hard to say.

## how long, reed?
i don't know.

## you don't know?
you don't want this to get worse.

## worse than that?
guys, look, we're gonna be stuck here for a while, so let's just try and get along.

## about the ipo, no hard feelings, right?
nothing personal.

## flame boy never listens.
where's your hot sister and the monster?

## yeah, it's sort of armani meets astronaut.
what did he do to his uniform?

## so what are your superhero names?
they call me the human torch.

## what do you call that thing?
no.

## you gave us names?
you don't think.

## we need to be careful until we're normal again.
so now you're the face of the fantastic four?

## no, ben.
what if i don't wanna be normal?

## what?
you need to control yourself and think before you act.

## you know what, reed?
this is who we are.

## together?
susie, look at me.

## can i?
careful.

## what are you doing here?
i was worried about you.

## you were worried about me?
that's sweet.

## reed?
i was just resting my eyes.

## when are the next tests?
i've run out of plans.

## reed?
i should get back to work.

## remember our first date here?
god, i was nervous.

## really?
i gave him $20.

## well, why didn't you say something?
reed, i'm saying it now.

## you know what i mean, scarface?
i'm just saying i know what it's like to lose something that you love... to see it slip away and know it's never coming back.

## reed is gonna fix me up, okay?
for your sake i hope you're right.

## so what possible reason could he have for taking his time?
i mean, other than spending more time with sue.

## do you also remember what you swore to do... with every breath in your body?
we're working as hard as we can.

## victor?
that was the prototype.

## johnny, have you seen ben?
yeah, sunshine just left.

## you're calling that the real world?
sue, stop.

## don't talk to me like i'm a little boy, okay?
maybe i would if you stopped acting like one.

## why is everyone on my ass?
if you guys are jealous, that's fine.

## you live your life, i'il live mine.
you really think those people out there care about you?

## oh, my god, reed.
sound good?

## what did you do?
i can make it work.

## more power?
you need a doctor.

## where do you think?
with sue.

## what do you want, vic?
to help you.

## and you can?
yes.

## tell me... do you want to be ben grimm again?
thank you.

## vic?
vic, it worked.

## vic?
right on cue.

## what did you do?
exactly what i said i would.

## mr. von doom, are you okay?
never better, jimmy.

## why the long face?
let's talk in my office.

## you all right, ben?
put him on the step.

## what happened, big guy?
i leave you for five minutes...

## where's reed?
vic must have taken him.

## give up?
that's not like you, reed.

## painful?
you don't know the meaning of the word.

## never do.
let's check in on the rest of the family, shall we?

## you have to stay here.
what are you doing?

## sue.
what did i do?

## what has he done to you?
how romantic.

## do you really think fate turned us into gods so we could refuse these gifts?
victor, you always thought you were a god.

## damn, i've been waiting to do that.
did you say goodbye to your brother johnny?

## he's just a little larger than life,\" right?
i'il be right with you.

## had a little relapse, huh?
flame on, kid.

## is that the best you can do?
time for your lesson.

## come on.
what happens when you rapidly cool hot metal?

## sue, you okay?
yeah.

## job, huh?
well, we do have the suits.

## can i talk to you for a second?
sure.

## a gasket?
reed, come on, we're at a party.

## sue storm... will you marry me?
should be about 12 days.

## reed, what are we doing here?

## you didn't forget about me, did you?
oh, god.

## pass on a little message for me, will ya?
sheriff, i've been compiling info... based on eyewitness reports of the hockey mask killer.

## stopped who before?
we don't say his name out loud.

## why don't we all just leave?

## i mean, what kind of a pussy... comes after you in your dreams anyway?
now, that big ass mother fucker back at the cornfield... all right, that's who we should be afraid of.

## how'd you know we were here?
nothing personal, but the scooby van out back... wasn't exactly subtle.

## cause somebody's definitely breaking... the fucking reality rules, ok?
it makes sense in a way.

## how can we use that?
i think we should concentrate on jason first.

## shouldn't we go after him first?
i don't know, maybe what we need to do is... to offer freddy a sacrifice.

## like a virgin, right?
