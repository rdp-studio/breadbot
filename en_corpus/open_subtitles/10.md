## Have you cooked the burgers?
Yes.

No, no, no.

...yes I'm still on hold...

## That's it.

It's not mine.

## Why's it here?
I have no idea.

## ....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?
You're so scared.

It doesn't matter.

Well. I have no way of knowing. So it doesn't matter.

It doesn't matter.

Sometimes when I'm lonely.

Not very late.

Yes.

## Can I ask you a question?
Uh-huh.

## Remember last night I was talking to you and I was telling you about my apartment, my rent -- ? Do you remember?
Yes.

## Me?
Yeah.

## Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.

## You have trouble, financial trouble?
Yeah. It's so hard these days and I really need it.

## So you think you can?
No. I'm sorry.

## Hello?
We got disconnected before....

## I need help.
No. No. We got disconnect -- why?.....you're calling me at work....how did you get this number -- ?

## I know I did. But I don't.
Should I just ask your girlfriend? Maybe I should call back and talk to your girlfriend?

## You lied to me?
I didn't lie.

## Why did you tell me you did, then?
This is....illegal....I'll call the police.

## Are you telling me no?
No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....

## Hello?
You've just made a war that you cannot afford.

Let's go to the hospital.

Yes.

## Is this where you live?
Yes.

No.

## GIRL What is this, man?
I'm sorry.

## GIRL Are you serious with this?
Yes. Sorry.

## GIRL Well....what do you want, then?
Each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...it's for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...

## What are you doing?
Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.

## Are you going to the party tonight?
Yes I am.

## What are you doing?
Nothing.

## Right now, you're doing nothing?
I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing.

## What time are you gonna be there?
Seven o'clock.

## When can you leave?
As soon as you want.

## Can we maybe ask for more money on this?
So they'll go.

## What did you say?
Nothing.

## Are you learning how to play the piano? What is that?
I'll go pay for my car.

## Are you sure?
Yeah.

## Are you ready?
Bye, Barry.

## So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?
Ok.

## Ok. What should I do about Eric?
Just tell him to call me.

## So...did my brother call you?
No.

## Should I call you later?
I'll just see you when you get back here.

## MAUPAS I don't believe it. The Marquis de Sade? You're actually publishing his novels?
Of course, everything's not as harmonious as it seems. I hope you've a strong constitution.

## You've been to his quarters, haven't you?
Once or twice.

## I think she's sweet on him, that's what I think.
Then what's he doing here?

## Then how can we know who is truly good, and who is evil?
The next time you feel the urge to visit the Marquis, I hope you'll come to confession instead.

## Has he hurt you?
His stinking breath caused my eyes to run, that's all.

## But why must you indulge in his pornography?
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.

## Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan?
Charenton has changed; it's not safe for you here.

## I've you to look after me, haven't I?
Don't turn us out, Abbe.

## By whom? The Marquis?
Mother's not half so blind as you.

## Why not?
They incite us to act. In ways we should not... cannot... a lesson the Marquis would do well to learn.

## I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
What? What've I done?

## Conversation, like certain portions of the anatomy, always runs more smoothly when it's lubricated.
You'd deny a dying man his salvation?

## In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters.
I should've told you it was the blood of Christ; you'd believe that, wouldn't you?

## I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?
Enough to discern its tenor.

## I write of the great, eternal truths that bind together all mankind! The whole world over, we eat, we shit, we fuck, we kill and we die.
And --?

## But we also fall in love; we build cities, we compose symphonies, and we endure. Why not put that in your books as well?
It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.

## But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.

## You among them?
You've a touch of the poet, too; perhaps you should take up the quill.

## You mean to take us all down with you?
Don't be absurd; it's only a play.

## How can one man possibly be so selfish?
His rug.

## WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE?
Because your writing continues, unchecked.

## What on earth would that require?
A night spent with the partner of my choice.

## You expect me to pimp Madeleine?
I wasn't talking about Madeleine.

## An innocent child is dead.
Oh, I'm to be blamed now, am I?

## So many authors are denied the gratification of a concrete response to their work. I am blessed, am I not?
IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.

## I dare you. Stab my flesh. Which one of us will bleed?
Of course.

## If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?
It seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy.

## Why is he in your care, and not a proper prison?
His wife's influence.

## His wife's?
Better to have an insane spouse than a criminal one.

## And he's never once attempted escape?
Oh. That.

## Well...?
It's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind.

## Do you favor its publication?
I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.

## Yes?
Unless we set Charenton on a straight and narrow course, she'll be shut down forever by order of the Emperor.

## Shut down?
You're a sentimental man.

## Well?
I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.

## And --?
It was fiction, of course.

## What could cause a tincture like this?
He'll do no such thing.

## You'd suffer in her stead?
As you say, Doctor.

## He was so impressed with the Marquis' tale that he chose to re-enact it, yes?
Perhaps you'll be so kind as to remind me of her name...

## How is the patient faring?
Poorly.

## Will you sleep soundly tonight?
No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect to sleep again.

## Yes?
No one can fault Napoleon for merely bringing a man to his senses.

## Charenton? The administrator there is quite well-loved, is he not?
I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.

## Do you know how I define \"idealism,\" Monsieur Delben?
I don't shed tears over the past, Monsieur Delben; I look to the future.

## Now's not the time to be cheeky, Maddy.
Sweet, then? Like the pastry?

## It's because of the Marquis, isn't it?
I'm hungry for a proper visit.

## Did I frighten you?
It's the only frontier I have left, plumcake.

## Is it awfully violent?
Most assuredly.

## Is it terribly erotic?
Fiendishly so.

## Must I administer them directly, or might I blow them?
The price, my coquette, is every bit as firm as I am...

## What have they done to you now?
They decreed me a savage, and now they have made me one.

## How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
You could whisper it through the walls of your cell.

## You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
No. But tell him I would.

## With all due respect, Madame, all France is familiar with your husband. Grant us a moment alone, won't you, Monsieur Prouix?
I assume you've come to plead for clemency on your husband's behalf.

## But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?
It's tainted money, Doctor.

## What thought is that?
That ill-gotten funds, borne of his degeneracy, might now effect his salvation.

## Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?
Of course.

## Hm? Tell me. What other treats?
....shame on you, truly...

## How was I to tell you? By writing a letter? WITH WHAT, MY ASININE BRIDE?
I beg you, Donatien... as your wife... your only ally... you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself.

## They've put you up to this, haven't they?
You ought to court the Doctor's favor, not his contempt.

## Do as I say.
It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it?

## Doesn't that please you?
Very much.

## You're just scared.
You prefer a book to your husband's company?

## With about twenty of his spies on my tail. No thanks.
Am I?

## But I am That's the killer, honey.
It's not so bad here. After all, what girl doesn't want to live in a castle?

## And director.
Who are you, sir?

## I see. And you are in California for what reason?
To make pictures.

## Over at RKO?
Mm. Not a very good picture I am told.

## You know that can't happen.
Apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you follow so far?

## Why is that, Louis?
Bel Air is restricted.

## The S.E.C. has turned down my request for relief on the debts.
See what you can do about this CITIZEN KANE picture, won't you?

## We're 125 million dollars in debt?
Yes.

## How does one get 125 million dollars in debt?
It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.

## How so?
The jigsaw puzzles and the, urn, career -- the man spending a fortune to make her a star -- only it's opera and not movies. And...

## Yes?
The drinking.

## Sir?
Sir, I-

## Huh?
What we are going to do is shoot life -- in all it's joyous complexity.

## Cut the malarkey, buddy. The boss himself wants me to see the picture today.
Now, Orson, you know I'm just dyin' to see your picture and I know it's gonna be boffo, but you're writing about a publisher, right?

## Oh for God's sake, Louella-
He personally asked you to?

## Can I talk to Hearst?
The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.

## Then let him. What have we got to lose, you and I?
So, who is he? We have to know him.

## How?
Like a jewel. Turn it in the light and a different facet is illuminated.

## Hearst looks down at the world at his feet Everything has always been beneath him.
Why her?

## What?
Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think we need to change the name.

## I don't care.
The title?

## Hedy Lamarr?
Believe you me, they're gonna do anything -- and I mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from gettin' out.

## Is that from one of the Gospels?
Kinda.

## George...
YOU STUPID, LITTLE MAN! HOW COULD YOU HAVE LET THIS HAPPEN?! I GAVE YOU MY SOUL AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO SELL IT!?

## What have I done?
Aw, cheer up, George'll probably be running Fox by the morning. Let's get a drink.

## Yeah, ain't it swell?
They came to me with an offer. 800,000 for the negative and all the prints.

## Excuse me, I hope this isn't rude, but aren't you Marion Davies?
Yes.

## To do what?
That's for me to decide.

## Pardon?
CITIZEN KANE There's your title.

## And this is the evening edition. Notice anything?
The Palace in New York. But Orson there's something else.

## Relax, George. It's gonna go great. Trust me. Have I ever lied to you?
You know something, Orson, you haven't done anything but lie to me from the moment we met. But, ya know, I'd do it again in a second.

## Without me. I'm afraid. I got the axe this morning.
It was fun, wasn't it?

## We done?
We're from...

## About what?
I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.

## Tommy, thanks for coming over.
For what?

## You just take it easy, now. You'll do all right. Feelin' Ok?
I'm Ok.

## Just come by to wish you luck. Need anything?
No, we're all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy.

## Aside from everything else, your family all right?
Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.

## How can he embarrass you?
I'd like to talk to Jake a minute.

## What who's been sayin'?
You were a big favorite in this fight. Then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you're a 12-5 underdog.

## What?
You got any money you want to bet on Billy Fox, you can put it right here... 'cause Jake LaMotta don't go down for nobody.

## Where you going at this hour?
What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.

## And where you goin'?
None of your fuckin' business.

## What's wrong?
Nothing...

## Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.

## You know?
Yeah. Do me a favor.

## Sure. What is it?
Hit me in the face.

## You want me to do what?
You heard me, I said hit me.

## What was that for? I know you can take punches. I can hit you from now to doomsday. What the fuck does that prove?
See that, I don't feel it. I can take it. I know I can take anybody.

## Go 'head.
Who's that?

## How do you know? You know her that good?
No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.

## She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.

## Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I know her from around here, that's all. You want to meet her or what?
Nah, not now -- all those hard-ons around. I'll wait. Not now.

## Do you see her yet?
Give me a chance. Let me look.

## You want us to wait for you?
No, take her home. I wanna be alone for a while. Everybody go.

## You want the title shot?
Say what you're gonna say.

## You want the title shot or not?
Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass.

## Whatcha doin'?
I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...

## What do you mean?
Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.

## I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand?
Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.

## What did Tommy say?
I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is...

## What? I just said hello. Since when I can't kiss my sister-in-law?
Ain't a cheek ever good enough for you? I never even kissed Mama on the mouth.

## How's that?
I can't tell. You're stomach's in the way.

## When?
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.

## Why didn't you tell me about it?
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.

## Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
No, I just told you what happened.

## Who did it have anything to do with... Vickie?
Well, I heard some things.

## What?
You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...

## What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?
When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.

## What?
I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met.

## Stop it. What're you, crazy?
I'm tellin' you now, when I read this, it better not make me look bad.

## Jake, did I ever make you look bad before?
Maybe it wasn't you, but you know what I'm talkin' about.

## You just fought Sugar Ray two weeks ago and you're training like this right now... Are you afraid Sugar Ray might beat you this time?
I tell you what. You hit me here. Sugar Ray hits me here. I can't tell the difference. I just fight.

## Why did they have to stop it? Why did they have to stop it?
It ain't worth it, Jake. Get out.

## What time is it?
Nine o'clock.

## At night?
Yeah. At night.

## How many pounds I gotta lose?
Three more, I figure.

## Joey said you wanted to meet me. Is that right? You wanted to meet me?
I just wanted to say hello.

## Ya hear, Joey? She thinks this face is cute? Hey, whatcha doin' now? You wanna go for a ride?
You don't talk very much.

## That's it. Just grip up a little tighter. That's it. You're gonna be real good at this. How does that feel?
It feels real good.

## Should I hit it?
Just give it a nice little tap.

## Can you see it?
No.

## What does that mean?
Jake, this is your father's bedroom.

## Are you sure we should be doing this?
Come over here.

## Who asked you?
But, Jake, I was just...

## Who asked you?
I was just...

## What're you lookin' at? You lookin' at him?
No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.

## Don't tell me \"No.\" I saw you lookin' at him. Why, you like him?
I'm not interested in him.

## You're not interested in him?
No, I'm not.

## In other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right?
Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.

## You asleep?
Yeah.

## What did I say?
That he's got a pretty face.

## You sure you're not thinking of him right now?
Positive.

## What did I do?
You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do.

## What's the matter with you?
I went out.

## Where you been all day?
I took the kids to my sister's.

## What'd you see?
I went to the movies.

## Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
I am answering...

## With Salvy, eh?
I went with Sandy and Vera. Salvy was there. Stop it. I just had a drink, that's all. I didn't do anything wrong.

## Come out of there! Did you fuck Salvy? Answer me. Open this fuckin' door, you fuckin' cunt! Who've you been fuckin'?
Yeah, I sucked his cock.

## What?
I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.

## Why don't you just call him up?
No, not that.

## Then what?
I don't know.

## Why don't you just call him?
I dunno.

## Sure, what else is new?
No. This time it's true. I didn't bother to tell you until I had everything worked out.

## Are you drunk?
No. Open the door.

## What are you doing?
I need ten thousand dollars. My lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around, we can get the case dropped.

## Hi, Tommy. How are you?
Never felt better.

## Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
He should.

## How's the weight? Ok?
Yeah, the weight's Ok.

## He ain't doin' the right thing. He's makin' beans compared to what he should be makin'. Can't you make him understand that?
Hey, leave the kids alone.

## Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?
Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister in-law.

## Hey Joey, whadda ya lookin' to die young?
I'll suck your eyes out! I'll fuckin' take the two of you.

## What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?
No, you're his wife.

## I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
It don't look right.

## This is L. B. Jefferies, a friend of Tom's. Who am I talking with?
This is the baby sitter.

## Oh. When are they expected home?
I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.

## Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies?
He has it. Thank you.

## Jefferies?
Name me a better photographer.

## Like disposing of their wives?
Get that idea out of your mind. It will only lead you in the wrong direction.

## Didn't you take it to the crime lab?
I would say that is looked as if she wasn't coming back.

## You didn't see the killing, or the body? How do you know there was a murder?
I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely.

## You think I made all this up?
I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation.

## For instance?
His wife took a trip.

## By the way what happened to your leg?
-- until yesterday morning.

## What time?
Six ayem.

## Feel a little foolish?
Not yet.

## Now how could anybody guess that? They had, perhaps, signs on their luggage, \"Grand Central Or Bust!\"?
The superintendent met Thorwald coming back. He said Thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country.

## Doyle -- are you interested in solving a case, or making me look foolish?
If possible -- both.

## A detective's nightmare.
What's the matter? Does he have a courtesy card from the police department?

## Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is?
Mrs. Thorwald.

## You think he's getting out of here?
Everything he owns is laid out on the bedroom, ready for packing.

## Jewelry?
He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.

## Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested.
You sure it belongs to his wife?

## Your Lisa?
My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.

## Like what?
Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring. If that woman were still alive, she'd be wearing it.

## Where'd they take Lisa?
Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money.

## For what?
For getting rid of that cast.

## Who said I was getting rid of it?
This is Wednesday.

## Wrong day?
Wrong week. Next Wednesday I emerge from this plaster cocoon.

## Where?
Indo-China. Got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning. The place is about to go up in smoke.

## Didn't I tell you! Didn't I tell you it was the next place to watch?
You did.

## Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An hour?
With that cast on -- you don't.

## Like what?
I'll -- I'll get married. Then I'll never be able to go anywhere.

## Yeah. Is that you, Jeff?
It's me.

## Hello.
Something wrong?

## Who are you?
I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away.

## Why should I?
For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.

## Can you get me that ring back?
No.

## How?
Stella -- in economics, a kidney ailment has no relationship to the stock market. Absolutely none.

## It crashed, didn't it?
Right now I'd even welcome trouble.

## Gives your circulation something to fight. What kind of trouble?
Lisa Fremont.

## Behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause. What is it? You have a fight?
No.

## Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what I want.
Her father loading up the shotgun?

## Is what you want something you can discuss?
It's very simple. She belongs in that rarefied atmosphere of Park Avenue, expensive restaurants, and literary cocktail parties.

## You're never going to marry?
The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else.

## She pay you much?
The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.

## What'll you do if one of them catches you?
Depends one which one.

## Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?
Well, the salesman could be available soon.

## He and his wife splitting up?
It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.

## Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.

## What about this morning? Any developments?
No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.

## You called the police?
Oh. Well, yes and no. It wasn't an official call. He's just a friend. An old, ornery friend.

## Mrs. Thorwald?
Uh-uh. The dog. I think I know now why Thorwald killed it.

## You mean the one the dog was sniffing around?
And digging in. Look at that flower bed.

## There's a dip at this end. And since when do flowers grow shorter in two weeks?
There's something buried there.

## What?
Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.

## You can tell that from here?
I handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in New Jersey asleep for the winter.

## Would four of them -- ?
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.

## Got a shovel?
No.

## What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in?
Unless he's dumber than I think, he won't wait 'til his lease is up.

## What do you need money for?
To bail Lisa out of jail.

## How much do you think you'll need?
First offense burglary -- -- probably two-fifty. The piggy bank.

## What about the rest?
When those cops get a look at Miss Fremont -- they'll even contribute.

## Mrs. Doyle?
Yes.

## Jeff again. Has Tom come in yet?
Not yet, Jeff.

## You haven't even heard from him?
Not a word.

## It is something really important, Jeff?
I'm afraid it is, Tess.

## Who's Thorwald?
He knows. Don't worry, Tess. It's a man.

## How's your leg?
Mmmm -- hurts a little.

## And your stomach?
Empty as a football.

## And you love life?
Not too active.

## Anything else bothering you?
Uh-huh.

## The Lisa Fremont who never wears the same dress twice?
Only because it's expected of her.

## Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.
Tell me -- what was Slim Hayward wearing?

## How could I run it from say -- Pakistan?
Jeff -- isn't it time you came home? You could pick your assignment.

## You mean leave the magazine?
Yes.

## That's what I'm afraid of. Could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard?
I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.

## Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
Let's not talk any more nonsense, huh?

## Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?
Not exactly -- but we have a little apartment here that's probably about as popular as yours. You, of course, remember Miss Torso.

## You said it resembled my apartment, didn't you?
Oh... some songwriter. In the studio apartment. Lives alone. Probably had an unhappy marriage.

## Did you ever eat fish heads and rice?
Of course not.

## You might have to, if you went with me. Ever try to keep warm in a C-54, at fifteen thousand feet, at twenty below zero?
Oh, I do that all the time. Whenever I have a few minutes after lunch.

## Three.
Ever get shot at, run over, sandbagged at night because people got unfavorable publicity from your camera?

## If anything, I'm making it sound good. Let's face it, Lisa... you aren't made for that kind of a life. Few people are.
Well, they'd be very stylish in Finland -- just before you froze to death. Begin to get the idea?

## You don't think either one of us could ever change?
Right now, it doesn't seem so.

## Without any future?
I'm not exactly on the other side of the room.

## Don't you ever have any problems?
I have one now.

## Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.

## Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?
Homework. It's more interesting.

## What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?
Nothing, thank heaven.

## Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
I wouldn't dare answer that.

## What do you think?
A lot of things. She's an invalid who needs constant care -- and yet the husband nor anyone else has been in there all day.

## Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
She could be under sedatives, sleeping. He's in the room now.

## You could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up, and walked along the corridor, and the streets and the backyard?
Yeah.

## Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? That he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?
That's where he's being clever. Acting nonchalant.

## Don't you see how silly you're being?
The name on the second floor rear mailbox reads Mr. And Mrs. Lars, that's L-A-R-S, Lars Thorwald.

## What's the apartment house number?
125 West Ninth Street.

## Someone not his wife?
I never saw him ask her for advise before. But she volunteered plenty.

## I wonder where he's going now?
I don't know.

## Suppose he doesn't come back again?
He will. All his things are still piled on the bed.

## And you, and you friend Doyle -- Did you hear from him again -- since he left?
Not a word. He was going to check on the railroad station, and the trunk. He must be still on it.

## Something on your mind, Lisa?
It doesn't make sense to me.

## What doesn't?
Women aren't that unpredictable.

## A woman has a favorite handbag -- it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it. Then she takes a trip and leaves it behind. Why?
Because she didn't know she was going on a trip -- and where she was going she wouldn't need a handbag.

## Do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.

## Inside stuff?
Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.

## That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?
That's what the witnesses told him.

## We have all -- what?
A Mark Cross overnight case, anyway. Compact, but ample enough.

## I do?
Staying the night here, uninvited.

## You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
Exactly what I had in mind -- along with some brandy.

## Who was the trunk addressed to?
I'm not much on rear window ethics.

## Huh?
Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.

## Do you like it?
Well, -- if there was one less thread this way -- -- and two less that way -- -- I might give up bachelorhood.

## But you're not?
In the whole courtyard, only one person didn't come to the window.

## Is he cleaning house?
He's washing down the bathroom walls.

## Well?
It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.

## Wasn't that close?
Too close.

## And the last thing she'd leave behind would be her wedding ring! Do you ever leave yours at home?
Maybe I can get Thorwald out of the apartment.

## Shall we vote him in, Stella?
Get an ambulance. Don't move. Try to lie still.

## Think you've got enough for a search warrant now?
A man is assaulting a woman at one two five west ninth street. Second floor rear. Make it fast.

## Your name?
L. B. Jefferies.

## Phone number?
A new disease.

## Friend of yours?
I'm glad they let you out.

## Feel okay?
Give me some dirt.

## What's happening?
Good luck, Buzz.

## What?
You watch too much television.

## Chicken?
I thought only punks fought with knives.

## Machismo?
Somebody find him a knife.

## You satisfied or you want more?
How 'bout you? Say the word and you're cold, Jack--you're dead.

## Know the Millertown bluff?
Just him.

## What you say your name was?
Jim Stark.

## We heard firing. He get anybody? You alone?
We got a cookaboo inside. He wounded some kid earlier.

## How'd he get in?
Smashed the front door.

## Any other entrance?
Down in back.

## What time is it?
Hang loose. We got all night.

## You still want to go home, Moose?
No.

## It's just this get-up. The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper.
Not just buy! You hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough. We give you love and affection, don't we?

## I better clean this up before she sees it.
And you dropped it?

## You awake?
Yes.

## Listen--I took a steak out of the freezer. I thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party--just the two of us, what do you say?
I'm not hungry.

## What would you do, Dad?
I wouldn't do anything hasty. Let's get a little light on the subject.

## Just give me a direct answer! You going to stop me from going, Dad?
Ten years? Now, Dad--I need an answer now!

## I'm in terrible trouble.--You know that big high bluff near Miller- town Junction?
You don't want me to go.

## No! It's nothing! Just nothing! You always told me to tell the truth. You think you can just turn that off?
He depended on me.

## Sorry.
You don't?

## Excuse us a minute?
Sure. Sure.

## You sure?
I think I know my son.

## Can't you answer? What's the matter with you anyhow?
He's just loaded, honey.

## He's home. I heard the car.
What's that pounding?

## Look--just relax, will you?
See? It stopped.

## Who's there? Anyone there?
Open it.

## Is he there?
Yes, sir.

## Where's your mother tonight, Plato?
They not together, sir. We don't see him in a long time now.

## Well maybe she better start.
Do you hear from him, son?

## Do you know why you shot those puppies, John? Is that what they call you or do you have a nickname?
Plato.

## Where did you get the gun?
In my mother's drawer.

## Look--can't you see I'm writing?
I think his first name's Ray--I have to see him. It's very important.

## He's not here. He's not at Juvenile Hall. I don't know where he is. He's out on a call and he'll be out all night. How old are you?
My parents know I'm out. They know I'm here.

## Why don't you come back tomorrow, son? Ever been booked before?
Hi.

## You shouldn't monkey with him.
You remember me?

## What?
Plato. It's a nickname.

## You scared?
I just don't want trouble.

## I saw it. Gee, look at that thing swing, will you? Do you think it never stops?
No. In the morning.

## How'd you get here?
I hitched.

## My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
No. It's okay.

## I got to go in. You better get home too. Hey--what?
Why don't you come home with me? I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you? I don't have many--people I can talk to.

## Who has?
Everybody! Crunch and Goon and everybody! I think they're going to kill you.

## They think you told the police on them. They--who's in there?
No. I'm scared.

## Isn't it crazy?
Wowee ow wow! Let's take it for the summer.

## What?
Not lately.

## How do you know so much about this junk, Plato?
I had to go to a head-shrinker. I only went twice though. My mother said it cost too much, so she went to Hawaii instead.

## When was that?
When I was here? When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.

## Who?
Mom and Dad. I used to be in my crib and I'd listen to them fight.

## Plato?
I'm here.

## Boy, I'm blind as a bat! You got a match? I'm going to break my neck in here. Where are you?
I've got a gun.

## That's swell. How are you?
I'm fine.

## You think the end of the world will come at nighttime, Jim?
No. At dawn.

## I just have a feeling. Where are you?
Here.

## I'm not going to hurt you. PLATO Why did you run out on me?
We didn't run out. We were coming right back.

## Sure I'm sure. Judy's waiting. You ready to come out now?
No.

## My gun?
In your pocket. Give it to me.

## Who's that?
Just a guard.

## What's that got to do with it?
Well, it doesn't matter anyhow-- because we're moving.

## Do I have to spell it out?
Jimmy, you're very young--and a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life.

## Dad--answer her--aren't you going to stand up for me?
Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.

## Grandma?
Get lost.

## Too bad you didn't connect. You could have gone to Juvenile Hall. That's what you want, isn't it?
No.

## Sure it is. You want to bug us till we have to lock you up. Why?
I just get so-- Boy, sometimes the temperature goes way up. RAY Okay. Okay. Let it out.

## You feel like you want to blow your wheels right now?
Try the desk.

## Mess that kid up?
He called me chicken.

## And your folks didn't understand?
They never do.

## So then you moved?
They think I'll make friends if we move. Just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine.

## You got me, Jim--but they do. Want some water?
Hey! That's enough static out of you.

## Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
Cut it out now. I'm warning you.

## Who lives?
See, I'm new.

## University and 10th--Want to carry my books?
The kids take me.

## They'll be looking for you.
A what?

## They saw where I jumped! I didn't chicken! What do I have to do-- kill myself?
It doesn't matter to them.

## I tried to call you before. JUDY I thought so.
You were looking for me, weren't you?

## You still pretty upset?
I'm numb.

## You cold?
Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold.

## No? Why not? You know something? Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday. Isn't that dumb?
No.

## Why?
I'm getting that way, too.

## So have I. But I've never been in love. Isn't that awful?
Awful? No. It's just lonely. It's the loneliest time.

## Why did you do that?
I felt like it.

## Where you going?
I don't know, but we can't stay here.

## Listen! I know a place! PLATO showed me before. An old deserted mansion near the planetarium Would you go with me?
You decide, darling. Remember our budget.

## Ever been in a place like this before?
Not exactly. It's certainly huge.

## How many rooms do you think there are?
I don't know.

## Want to read any books? Take your pick! Isn't this the craziest?
Hi.

## What?
Your hand's all wet and it's shaky. You're so funny.

## Why?
I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato. That was nice.

## You disappointed?
Funny Jimmy. You're so clean and you--this is silly.

## What?
You smell like baby powder.

## I love somebody. All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody. And it's so easy. Why is it easy now?
It is for me too.

## After he tried to shoot you?
Yes. My best friend.

## What's he like?
Oh, I don't know. You have to get to know him. He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it. He's sincere.

## Oh, we can manage that! I'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...
Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?

## Yes. And so terribly annoying when they cry. I just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
It's all right.

## What?
He hates me.

## Is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning?
I was just talking a walk. I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them. I hate my life. I just hate it.

## You weren't looking for company, were you?
No.

## Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy? Do you enjoy that?
No. I don't even know why I do it.

## My mother?
She's being called for.

## How did you know that?
Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.

## What?
You're too old for that kind of stuff, kiddo. I thought you stopped doing that long ago.

## Girls don't love their father? Since when? Since I got to be sixteen?
Don't hurt him...

## Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
Please, Gabriel, don't...

## Gabriel! You said talk to him. That's all you ever said...
IS THIS NICK MASON!!?

## We're talking, aren't we?
That's a book, baby. That's a book of love.

## What, he should see me help you catch him?
He'll be dead when he does.

## Toys for... adults?
Slinky's in aisle five, Twister's in aisle one, Moon Mud's in aisle four.

## Negative five?
Yeah.

## Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
Tell me something. This the first time you've ever done this?

## I told you, Nick. Remember?
Tell me again.

## Ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate?
Yeah, well you wrote me you were six- foot-four, baby. So don't talk to me about little white lies.

## You forget where I work?
We'll have more fun in Detroit.

## I thought we'd have a few more days.
But you knew why. Knew why, didn't ya.

## Nick! He wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! That's all he wants! I hate him, Nick... you know how...
For what? You to talk me into \"helping\"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings?

## So get him outta your life. Get out of Michigan. They got perfume counters in Chicago, don't they?
Not without you.

## He working for them on this one?
No. He wants to be working for himself someday.

## They've never done a robbery?
They're truck drivers.

## That guy knows you?
Yeah, uh. Mike. That's Mike.

## I saved you because I love you, Nick. Why'd you save me?
I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry...

## What?
You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns.

## Nick, what are you talking about?
We need to find a way to make me part of it.

## Part of... with them?
He wants to see your map.

## How are we gonna do this, Nick?
Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.

## Is there any way you could get into his truck?
No.

## Here's the Picasso. Is he in his room?
They all are. Football's on.

## We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
I saved your life.

## What are you talking about?
You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.

## Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?
J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.

## What's her middle name?
Samantha.

## What'd they call her in high school?
Bam Bam.

## What'd they call her in college?
What college.

## Where'd she drop her cherry?
Be more specific.

## What's her greatest fear?
Her brother.

## Five million?
Christmas... Eve...

## I said, who the hell made the map?
I did.

## Bring back some memories, Nick?
More than you know.

## Rather be back in the Mountain?
Might as well be.

## A cowboy. You're going to send me into an Indian casino disguised as a cowboy. Have you thought this entirely through?
Put it on.

## What kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?
You do.

## Do I get a country-western name?
You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral.

## Ten dollars? What do I do with ten dollars?
Don't tip.

## What'd you tell that casino manager?
Nnn... nothing...

## You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
Nothing... I promise-nothing...

## He thought I was some gambler... he didn't know me... he didn't recognize me!
MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?

## It's time for me... to be working for me. I want mine, Nick. And I need you. Did you tell your manager there's gonna be a robbery?
No, Gabriel... no...

## What's the code?
We got five. Putting Ashley outside.

## What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
Not cowboys, Nick. Not cowboys.

## How'd you know my name...
Can't be attracting attention, right?

## Ash?
How'd you know my name was Rudy.

## Ash?
How'd you know my name.

## How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
Leave the tree.

## Where the HELL did he go?
We understand you, Mr. Bangs.

## Capades? They don't do it. Mittens? Outlawed. Why?
We're aware of your position.

## What?
Cancer-sucker.

## Fuckin' freezing.
His lips went next. You ever see some silicon-fucking-lips?

## Hell yeah. You work here long?
Five years. Since it opened.

## Hi, Nick.
How long ago was your makeover?

## Having romance problems, Romeo?
Not with you.

## How do we take them out?
You gotta get someone upstairs.

## What about the money?
Haven't thought about it.

## What?
Get a hot mug of chocolate. First thing I'm gonna do.

## And a slice of pecan pie, right?
And some pecan pie.

## Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?
Shoulda written, Rudy...

## What, working security?
No, I'm through with that shit. Ashley's right. Gotta start doing something I got a stake in. Get a business going.

## Do what?
Map is kinda dirty, Monster...

## Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.
Now where were we?

## I asked you a question. Are you clear about that?
Yes.

## How ya doin', Toothpick?
Fine, now.

## That I should've picked you up?
You fuckin' wish.

## You're coming back to work for us, right?
I don't wanna lift crates.

## A snake charmer, what the fuck d'you think. I'll call a doctor, take care of him, fix 'm right up. No, where's Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue?
Let me tell you guys a story. In one of daddy's clubs there was this black cocktail waitress named Elois.

## Elois?
Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called her Lady E.

## Where was she from, Compton?
No. She was from Ladora Heights.

## Was he all pissed off?
I don't buy it. It doesn't make sense.

## How do you know all this?
Guy got me on the ground, tried to fuck me.

## We can work this out, can't we?
This isn't all that bad. We can give you a lot of legitimate jobs. Put you on the rotation at Long Beach as a dock worker.

## And what are your answers? Was it me? You think I set you up?
I don't know, but somebody did.

## I take it this is the bastard you told me about. Why the hell are you beating on him?
Pam Grier.

## Say \"hello\" to a motherfucker who's inside. Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team?
This better not be some Freddy joke.

## ...What bar?
The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.

## Who, Mr. White?
Yeah.

## How can you tell?
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.

## Me and Mr. White?
Yeah.

## What about?
The Brewers.

## The Milwaukee Brewers?
Yeah. They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off 'em.

## What kinds questions did Cabot ask?
Where I was from, who I knew, how I knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit like that.

## Didja use the commode story?
Fuckin' A. I tell it real good, too.

## What's this?
It's a scene. Memorize it.

## But what is this?
It's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal.

## What?
Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job.

## I gotta memorize all this shit?
I can do that.

## What for?
Jesus Christ!

## Let's go over it. Where are you?
I stand outside and guard the door. I don't let anybody come in or go out.

## Mr. Brown?
Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.

## Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?
Crowd control. They handle customers and employees in the display area.

## Myself and Mr. Pink?
I'm sorry.

## How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin' good, ain't it?
It's a change.

## Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?
Sure.

## Who's your parole officer?
A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.

## How is he?
Fuckin' asshole, won't let me leave the halfway house.

## What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot.

## Wong?
Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale.

## Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong! You know, like the Chinese name?
Because you paid for the breakfast, I'm gonna tip. Normally I wouldn't.

## Why can't we pick out our own colors?
Yeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr. Pussy. Tell you what, let me be Mr. Purple. That sounds good to me, I'm Mr. Purple.

## Mr. Blue's dead?
Dead as Dillinger.

## I found this old address book in a jacket I ain't worn in a coon's age. Toby what? What the fuck was her last name?
Give me this fucking thing.

## What do you care?
When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.

## You gonna put it away?
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.

## Who gives a damn?
I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip. And when I come back, I want my book back.

## What's she doin' now?
She hooked up with Fed McGar, they've done a couple a jobs together. Good little thief. So, explain the telegram.

## Not a problem, got guys waitin' for it. But what happened to Marsellus Spivey? Didn't he always move your ice?
He's doin' twenty years in Susanville.

## How many employees?
No, they're not.

## What's the cut, poppa?
Juicy, junior, real juicy.

## What the fuck are you talking about?
That piece of shit. Workin' with the cops.

## That's your proof?
You don't need proof when you got instinct. I ignored it before, but not no more.

## Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. Wait a minute, who didn't throw in?
Mr. Pink.

## Mr. Pink? Why?
He don't tip.

## He don't tip? You don't tip? Why?
He don't believe in it.

## He don't believe in it? You don't believe in it?
Nope.

## Aren't you?
I don't have the slightest fuckin' idea what you're talkin' about.

## You do?
Your name's Freddy something.

## What the fuck are they waiting for? That motherfucker cut off my ear! He slashed my face! I'm deformed!
I do. How do I look?

## Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?
Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.

## What're you talkin' about?
That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.

## Follow you where?
Down to my car.

## Why?
It's a surprise.

## For what, the cops?
Nice Guy Eddie.

## You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why the fuck didn't you say that in the first place?
You didn't ask.

## Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
Stay put. Okay, fellas, take a look at the little surprise I brought you.

## That's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage?
I don't like alarms.

## Correct.
Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?

## You're not gonna fucking die, all right?
I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad.

## What happened?
Blonde went crazy. He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive.

## EDDIE Can you believe the songs they been playin'?
EDDIE C'mon, throw in a buck.

## EDDIE Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
I don't believe in it.

## EDDIE I don't even know a Jew who'd have the balls to say that. So let's get this straight. You never ever tip?
EDDIE I'd go over twelve percent for that.

## Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?
Dead.

## Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?
How the fuck do you think? The cops shot him.

## As opposed to good?
This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time.

## You really think we were set up?
I'm cool.

## That's not correct.
Want a smoke?

## What's wrong with it?
The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.

## Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine.
Look, enough of this \"Mr White\" shit -

## You're right, this is bad. How did you get out?
Shot my way out. Everybody was shooting, so I just blasted my way outta there.

## Tagged a couple of cops. Did you kill anybody?
A few cops.

## No real people?
Uh-uh, just cops.

## Did ya see what happened to anybody else?
Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down.

## What do you think?
What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.

## Nope.
Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?

## How can you be so sure?
I got the diamonds.

## Where? Are they out in the car?
That was the plan, we meet here.

## What?
Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.

## No shit?
Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it.

## I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon?
Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right.

## So, is he dead or what?
He ain't dead.

## So what is it?
I think he's just passed out.

## You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
I told him my first name, and where I'm from.

## And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
He asked.

## One question, Do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you're from?
Of course.

## Is that supposed to be funny?
You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.

## You takin' his side?
I told ya he'd be pissed.

## What are you gonna do about him?
He seems all right now, but he went crazy in the store.

## Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such a truism, how come every nigger I know treats his woman like a piece of shit?
Not these guys.

## We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
I've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed.

## And that's more important than finding Lednov?
Like you said, maybe he knows where my ranch is. If he does, he'll be waiting on the porch.

## Who shot who?
Nobody. The light was bad.

## I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?
All I can get out of her is she don't care about livin'.

## Too much excitement. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
This must have been in the family a long time.

## As far as -- Sonora?
Just about.

## What good is it going to do us to go to some ranch?
You can stay here if you like.

## Our kind of women?
You'll have to drive -- except down hill.

## Too much excitement. Or maybe it's just the heat. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
And this is Helen Carter.

## Thanks. And isn't there something we can do about supper -- or making the beds?
Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.

## But you eat, don't you?
Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.

## Where do you keep the can opener?
Of course it'll work. You can get another girl to fill out the act.

## If you were in his shoes would you take one of us home?
I'm not in his shoes, so leave me out of it.

## Would you, Mr. Phillips?
Go on, there's a good boy.

## Like what?
Like sticking his nose into other people's business.

## Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
They're stragglin'.

## Can we get a doctor at that ranch?
No, Ma'am, we can't. We can get a roof and a fire and maybe Mrs. Wyatt knows something about taking care of sick people.

## Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
Hold on.

## Coffee?
I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.

## The who?
You should know. She's in your dream.

## Will she be dark or fair?
Blonde as a new mop. And beautiful as the girl on a feed store calendar.

## Are we leaving?
It's too light yet.

## You're not going out to look for them?
No, I'm not. All I want 'em to do is keep ahead of us -- a long way ahead. So I'm riding up the line aways to pick us out a new trail.

## Don't you trust me?
Not on this trail, I don't. I've been over it before. Anyway, you ought to be pretty sleepy. Why don't you climb in back.

## Why do you think?
I don't know. I thought I did. Now I'm not sure. I thought it had something to do with me.

## You wouldn't do a thing like that, would you?
Yes. But -- that was the other night. Now -- I don't think I would.

## What did you expect? Speeches I don't mean?
I don't expect anything. A minute ago I hadn't cuite waked up.

## Where you going?
To the other side of the street.

## Why?
I haven't got the job yet.

## No they won't.
Which ranch?

## How does she draw?
A little hot.

## Who's Lednov?
A man I used to know.

## Like what?
Like why you're buyin' a whole slew of 30 30 shells all of a sudden.

## No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me. How's she feel?
Nice.

## But it's leaded up and anyway a 22's no good for real huntin'. You shoot a man with a 22 and where are you?
The thing to do is stick to rabbits.

## What was he in jail for?
You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.

## In a fight?
The other fellow wasn't even lookin'.

## You must be plenty worried about Lednov sneakin' up on us. Think he will?
Yes.

## At the ranch maybe?
Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.

## Do you have to be so close-mouthed? I'm your brother. And I'm ridin' with you. Remember?
All right. I'll tell you.

## He doesn't like me. What you eatin'?
Lednov.

## Where'd they go?
Swimming.

## How'd you happen to miss?
They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.

## Can I have my gun back?
Sure. You'll find it under the wagon seat. Like I said before, a twenty- two's more your size.

## Finished, son?
There's only two of them now.

## Want the wagon unloaded, Clay?
I don't care what she asked you.

## Sure. What other reason would there be?
I just wondered. Let's go.

## How's that?
Kind of sore.

## Guess maybe I'm old enough to hold my own in a fight, huh?
Yeah -- but don't make a habit of it.

## So -- maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life?
I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it.

## Yeah, how did you know?
The whole state's lookin' for 'em. And they're lookin' for me.

## What's there to be fair about?
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know you had a daughter.

## What's there to be fair about?
You can't stay here. There's snakes and it's cold and you'll just get sicker.

## What's botherin' you, anyway?
Runnin' off and worryin' people. Makin' it tougher on Clay than it is already.

## Me snoopin'? I came down here to take a bath.
Helen -- why don't you and Mary go on with Clay?

## That something I shouldn't see?
No. But it's mine and I didn't want anyone foolin' with it.

## What is it?
Just a thing I was workin' on.

## You wouldn't have a smoke on you, would you?
That sure smells good.

## You're sure there's more where this came from?
Plenty more. And somewhere up there's the lode, the rock rotten with it.

## What's the matter -- restless?
Yes, people make me restless.

## Even women?
There aren't any women here.

## Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people. Can I make it?
Depends on how good you drive.

## How long do you think we'll have to stay here?
Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.

## You're not giving up?
How many ways can a man say no.

## Clay Phillips.
How do you know who we are?

## Where is he?
Up the trail.

## How far up the trail?
I don't know -- I don't know.

## What for?
Because there's a man I want to see.

## Is that your kind of reading, Steve?
I can't read, Ma'am. I just look at the pictures.

## Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?
Since I can remember, Ma'am.

## Would you like to learn them?
I sure would.

## Did someone say I wasn't nice?
That's the end of the line.

## And that's tough, isn't it?
Without someone to teach you, it's tough.

## What do they look like?
Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.

## Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 'em in Nevada?
No.

## Would they be good to eat?
Then if they wasn't alive, how can they be an animal?...

## An' if you can't hunt 'em and even if you could they'd be tough, what's the use of knowin' how to spell them?
I feel good anyways.

## Now I know what a unicorn is, what do we do next?
Nobody's gonna catch him sleeping. Don't worry about him.

## And you've got me all figured out?
Sure.

## He'll treat his wife just as good. Maybe better. Ever see him use a bull snake on the mules like other wranglers?
Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.

## That's always tough. How long were you together?
No, I haven't dated in a while. My last boyfriend's...

## Alex, what are you doing?
Shut up, you slut. You think you can take him from me? Well, over my dead body.

## In room \"302\" at ten o'clock?
That's it.

## You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today. Hey, what class do we have next?
Psychology.

## Shhh... It's okay.
Cindy, what's going on?

## Ray, have you been here all this time?
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.

## You sure?
Yeah, I think I'll feel better sleeping in the arms of a strong man.

## Where's Shorty?
I don't know. He was right behind us. Wait here. I'll be right back.

## Then what kinda stuff can we do?
Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.

## Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?
Sure. We can practice talking.

## Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
It looks like the furnace.

## Well, if that's Hanson, then who's the guy with the hand?
Hugh Kane.

## That we should take our friendship a little further?
Yes...

## What about you, Buddy?
Well, I was hoping to get my balls licked.

## Can you feel that?
No. Try a little higher.

## Feel that?
No. Keep rubbing.

## Then what are we going to do?
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...

## Hey, wanna' share a soda?
Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.

## What should we get?
I don't care. You pick.

## Are you okay?
I think so.

## What, you think I did this to myself?
Good-night, Cin. I'll be next door if you need me.

## So, whatever happened to her?
She killed herself a week before he died.

## Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?
It's the sequel.

## How about these buns?
Yeah, they're so warm and soft.

## This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.

## What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
Right behind you.

## Where's Shorty?
I don't know. He was right behind me a minute ago.

## Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?
Yeah, I broke my fall.

## This can't be happening?
I don't need your help.

## What the hell are you doing?
Just wait, you'll see.

## What are we gonna do?
Me and my friends... You see there was this ghost. He came out of nowhere and....

## Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
Soon, but first I must bless this house.

## So, do you think you made it into the class?
I don't know, but I sure hope so.

## Nah, I need a place to stay. So how do you like being in college?
Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.

## Huh?
Gear. You know, clothing.

## Am I cool now?
Almost... Look, I gotta bounce. I'll holla at you later.

## Did you do that?
Uh, uh.

## Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
That turned out to be a good thing! It's gonna make smuggling a whole lot easier. Remember that weed? I'm about to get paid.

## Professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?
Yes, it was reported, but never substantiated.

## Professor, what's the history of this house?
I'm glad you asked. It actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story.

## Alright, Cindy, what's so important?
Professor, you guys gotta see this. Dwight, come here.

## Yippie! Wasn't that amazing?
It's some kind of energy field. We better record this.

## What are you getting at, Professor?
Good idea, and don't forget to give her a good-night kiss.

## Yeah, bitch, give me my apple. What's gotten into you?
I take it you're not mad at me.

## Who?
Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.

## Are these all the subjects?
Yes. The scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.

## Any of them hot?
I also took the liberty of putting those with near-death experiences on top.

## Willing? I like that. And, this one?
That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.

## Car accident, gun shot, multiple stabbings, a hook through the back... Where did you find these kids?
They are the survivors of the Steveston County massacre.

## How are we going to get them all up there?
I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.

## And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
In about fifteen minutes.

## Hey, you're the one who brought up safety. I'm perfectly willing to go in raw.
Right. What about condoms?

## Fine. What's all this stuff?
Well, this measures the amount of thermal imbalance within a room down to the tiniest molecular disturbances.

## Are those cameras all throughout the house?
Yes, I thought that it would be best.

## So, if one of our little chickadees is taking a shower which one of these buttons do I press to get a close- up?
That one.

## My God! Is she dead?
No, they're just powder burns, thank God. They were empty. Get her upstairs.

## What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
No, these are the tapes from the living room. Check this out.

## Are you sure it's not the tape?
Congratulations, Dwight, it's begun.

## What is it, Dwight?
I think we should consider cutting the experiment short.

## That's why we came here, remember?
Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug.

## What are you working on?
Just a little experiment.

## Work, work, work. Is that all that you do?
Well, there's a lot riding on this project.

## Ooh, you hair is so soft and silky. What do you use on it?
Just a little Rogaine.

## What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
Oh, I couldn't do that.

## I supposed you'd like a leg. How about two?
That's it. I'm gonna put my food in your ass. I should warn you, I'm a black belt in karate.

## My help?
A little bit... Give me your belt.

## How is she?
She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her.

## Would you like to see the girl?
Soon. First, I must bless this house.

## Yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there. Did you bring my bag?
Yes.

## Because she will lie?
No, because her breath smells like a horse's ass.

## What she said about your mother?
No thanks.

## Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.
Shorty, why don't you say grace?

## Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
What does it say?

## Yo' Tommy, what up, man?
Aww, man. You just need to chill out. Come on, there's this party tonight it's gonna be fun. Lot's of alcohol and honeys.

## What happened?
This is so cool! It's just like a horror movie.

## How about Mrs. Ackerman? We both hate her! Should she be the next victim?
Just a little, please. Bad for the teeth.

## Sure do. Did you bring back \"Ghost Dad\"?
Thanks, Mom.

## God, Mom! What's the matter?
Time to get up, that's all. You'll be late for work.

## Tell me the truth, Mom! It's ok with me, really! Are you a serial killer?
Chip, the only cereal I know about is Rice Krispies.

## Are you Chip Sutphin?
That's right.

## Detectives, what is this about?
Surely you don't think Beverly was involved!

## Dr. Sutphin is your wife a big reader?
Bird books mostly...

## Carl makes me happy and that threatens this family, doesn't it?
Doesn't threaten me, honey. I'm happy.

## Don't I get a kiss?
I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...

## It's fine with me, Beverly. You want to, honey? You think the kids are asleep?
We can be real quiet...

## What a mess.
Beverly, I've been reading all about it... is it menopause?

## Did you drive your car to the PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin?
I certainly did.

## Did you recognize the voice of the caller?
Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.

## Hello.
Who's voice was it, Dottie?

## Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
The police are tracing your call right this minute.

## Who is this?
No, I don't.

## You mean to tell me the day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's... the day you claim you recognized my voice... you weren't drinking?
One beer with lunch is hardly \"drinking\".

## So you do drink?
Socially... I'll have a beer.

## Marvin A. Pickles.
So you admit you just lied?

## Were you in the men's room at the Edmonson Drive In Flea Market on Saturday, September 19th?
Yes, I was.

## Mr. Pickle! Did you see anybody in the booth next to you?
I... I'm not sure... ...I... oohhh... Excuse me...

## Who wants fruit salad?
I do, please.

## That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
It's sugarless.

## And who may I ask is Carl?
Rosemary, honey. Good morning. I'm fine. Thanks for remembering.

## Just the damn cable TV company. You know how they are. Did you hear about Dottie Hinkle?
Yes, I did. It's terrifying! The police were at my house this morning.

## I'm not that bad a driver. Look at her hair! Turn it off, honey.
Who on earth would want to harass poor Dottie Hinkle?

## You want me to keep that under the table for you?
If you wouldn't mind... It was on sale.

## Mrs. Ackerman, when you left me at the flea-market, where did you go?
...Browsing.

## That was your People magazine with the letters cut out, wasn't it?
Yes, but I lent it...

## And those were your scissors found sticking out of Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?
Yes... but... I didn't...

## Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
No... I don't have room in my kitchen...

## There is one big problem though.
Mrs... Sutphin?

## What is it, Mr. Stubbins?
His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.

## Divorce? An alcoholic relative? Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.

## Are we leaving?
Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you.

## Nice one, huh? Winter's coming. Three dollars?... I guess that's what I marked it...
What's he know?

## You know who I am, August?
Sure I do.

## Mr. August, I'm not at all sure -
You can?

## Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles. You've got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?
Yes. She bought my sister's business.

## You think my sister is there?
You can't tell.

## Can we go there now?
Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.

## Which room is it?
It's the last door at the end of this hall.

## You scared?
Yes, I understand.

## Mr. Ward will see you in just a few minutes. Won't you wait, Dr. Judd?
Thank you.

## Are you Dr. Louis Judd?
Yes.

## I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.
You're not a dipsomaniac at your age?

## What sort of danger?
She could use a hundred dollars.

## How much have you got?
About forty-five dollars.

## Tell me, how is Jacqueline?
Oh, as beautiful as ever.

## Hello, Frances.
What circumstances?

## How's Miss Jacqueline?
I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.

## You mean Miss Jacqueline's gone, and you don't know where she is?
I don't get this. Miss Jacqueline was always so fond of you -- she was always talking about you - had your picture in her office.

## Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?
Redi's all right.

## What does she do with herself after business hours?
It always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy.

## Do you know what this is, Frances?
I ought to know.

## What did she want?
I did her hair.

## What were you talking about?
Nothing.

## And that was all?
No. She asked about the trademark.

## What did she want to know?
She showed me a drawing.

## Then you know where Jacqueline is?
But I'd give a great deal to know.

## Why?
I love your sister, Mary. I love her very much.

## Weren't you afraid?
The important thing is, the police won't believe you.

## A job?
I'd like that.

## The people at the restaurant?
Yes.

## Well, I'm glad you came to see me.
What brought you down here, Greg?

## What have you done about Irving August?
Please - I can't explain things like this to your right ear.

## Who the devil is he?
A poet. He's sitting right over there. That's his table  the one at the feet of Dante.

## What things? Why?
She's got to be found. That's the first step. She's got to be found so that she can give herself up to the police.

## No. Stay that way. I want to talk to you. I love you - you know that?
Yes.

## All very nice but, what are you going to do - listen at every house in New York for Jacqueline's voice?
I'm looking for a party -- a merry party.

## Do you think he knows about this?
I don't know.

## Could you find him?
I suppose so. I can pick him up somewhere.

## What's that?
Verse -- verse that I wrote. I need it.

## Let her know what?
That you love Mary.

## Who are you?
I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.

## Why wait?
I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.

## And then?
I don't know.

## You'll be all right?
Yes.

## And you knew he'd be here.
Were you going to make a suggestion?

## Yes. And now that I've shown you that I know that much, and can guess more -- will you trust me to look for Jacqueline?
I want you to look for Jacqueline.

## You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.

## And you believe that?
I have to. It was Irving August -- everything Mrs. Redi said - it fits in with what I saw - she even knew I'd seen his body on the subway.

## What's wrong, Mary?
Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.

## What are you thinking of, Bella? Can I eat dry?
Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the wine.

## Oh, Mr. Jason. I really shouldn't be doing this, you know. It's against the rules. When did you say you wanted them?
I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.

## And the other was Judd?
Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.

## Would it be asking too much, Miss Gottschalk, for you to get me these books?
What a peculiar question.

## I saw you with her last week. I knew you'd be here tonight. Where is she?
My dear fellow, it's neither your business to ask, nor mine to tell.

## But why come to me?
She was my patient.

## What was she to you?
I don't think that you would understand if I told you.

## Following me to find Jacqueline?
Uhhuh.

## And this poetry  like the poetry you wrote before extols the passion and beauty of life?
It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.

## Why not let your publisher judge that?
Wait - there is that other favor.

## You don't expect me to do that do you?
Yes. When I tell you.

## Tell me what?
You'll have good enough sense to tell us where she is - when you know she's a murderess. She killed a man.

## No other reason  no woman not the little Miss Gibson?
Perhaps.

## I don't suppose you'll ever tell her, will you?
She is very young -- I have an old habit of failure. It would be a bad habit to bring to a marriage.

## A book of successful verse might have changed that, eh?
It might have.

## What?
They may have found her. Mrs. Cortez - this morning I told her Jacqueline was no longer under my care.

## Dr. Judd?
Yes, Miss Gibson. I've come to take you to your sister.

## You know where she is?
If I didn't know where she was, could I take you to her? Get your hat and coat. We haven't much time.

## Cloven hoof?
Yes. You know the devil and all his minions are marked that way.

## Would they hurt her?
I don't know.

## I always thought it was a more intimate relationship.
Because you are intelligent -- that's why they sent me to you --

## Perhaps, Natalie, this is a bargain you're offering me --I am being allowed to join -- to buy safety by betraying Jacqueline -- is that it?
I haven't said anything of the sort.

## But you would like to know where she is?
Yes. There are certain punitive measures...

## Unless what?
It would be a charming experience. She might only protest half as much.

## Is it about Jacqueline?
No. She's no longer under my care.

## You're even sentimental about it. What made you change your mind?
This is incredible I It must be some sort of a joke.

## I'm afraid not.
No, she's with her sister,

## There's nothing you can think of -- old letters, anything, that might give me some hint as to where I might find Jacqueline?
Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.

## She's not been here for a long time.
Why?

## You mean she just came here, rented the room, locked it, and left?
Yes -- and pays the rent every month.

## Your sister - - have you heard from her lately?
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.

## Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
We don't know, Mary. We've been unable to get in touch with your sister.

## Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
Of course.

## Yes?
I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.

## What did he say?
Miss Gibson, I'm tired of resting.

## Is it fifteen minutes yet?
No, Nancy. You've got to sleep two more minutes.

## What?
I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.

## It won't hurt.
When?

## Yes?
Graham Dalton.

## Do you have other things?
Yes. Oh, you mean to bring in! No. Yes, I have some other things, no, I don't need to bring them in. This is all I need to stay here.

## Television?
Yes.

## No. Why?
Curious.

## Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
No, I think you look... fine.

## You play an instrument?
Oh, I like it. I like it very much.

## How long has it been since you've seen John?
Nine years.

## Nine years?
Yes. I was surprised that he accepted when I asked if I could stay here until I found a place.

## Why? Didn't you know him well?
I knew him very well. We were extremely close until I dropped out.

## Why'd you drop out?
Oh, lots of reasons, most of them boring. But, up until I dropped out, John and I were... very much alike.

## Sister older or younger?
Younger.

## Who's Elizabeth?
Do I pay taxes? Of course I pay taxes, only a liar doesn't pay taxes, I'm not a liar. A liar is the second lowest form of human being.

## What's the first?
Lawyers.

## Would you mind?
No.

## How do you mean?
I feel like they do.

## Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
Yes! Yes! I think that's very true. Very.

## Do you want them?
Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.

## Why is that?
I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking.

## Do you want me to?
As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you.

## You're what?
Impotent.

## Well... are you self-conscious about it?
I am self-conscious, but not in the same way that you are. You have got to be the most attractive self- conscious person I've ever seen.

## So you don't believe in therapy?
Well, my therapist knows me intimately.

## You had sex with you therapist?
Of course not.

## Excuse me for asking, but how would you know?
Well, I wasn't always impotent.

## Now, you said never take advice from someone that you don't know intimately, right?
Basically, yes.

## Ann. Hello.
That's correct. Bit of a dilemma, isn't it?

## Are you in the middle of something?
Nothing I can't finish later.

## What are these?
Videotapes.

## I can see that. What are they?
It's a personal project I'm working on.

## What kind of personal project?
Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.

## Donna?
Donna. On this tape it says \"Donna\".

## You went out with her?
Not really.

## All of these are interviews?
Yes.

## Can we look at one?
No.

## Why not?
Because I promised each subject that no one would look at the tape except me.

## What... what are these interviews about?
The... interviews are about sex, Ann.

## About sex?
Yes.

## What about sex?
Everything about sex.

## You just ask them questions?
Yes.

## And they just answer them?
Mostly. Sometimes they do things.

## To you?
No, not to me, for me, for the camera.

## I don't... why... why do you do this?
I'm sorry this came up.

## You know?
Yes.

## How did you know?
She said it on her tape.

## Why didn't you tell me?
Ann, when would I have told you? We were not speaking, if you recall.

## Why not?
It's not my place to tell you these things, Ann. You have to find out by yourself or from John directly. You have to trust me on this.

## Don't you want to make one?
Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.

## What would you know about a normal frame of mind?
That's a good question.

## What do you have to do to get ready?
Load a new tape, turn the camera on.

## It won't. Are you ready?
Yes.

## When we're making love?
Yes.

## Does he go down on you?
You don't know what I'm thinking.

## Is he going to see this?
Absolutely not.

## Did you have sex before you were married?
Yes.

## At some level, I don't understand your nervousness. Have you decided to leave John?
Yes, I have. I will.

## Do you want me to stop?
No.

## I know. Deep down, I know that. It just bothers me, when I have feelings or impulses that she has.
Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?

## So you do fantasize?
Yes.

## About who?
I fantasized about you.

## About me?
Yes.

## Have you fantasized about me?
I thought I made that clear before, when I said I would go down on you.

## I remember. You could do that, couldn't you? Go down on me?
Yes.

## If I asked you to, would you? Not on tape, I mean?
No.

## On tape?
No.

## Why not?
If I can't do it all, I don't want to do anything. And I can't do it all.

## Can't or won't?
Can't.

## Who was the last person you had sex with?
Her name was Elizabeth.

## So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.

## What was the problem?
The problem was me. I was... I was a pathological liar. Or am, I should say. Lying is like alcoholism, one is always \"recovering\".

## So you lied to her?
Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.

## And now you can?
Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.

## Don't you get lonely?
I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.

## Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.

## If you do get out of your marriage, will you continue to be inhibited?
I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no...

## And you feel the same way with John?
I'm not planning on it.

## If you were in love with me, would you?
I'm not in love with you.

## But if you were?
I... I can't answer that precisely.

## I'm asking for real. I want you to turn that camera off and make love with me. Will you?
I can't.

## Why not?
I've told you.

## Who? Elizabeth?
Yes.

## You mean you're still in contact with her?
No.

## But you're planning to be?
I don't know. Possibly.

## Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on here? Did you come back here just to see her again?
Not entirely.

## But that was part of it?
Yes.

## Like maybe a big part?
Possibly.

## Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?
I don't know.

## Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.

## Oh, you just moved here to think about it, right?
Don't do that.

## Why not?
Because.

## I want to know why you are the way you are!
Well, what kind of answer are you looking for, Ann? What is it exactly that you want to know?

## But why can't you just put it all behind you? Can't you just forget it? All that stuff you did?
I want to touch you.

## You did that?
Oh, we get along okay. She's just very... she's an extrovert. I think she's loud. She probably wouldn't agree. Definitely wouldn't agree.

## John?
Mmmmm...

## I called you Tuesday at 3,30 and they said you weren't in. Do you remember where you were?
Tuesday. I had a late lunch.

## Did you see a message to call me when you got back in?
Yes. I just got busy.

## Who'd you have lunch with?
I ate by myself.

## Well, are you?
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.

## My sister, for one. Is that who it is?
For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one.

## Is that supposed to comfort me?
Always the lawyer.

## Isn't therapy helping at all?
I don't know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.

## What?
I want out of this marriage.

## Why?
We'll call it uncontested or whatever. I just want out.

## Where did you go when you left here?
I drove around. Then I went to talk with Graham.

## Yes.
Answer me, godammit!! Did you make one of those tapes?

## Yes, I remember. What do you do when these moods overtake you?
No, I didn't.

## What upsets you about that?
I guess I'm upset because I can't really justify being upset, I mean, it's his house, really, he pays the mortgage.

## This unexpected visit notwithstanding, how are things with John?
Fine, I guess. Except right now I'm going through this where I don't want him to touch me.

## When did you begin having this feeling?
About a week ago. I don't know what brought it on, I just started feeling like I didn't want him to touch me.

## Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
Perhaps he senses your hesitance at being touched.

## Did you masturbate?
God, no.

## I take it you've never masturbated?
No, I haven't.

## What visitor?
The friend of John's that was staying at your house.

## Is he still at your house?
No, he left last week.

## What brought this on?
I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.

## I thought that's what I did. Who was it that you talked to?
That guy Graham I told you about. He said taking advice from someone you don't know intimately was... well, he said a lot of stuff.

## You understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time?
Yes.

## That you are under no obligation to me?
Yes.

## Do you want to leave therapy?
Not really.

## Do you feel there is more progress to be made?
Yes.

## But you don't have hidden motives for feeling that way, right?
I hate my sister.

## Why?
There are many things that can exert control over one's life, good and bad. Religion, greed, philanthropy, drugs.

## Must be nice. So, what's he like, is he like John?
No, not at all. Actually, I don't think John likes him much anymore. He said he thought Graham had gotten strange.

## Why?
I just want to know what he looks like, is all.

## Why, so you can go after him?
Jesus, Ann, get a life. I just asked what he looked like.

## What?
You know what. You say it just to irritate me.

## \"My type\"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what \"my type\" is?
I have a pretty good idea.

## What are you talking about?
He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.

## And what?
And... do whatever it is you do.

## Lose something?
That goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune.

## Are you getting Mom something for her birthday?
I don't know, I'll get her a card or something.

## Okay, Ann, okay. How about this, you buy her something nice, and I'll pay for half. All right?
Fine.

## What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
No, I didn't.

## Why not?
Because I never got around to it.

## Well, why?
Because. Cynthia, look, John was right. Graham is strange. Very strange. You don't want to get involved with him.

## Then what's the story, what's this \"strange\" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what?
No, it's nothing like that.

## Well, what? Is he dangerous?
No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.

## Well, what, then?
I don't want to talk about it.

## Then why'd you call me?
I don't know.

## What kinds of questions?
Questions about sex.

## Well, like what did he ask, exactly?
Well, like, I don't want to tell you, exactly.

## Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?
Apparently.

## Did he ask you to take your clothes off?
Because I wanted to.

## But why did you want to?
I wanted him to see me.

## Did he touch you?
No, but I did.

## You touched him?
In front of him, Ann, yes.

## Why?
I mean, I couldn't do that in front of John, even.

## So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird?
No. I don't think they all did what I did.

## Ann, I don't understand why this freaks you out so much. You didn't do it, I did, and if it doesn't bother me, why should it bother you?
I don't want to discuss it.

## Then why do you keep asking about it?
Here it is.

## What is it?
It's a sun dress.

## So what's my share of the dress?
Thirty-two dollars.

## Do you have my work number?
No.

## Did you take your clothes off?
No, I touched me.

## Who are you?
I'm Cynthia Bishop.

## Do I know you?
I'm Ann Millaney's sister.

## You want me to leave?
I just want to know why you're here.

## And are you here to berate me for making her that way?
Nope.

## She didn't tell you why she was upset?
Nope.

## She didn't give you my address?
Nope.

## How did you find me?
I, uh, know a guy at the power company.

## What do you get?
Not exactly.

## Doing what?
Talking.

## About what?
Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences.

## What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?
Nothing.

## You just want to ask me questions?
I just want to ask you questions.

## And that's all?
That's all.

## Is this how you get off or something? Taping women talking about their sexual experiences?
Yes.

## Would anybody else see the tape?
Absolutely not. They are for my private use only.

## How do we start?
I turn on the camera. You start talking.

## And you ask questions, right?
Yes.

## How long will it take?
That depends on you. One woman only used three minutes. Another filled up three two hour tapes.

## Do I sit or stand?
Whichever you prefer.

## I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
Just a moment.

## My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?
Your first sexual experience.

## Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?
No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.

## How unfortunate. So when did you finally get to see a penis?
When I was fourteen.

## Live, or in a photograph or film of some sort?
Very much live.

## What did you think? Did it look like you expected?
Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.

## What did he say?
He said that my hand felt good.

## Then what happened?
Then I started moving my hand, and then he stopped talking.

## Would you like me to take my pants off?
If you wish. You're not wearing any underwear.

## Do you like the way I look?
Yes.

## Do you think I'm pretty?
Yes.

## Prettier than Ann?
Different.

## Is that what he tells you?
He doesn't have to tell me.

## Look, I'm just going to come right out and tell you why I'm here, okay?
Okay.

## No? Not even one more?
I never do more than one. I'm sorry.

## I can't talk you into it?
No. You'll have to get somebody else.

## Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
I'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer.

## How about if you record over the one we already made? You could have the same date and not use another tape. Who would know?
I would.

## Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
Cynthia, I don't know.

## Meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right?
Right.

## Why?
I hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time.

## Who said I was jealous?
I did.

## Afraid of getting caught?
Maybe.

## You should be. Can I meet this friend of yours?
Cynthia, I don't think you want to, I mean, you should see the way he dresses. I really think he's in a bad way.

## You're intrigued?
Sure. Maybe he's the man I'm looking for. Then I won't have to fuck worried husbands all the time.

## Not today. I've got other plans.
John?

## How about inviting me over to dinner?
You know what I mean.

## When?
Right now.

## She's there? What's she doing there?
I don't know. I'm not sure I can duplicate the level of intensity I had the other day.

## Look, I'll call you, okay?
It's just so blatantly stupid, I have a hard time believing you did it.

## What's so stupid about it?
That you... you don't even know the guy.

## Well, you know him, he's a friend of yours, do you think he can be trusted?
Shit, after what you've told me, I don't know. I should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat.

## What if this tape gets into the wrong hands?
\"The wrong hands\"? We're not talking about military secrets, John. They're just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off.

## Jesus Christ. And he doesn't have sex with any of them? They just talk?
Right.

## You told Ann about this?
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.

## Why not?
It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.

## Exactly what I said. I'd trust him before I'd trust you. How much clearer can I be?
It hurts that you would say that to me.

## Look, are we going to do it or not?
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.

## Who?
Graham.

## I know. Will you please leave now?
Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.

## No. You said three-fifty?
Plus first and last month deposit.

## Will you lease month-to-month?
Not for three-fifty.

## How about for five hundred?
Everybody has a past.

## What do you think the Greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing?
A bonfire, probably.

## You were prying before?
Yes, this afternoon. I was grilling Ann about your marriage this afternoon.

## Really. How'd it go?
She held up very well.

## What do you mean?
Get rid of the car when you get your apartment, then you'll still have one key.

## You know which tapes! Where are they?
God, you need help.

## I'm not going to give you my keys.
My keys?

## Have you ever wanted to make love to someone other than your husband?
Goddamit...

## PHONE May I ask who's calling?
John Millaney.

## Mr. Millaney?
Yeah.

## Hi. Want a drink?
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.

## Was he nice to you?
Oh, you feel very good, Betts. You have such a cosy body. I'm jealous, I'm so skinny.

## Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
With some milk jugs I just happened to pick up on the way home.

## You're the one who found the bodies?
Yes.

## Did you touch anything? Move anything before we got here?
No, nothing.

## How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
He sounded fine.

## Is that the man who called you up here?
Yeah, that's Dr. St. Luc. He's the head of our little medical clinic here.

## Medical clinic?
Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.

## Kiss, kiss?
Uh, OK. Sure.

## C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more on the list?
No. Dotty's the last.

## Roger? If you're going to be staying here anyway, why don't you come up to my place for a late supper?
Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.

## Anything wrong?
No. I don't think so.

## Well? Supper at my place?
OK. But late.

## Where is he now? Do you know?
I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.

## But where are you going?
Down to the incinerator.

## What do you want to call me at the office for?
I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.

## You say something?
Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of my hands. That's all.

## Where is this thing that attacked your wife?
I hit it. I hit it with my cane. Then I carry it on the cane and I throw it down to the incinerator, down to the garbage.

## Yes? Who is there?
It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let me speak to the nurse, please.

## Want me to breathe deeply?
Just breathe normally.

## Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself.

## Didn't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor?
Didn't seem worried about them.

## Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?
That's the one.

## Gonna cut me open?
Well, let's wait for the X-rays.

## I'm still a VD man under the skin, Rog. You know me. I'm a down-to-earth kinda guy, right?
Well, at least you still talk the same.

## Did I say anything?
It's crazy.

## Right. It's crazy. But here's the beauty part. Ready? Who cares?
I don't get it.

## But you'll think about what I said about working together, huh?
OK. I'll think about it.

## It's me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me?
Rollo! How'sa boy? I was just thinking about you.

## He didn't make it.
OK, I bite. What does it look like?

## Huh?
I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.

## Yeah? What do I do then?
OK. It's apartment 1009, South Tower, Starliner Towers. May as well go there directly.

## Later, Brenda. Ah, Bert, could you spare a moment?
Of course.

## How's Brad?
A wreck.

## What's cookin', Bert?
I tell you what's cooking. She made the blind see and it was a gift! Who was it from? Let's hear an 'F\" for...

## About Brad's family?
As Janet's parents this should be really easy. Your last clue... Mental Instability. You have thirty seconds.

## Do you watch 'Dentonvale,' Janet?
I've caught it once or twice.

## Is it because I'm becoming too popular?
On the contrary. He wants to see your ratings soar. He needs a woman of exceptional desirability.

## Jah -- you endorse his product -- He endorses your research.
Can I just 'peep in' on Brad before I go home?

## How did you come by this scenario?
I am in Farley's employ -- and... ...we're discussing a network deal.

## Why Janet?
Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley.

## Of course, Mrs. Majors -- Janet -- But I'm puzzled. If she was so keen on getting him in here, why wouldn't she sign the contract?
No it wasn't Janet -- exactly -- It was, in fact, your new sponsor.

## Who trusts experts?
Out of self comes selflessness.

## I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.

## Conspiracy is right. The Denton Dossier is...
McKinley?...McKinley?

## Now Betty, don't overreact.
...closed?

## Overreact! You're the one with theories about conspirac... Oliver?
Yes, Betty.

## Are you spoken for this evening?
Clever of you to find this spot, Betty.

## In a little masquerade?
He was a President.

## Really. What'll I pin this on?
He was adopted you know.

## Well...maybe I could wear my black leather brogues?
Sure thing.

## We've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight. Is this true?
Absolutely correct.

## Could you tell us a little about it?
Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.

## Could I do that later?
Of course.

## Who?
Brad! Oh, Brad.

## What show?
Poor Brad.

## Why?
Your father doesn't like Mexicans.

## Janet! Where's that lovely dress I made you?
Oh, Mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser.

## Hey! What are you trying to do? Get yourself committed?
I'm sorry, Officer.

## Good! Well there's still hope. Lots of hope.
BUT WITHOUT YOU AND ME, SIS THE WORLD'D FALL TO PIECES VENA CAVA WHO'S THE RAVER?

## No...couldn't I do this later?
I'm...happy.

## Me?
It's classical. Almost a textbook case...

## Is it true they're all midgets with big heads?
Absolutely true. Compared to all of them, you are perfection, flawless beauty.

## Our field.
Do you really think so?

## What does he know about it?
It's you we're concerned about, Janet.

## Yes how are you, Janet? Are you happy?
No.

## Isn't she lovely?
Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.

## We all love Janet...Who do we love?
Nice technique there... ...Cammi.

## No, we're from San Diego. Why?
I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.

## Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean from \"One Life to Live\"?
You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.

## You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?
I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.

## And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
I liked it when you caught me fucking him.

## It's Christine. Hey you.
The fuck was that?

## You guys having fun?
Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have been a blast.

## I'm not going to call every five minutes, but this is important.
So what's up?

## Why are you being so defensive?
I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.

## Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
Bye.

## Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.

## And?
Huh.

## Are you there? Miles?
Yeah, I'm here.

## Lot of good stuff. Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
Absolutement. They have their own label that's just outstanding.

## What do you think?
Tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration. Nice fruit.

## You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
Highliner.

## Glass or bottle?
Bottle.

## You okay, Miles?
I'm good.

## A famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday. Don't I feel special?
Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven years ago.

## Oh, stop it. Make yourselves comfortable. You boys hungry?
Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious. Absolutely delicious.

## And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger?
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.

## I just remember you jogging. So when's the wedding?
Two years ago, buddy.

## She was good for you. And so beautiful and intelligent. You knew her, right?
Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.

## Hey, guys. How's it going?
Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.

## Now there's a girl who knows how to pour. What's your name?
Stephanie.

## Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie?
In Santa Ynez. And I agree with you about Cab Franc.

## You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?
Sure I know Maya. Real well.

## Good. How're you?
Great. You look great. You both do.

## What happened to you guys?
Couple of wrong turns. Thanks to Magellan, here.

## Are you a writer too?
No, I'm an actor.

## Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly.

## Maybe. Recognize this?
That's hilarious. You sound just like one of those guys.

## Why did you tell them my book was being published?
You said you had it all lined up.

## Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.

## Did you read the latest draft, by the way?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

## And?
I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.

## How about the new ending? Did you like that?
Oh yeah. Much better.

## Whoa, why are we getting off?
I've just got to make one quick stop. Won't take a second.

## What?
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.

## How old's she going to be?
Um... seventy... something.

## Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?
She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.

## You still seeing that shrink?
I went on Monday. But I spent most of the time helping him with his computer.

## Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?
And Lexapro, yes.

## So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu?
I told you. Filet and salmon.

## I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?
Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.

## This is rose, right?
Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.

## What color is it supposed to be?
Depends on the varietal. Just get a sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...

## I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?
Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, strawberry. I'm not so sure about the cheese.

## When do we get to drink it?
Now.

## Usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities, but this one's pretty damn good. This is the new one, right, Chris?
You know, you could work in a wine store.

## Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
Are you chewing gum?

## You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine?
Whoa.

## So you're going to stop acting?
Uh-huh.

## You know her?
Sure I know Maya.

## You know that chick?
She is very hot.

## Jesus, she's jammin'. And she likes you. What else do you know about her?
Well, she does know a lot about wine.

## Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.

## How do you know?
No rock. When she came to the bar, sans rock.

## Have you no shame?
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.

## So what's the plan today?
We head north, begin the grape tour up there, make our way south so the more we drink the closer we get to the motel.

## Nice, huh?
Beautiful.

## She what? When?
About a month ago. Six weeks.

## You drop this bombshell on me. Why didn't you tell me before?
No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.

## You've all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it?
You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he didn't know Pinot Noir from film noir.

## Do you know how often these pourers get hit on?
Get the trunk.

## What?
She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.

## With Maya?
Been divorced for a year now, bud.

## You know how often these pourers get hit on? I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come?
Nah. I want to watch this.

## So what should I wear?
I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer.

## Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?
Bathroom.

## What'd Christine say?
Lucked out -- got voice mail. Everything's cool.

## Where is Stephanie?
Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.

## What?
With this chick.

## Besides what?
Well... I don't know, just... the wedding.

## What?
Well, I've been doing some thinking.

## Oh, you've been thinking. And?
I may have to put the wedding on hold is all.

## Understanding of what?
Like I might be in love with another woman.

## In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything?
Look who's talking. You've been there.

## And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
You're crazy. You've gone crazy.

## Listen, I'm going to make sure Steph and Siena get home safe, and then maybe we'll hook up with you later, okay?
Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a movie.

## Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday?
Nope.

## Can you give me some room here?
Oh yeah. Sure.

## What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
Nope.

## What do you think's going on?
Could be anything.

## Been checking your messages?
Obsessively.

## But you don't know yet, so your negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't you say?
Don't come over the top. Stay still.

## What is it?
I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.

## Is what the money thing?
With Maya.

## Is an abattoir like a... like a... what is that?
Slaughterhouse.

## You ever actually read any of this guy's books?
Huh.

## Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is yo' daddy?
Put me down, Jack.

## What?
It's private.

## Do you like them?
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.

## Are they too sporty?
How about this one? We didn't hit this one.

## You ever actually been in there, Miles?
I don't have to.

## What's up?
I can't take it anymore. I've got to call Evelyn.

## What's that supposed to mean?
You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.

## Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.

## Well?
I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again.

## What's it look like to you?
Looks like you were in a bad car accident.

## What's that?
I'm thinking it's time to settle down. One woman. One house. You know. It's time.

## What?
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.

## Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
Ran. Twisted my ankle too.

## What?
I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.

## She tell you she was married?
Yeah.

## So what the fuck were you thinking?
Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.

## So what's the plan?
The plan is... you go.

## Me?
My ankle. Just go explain the situation.

## Hrnrnrn?
That was quite a day yesterday.

## Want me to drive?
No, I'm okay.

## Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
You're so negative.

## Well. That about does it.
What's wrong?

## Why don't you come in?
Uh-uh. You're on your own.

## Yeah. Hey, why wasn't I injured?
You were wearing your belt.

## I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.

## Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya.

## You want to join us?
Sure.

## Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?
The Windmill.

## What are you drinking?
A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.

## Oh yeah? How is it?
Try it.

## On a Sauvignon Blanc?
I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.

## Are you all right?
Fine. Just slipped. This is my blood.

## So what gems do you have in your collection?
You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc that's just sitting there? Go get it. Right now. Hurry up...

## It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
I don't know. Special occasion. With the right person. It was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary.

## How long have you been into wine?
I started to get serious about seven years ago.

## What was the bottle that did it?
Eighty-eight Sassicaia.

## Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.

## Is she sleeping or...?
She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie.

## You got kids?
Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.

## Oh. You mean... today?
Um... yeah but it's more...

## So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.

## A paper?
Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.

## So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
Well...

## Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos. Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.

## Can I ask you a personal question?
Sure.

## Yeah? Like what?
Like what a fraud he was.

## Bathroom over there?
Yeah.

## You know how to get back to the Windmill, right?
Got it.

## Um... did you still want to read my novel?
Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.

## Great. What's the latest we can get there?
About two-thirty.

## Were you ever going to say anything?
Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth.

## Do you know what he's been saying to her?
He's an actor, so it can't be good.

## Hello?
Victoria.

## Hello?
Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.

## So how're you doing?
Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse.

## So what's happening with your book?
Universally rejected. Strike three.

## Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
Back to the drawing board, I guess. Or not. So... you're married. Congratulations. You look happy.

## You quit drinking?
I'm pregnant.

## How much skin and stem contact?
About four weeks.

## Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak?
About a year.

## French or American?
Both.

## Sir, what are you doing?
I told you I need a drink.

## So what do you think?
We were thinking. Why don't we go back to my place? I've got wine, some insane cheeses, music, whatever.

## Where's Jack?
He had to make a phone call.

## So what are you up to today, Miles?
Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.

## You golf?
Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once.

## Where?
A famous actor who's getting married next week.

## You talked to Wendy?
Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.

## Miles, when are you going to get married again?
I just got divorced. Phyllis.

## What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
It tastes old.

## What's the rule about getting up in the middle of the night?
Only for pee or poop.

## Why do you talk to mom when you're by yourself?
It makes me feel better.

## Does she ever answer back?
No.

## This one?
A hair.

## This one?
Morgan took a sip. It has his amoebas in it.

## Not English though. You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill?
I heard them Morgan.

## Who said I was going to die?
I'm scared.

## Does it hurt?
I don't feel much.

## You do?
I see.

## Clear for what?
I got the bat at home... On the wall.

## You got two minor league home run records don't you?
Five. The five longest.

## This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
Boy, why aren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting handfuls of T and A?

## Explain, act crazy?
Curse and stuff.

## Are you going to do this or what?
No I'm not.

## You want him coming in the house next time?
I cursed.

## Bo, can you turn down the volume until Officer Paski leaves?
That roof is over ten feet high.

## I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone. Is that understood?
It's noise.

## It's broken Morgan. It'll just keep doing this. Let's get out of the car okay?
It's probably picking up another baby monitor.

## Do you think it's a possibility?
Yes.

## Do you feel comforted?
Yes.

## What's furry, furry rabbit?
That's a game isn't it? Anyway... There's been some interesting developments.

## What time is it?
Eleven a.m. They're gone.

## Where are you going?
Ray Reddy's house.

## Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade?
Chicken Teriyaki.

## Should we turn off the lights?
They already know we're here.

## Should we make a run for it out the back?
They're right behind the door.

## What are you doing?
I can feel air.

## How many died?
They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates. But we held strong.

## How do they know it's over?
A mass evacuation by them started about eight o'clock this morning. It's eleven now. They're leaving. Beat.

## Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared, but who knows for sure?
He's not strong enough to fight off another attack.

## Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie?
Yes.

## Morgan?
It gets clearer, the higher you hold it.

## Who wrote this book?
Dad.

## What's two?
They win.

## What do you think about the idea that they don't like places near water, and we might be safe from them near a lake or something?
Sounds made up.

## Where are we going to sleep?
The family room.

## What about Isabelle?
We'll keep her in the garage, after dinner.

## I hope they're doing better than we are. We don't even have helmets.
Now we're talking. How about you Merrill?

## Did someone save me?
Yeah baby. I think someone did.

## What's that?
Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now.

## You said something was strange. What's strange?
The footprints.

## What about them?
There are none.

## What kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it?
Second thing this week I can't explain.

## What was the first thing?
Sounds like a virus.

## He definitely wasn't a midget.
You can't describe him at all? Don't you think that's find of odd?

## Okay. So he was tall?
I would say so.

## Is anything missing?
No.

## Is he okay?
Yes... That's the first thing Colleen asked too.

## Why not?
See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.

## Pinned? What does that mean?
The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.

## Is that him?
Yeah.

## Some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world. Nothing really bad is going to happen, is it Uncle Merrill?
Don't worry.

## Posse? What the hell you talking about?
You brought a posse to my best hideout and you want to know if I mind. Mister, I don't know any of those names and you're about to die.

## No money, eh?
The money's in my saddlebags over there, but I ain't stepping out to get it.

## Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?
You got me. This is a crazy town, Emmett. I think we ought to get out of here.

## That's why they got you in jail?
Yeah, I kissed a girl and this guy didn't like it and we had some words, so I decided to get out of there.

## ...And you had to kill him?
No, no, no! I winged him, and he dropped his gun.

## You're in here for winging a guy?
Well, no, not exactly. See then his friend opened up on me.

## What friend is that?
The one with the shotgun.

## Jake, I'm going to ask you once -- was it self-defense?
Honest to God, Emmett, he would've killed me.

## There's nobody coming?
Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here. This is no place to be sitting with women and kids.

## Did it seem short to you?
That's all over as far as I'm concerned, Emmett. I'm satisfied.

## Where were you?
Chicago. Working in the slaughter- houses.

## Someplace safe. How you feeling?
I'd be worse if you hadn't come along.

## Where's Jake?
McKendrick's men got him.

## Kate?
She was hurt... pretty bad. Emmett, they took the little boy with them.

## Have you thought at all about your plans?
Some. I've been talking to the Parkers. One thing I know I'm not doing -- I'm not going back.

## Goodbye?
Yeah, me and Jake will be heading out for California soon.

## Didn't Paden tell you that?
Maybe you thought you'd be back this way someday.

## Are you all right?
This is a brutal land.

## How's Mr. Parker doing?
Just like you'd think. But he's not going to run. We're sticking to our plan. Now we both need help.

## Weren't you going to come out to say good-bye?
I already did that.

## You're not Baxter?
My name is Emmett.

## Hobart, what are you people doing here?
This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.

## Offend anybody lately?
Not for five years.

## Jefferson City?
No, Leavenworth.

## I've never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue?
I had to get up anyway.

## Where's the pinto going?
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.

## Where's Turley?
South of here, past Chimayo.

## Going to Turley, was it?
Gotta meet a guy and head out for Silverado.

## What's Turley like?
It's a town...

## They got a saloon there?
I expect.

## Women?
I expect.

## Which way do you mean?
Shame about the kid. Seems a lively sort.

## Where you been?
Oh, I was just checking the, ah... ...you know, lookin' in.

## Yeah?
All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.

## Daddy?
I saw the light. I thought maybe Rae had come back to see me. But I never thought it'd be my boy. I never thought that.

## Where is Rae?
She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm... ...just like you.

## What happened?
They run me off. They burned me out. They made it so I couldn't do. Just like Georgia. If you won't sell, they take it anyway.

## Who?
The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.

## What about the law?
Whose law? The law here runs a man down -- just like these cattle.

## Why?
Because they don't like what I want.

## What's that?
I want to build something, make things grow. That takes hard work -- a lifetime of it. That's not why men come to a pretty woman.

## You mean you ain't coming with Emmett and me?
We didn't get that far.

## What now?
We wait.

## Where's your brother?
He'll be here.

## This a friend of yours?
He is now.

## Who is he?
Oh, a guy who got run out of town...

## What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
I don't want you getting anyone in my place.

## What are you talking about?
I'm done talking. Get out.

## There are three strangers in this room, traveller, and these gents you are accusing aren't them. Are these your friends?
I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.

## Is there a place in town that takes... my kind?
You misunderstand. I want you out of town. In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction.

## What's all this then?
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.

## Who's going to pay for all this, Sheriff?
Don't press your luck, Carter.

## So this is the guy you're going to hang?
Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.

## Who did it?
I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And when I am sure, they're going to pay.

## Why come to me?
Because you're my sister. There's nobody else. The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.

## What's stopping you?
They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.

## Why would they stop you?
Because I'm your sister.

## Shut up. You need help, don't you?
This is it, gents. My ma told me to head south past that rock.

## Why are they doing this, Mal?
Because they enjoy it.

## You don't know?
I got there just short of too late.

## Where's Emmett now?
He must be pretty good.

## What about his brother?
We'll handle that. He's careless.

## Did you hear his son is still around?
Hello, Cobb.

## Hello, Paden. How ya doing?
I see you're prospering without me.

## Where's the dog?
Appreciate the loan. I'm good for it.

## You got a place to stay?
I just got to town.

## What brings you into my saloon?
Luck, I guess.

## What is it you want from me?
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.

## So we understand each other?
Don't worry about me. If you're taking on Emmett, the last place I want to be is between you.

## What's she got to do with it?
Not a thing. She's just a mutual friend. But if you wind up on the wrong side of this, she's going to get hurt.

## I run the place. What can I get you?
Nifty.

## Stella... Are you the midnight star herself?
I am. I'm always there, but I only shine at night.

## You like a good saloon?
It's the only place I'm happy.

## You see that fellow over there in the gray coat?
That's Kelly, my so-called partner. He runs that side.

## So-called?
Yeah, aside from being a loud-mouthed, lying cheat, he's just the man I would have picked.

## Why'd you go into business with him?
I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.

## Who's the owner?
Here he comes right now.

## Is this a fair mix?
I'm saving lives here. The straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather.

## What's this?
That's the good stuff.

## Oh, yeah? How good?
You really are a gambler.

## Where's the dog now?
He left me.

## What do you mean?
Cobb's got something on you, and it must be pretty good.

## What makes you say that?
If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.

## How about you?
I don't want you to get hurt.

## A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
Oh, no. The fan club is real. But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros.

## Can you tell us why you were disposing of the body of a woman who didn't exist?
It wasn't her body. It was her body of work.

## My God, are you alright, Simone?
Exactly. You're a household name now. You're moving in entirely different worlds. That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.

## God, Viktor. Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
Difficult. I'm difficult.

## -- Do you know what these are, Elaine?
Hmm... Mike and Ike's.

## -- overseeing the most cherished movie project of my career, am walking around with a pocketful of cherry Mike & Ike's?
-- I have a feeling you're going to tell me.

## -- What's wrong with that?
The public decides who's on that list.

## So there's no problem -- I can have the rights, the negative too?
They're yours. But how are you going to finish it? Without a star there's no movie.

## Where is she?
Good to see you too, Elaine.

## Why isn't she with you?
Why? Because she would never show up at something like this. She's intensely private.

## Don't thank me. It was entirely Simone's decision. Do you have Simone's check?
Almost right.

## Why not?
As I say, she's... something of a recluse. That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.

## Out of the question. A circus like that?
Viktor, it's my studio.

## There aren't any. If the filmmakers are happy, Simone's happy. She considers herself an... \"instrument\".
No problem. Do you want to come in?

## Really? Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?
If it's on the page...

## Hair and make-up?
She'll do her own. Theater training.

## She was in the theater? When? Where?
I'll send you her resume.

## What about it?
There isn't one.

## Even the fall from the plane?
Even the fall from the plane.

## Which accounts for your percentage. When do I get to meet this dream?
Not today. She's learning her lines. You can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget.

## Elaine, talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex husband... what the hell happened to you?
Simone does not control my destiny.

## Thank you. What did you think, Lainey?
I got them to remove the reflection. The mirror's metaphor -- to show how her character's inwardly dead.

## That's genius, Viktor. Was that Simone's idea?
Who else? It's always Simone's idea.

## You really think so?
Thank you. I'll tell Simone you liked it.

## I'd love to tell her myself. When are you going to let me meet her?
Soon. Soon.

## She was there. She didn't by any chance happen to mention me?
She said you were very beautiful.

## -- Viktor, are you with her? Is she there?
No.

## No, of course not! Why? Would you care if we were?
Thank you.

## Do what?
Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.

## I do?
Yes, you do... Anyway, tonight was a good start.

## Excuse me? Start?
It's a crowded summer. We need every photo-opp, sound-byte and column inch we can get. Good night, Viktor.

## About now. Would you like a drink?
I suppose I could stay, just until she arrives.

## Is Simone back to earth yet?
Not quite.

## I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor. Is she really having your baby?
Impossible.

## This is crazy. Who am I fooling? I can't compete with Simone. What woman can?
I would rather have you than Simone. Believe me.

## Oh, Viktor. You say that now -- because we're here, alone, like this. But in the morning, you'd go back to her. What man wouldn't?
No, I will end my relationship with her -- totally.

## How can you bring that up at a time like this?
Thank you! I don't know how you did it but thank you.

## Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
Exactly. Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things.

## That sounds wonderful. How do you feel about all this, Lainey?
Don't look so glum, Viktor. It's not a death sentence.

## Hello, is this Elaine?
Yes -- oh my, God. Is that you, Simone?! I've been wanting to talk to you.

## Where are you?
Right beside you. I borrowed Viktor's car.

## Mom, do you miss Dad?
Thank Simone for the tickets.

## Because obviously she existed, right?
I know it as surely as you're sitting here, sweetheart. She was the most vital woman I ever met.

## Of course. What are you suggesting?
I mean really meet her -- in the flesh.

## Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
Well, I --

## Listen to what you're saying, mom. Is there any evidence she is?
You had no choice, Elaine. He's a liability.

## Why?
Obviously, this can't last. She's going to dump him. Viktor won't be able to take that. He's too sensitive. It'll destroy him.

## Elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about Viktor?
I have to talk to her.

## No, thank God for you, Mr. Taransky. How many men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman?
You understand you'll have to come back to my place to keep them off the, er... ... scent.

## ... so much like her?
Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.

## What?... What did you say?
Do what you do to Simone.

## What I do to Simone?
Yes, call me Simone.

## Simone?
Yes, yes, again, again. Do what you do to Simone. I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.

## Is that a problem?
Of course, the only problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract more.

## Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
Who are you really?

## How about the nudity?
Nudity has just never been an issue for me, Frank. For me, clothes are just an option.

## What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
I suppose the thing I like most about the movies I'm in is that they're not about special effects.

## And what may I ask brought this on?
Nicola Anders is the only actress who can play that role.

## How will you do our love scenes?
Body double.

## You can't.
Hal, what are you doing?

## -- No. No. A real wall. You ran right through it.
Why not?

## How did the wall get there?
I can't explain it to you now -- you'll see when it's all put together. Anyway, we got it a couple of takes ago. Let's move on.

## I'm fine, Hal. How are you?
Somebody said she was here.

## You want me to call Security?
-- We call them \"vactors\".

## What's that?
An eye -- for performance. You know the truth when you see it. I know. I've seen your movies. I love your movies.

## You do?
\"Straw God\" changed my life.

## You saw that?
Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day. I'll call you about his next week.

## 2 Harry! Harry! Can we have a minute? What brings you here tonight?
I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.

## 2 There's a rumor that you're more than just \"good friends\"?
We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.

## Don't feel too bad. Mom runs the place and they still walk all over her. You're better off out of it.
2 Do I hear the sound of... wedding bells?

## You look very grown up. What are you doing? You meeting your mom for dinner?
I'm going to finish the picture, sweetheart. It's important.

## Your mother couldn't make it?
She's at the premiere of \"A Cold Day In Hell\". But I think she send someone from Acquisitions.

## She still with Kent?
There was no other way.

## Well, I can't wait to meet Simone... what's her last name?
You know, I... don't know.

## Is she here tonight?
She can't watch herself.

## I saw her picture on the, er... internet. You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?
Only her brilliance. To be honest, with what you had to work with, I was expecting a train wreck. You really pulled it off.

## Why?
I know plenty of boys.

## Really? Who? Where do you meet them? In a chat room? How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak?
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.

## How?
I read.

## Exactly. Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
I'm sure you'd tell me if you thought it was important.

## So that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six?
Precisely.

## I do okay. How about you?
You know me -- married to my work.

## Dinner? Dinner's difficult. A phone call?
Too impersonal. They have to meet face-to-face.

## I'll see what I can do. You know, Lainey. I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone. Don't you like her?
I love her but that doesn't mean I need to meet her.

## Happy birthday, Lainey. Do you like it?
It's fantastic -- it's too much.

## Why not? I can get you something else. What do you want?
No, that was me.

## About you and mom?
Max Sayer -- National Echo.

## Don't you have a real story to write? Why aren't you in Latin America?
This is the story.

## She sounds like a prisoner, Taransky. Are you holding her hostage? Are you some kind of Svengali?
I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed. It gets cold out here at night.

## What is it exactly you want, Sayer?
I want to see her. Unless you show me Simone live and in person I show these pictures to the authorities.

## What now, Sayer?
Looks familiar, doesn't she? No one comes from nowhere, Taransky. You turn over enough rocks...

## Don't you?
This should take care of Mother.

## Is it a jamming device?
Maybe he's talking to himself.

## Why?
Whatever it is, it's dark.

## Dark?
Yes, very.

## 24-hour tail on Taransky?
Shutter bugs camped outside any place he goes, every concierge and maitre d' on the take. But this Simone woman is good.

## My God, you've got one?
I will when you're finished writing it.

## Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?
We used to.

## Is that why she left you?
It's a hotel.

## -- Nicola! How was your massage?
It's the biggest on earth! I swear! It's a 50-foot Airstream -- they don't make them any longer than that.

## Taller? What?
I beg you. You can't do this to me.

## Would you like me to read?
Yes, I'd like that.

## You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
No, of course not, you're right. That would be crazy.

## What if it catches on fire?
Let it burn. Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy.

## I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.

## Simone, are you there?
I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.

## VIKTOR You mean they buy it?
Buy it? They're paying for it. And around here that's how you really know they buy it.

## VIKTOR Is that better, Mr. Taransky?
Yes. Yes, it is.

## VIKTOR Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
The only real truth is in the work.

## Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss?
Wow. They called you their son.

## Why did you leave me?
I didn't leave you.

## All your soldiers speak Latin?
No, just one.

## What were they hiding from?
Oh, lots of things, I suppose. Bad people for one. People who wanted to imprison them. Hurt them.

## Nothing bad can happen in a church, right?
I forgot your name.

## You're a doctor. What kind?
I work with young people who might be sad or upset or just want to talk. I try to help them figure things out.

## You use needles?
No.

## Not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt?
No.

## If it's okay with you?
And Cole, next time I won't be late for you.

## You saw that on T.V., Cole?
Everybody got upset. They had a meeting. Momma started crying. I don't draw like that anymore.

## How do you draw now?
I draw people with smiles, dogs running, and rainbows. They don't have meetings about rainbows.

## You want to ask me a question?
See, this is why I lose at poker. Yes, I do have a question.

## Where should I look then, Cole?
Look over there.

## He your best buddy?
He hates me.

## You ever tell her about how it is with Tommy?
I don't tell her a thing.

## Why?
Cause she doesn't look at me like everybody and I don't want her to. I don't want her to know.

## Know what?
That I'm a freak.

## What about Mrs. Marschal?
She died a long time ago.

## What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
I don't know. I was just thinking the same thing.

## What'd you write?
Words.

## What kind of words?
Upset words.

## If we could change something in your life, anything at all, what would you like that to be?
That isn't magic.

## What?
You just kept the penny in that hand the whole time...

## Who me?
I didn't know you were funny.

## Your father ever tell you bedtime stories?
Yes.

## You haven't told bedtime stories before?
No.

## What makes you think that?
Your eyes told me.

## Dead people, like in graves and coffins?
No, walking around, like regular people... They can't see each other. Some of them don't know they're dead.

## All the time. They're everywhere. You won't tell anyone my secret, right?
...No.

## What?
I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk. I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats.

## Cats?
Never mind.

## And the tiny hairs on your arm. Are they all standing up?
When they get mad, it gets cold.

## Can I ask you then?
Yes.

## What do you want more than anything?
I don't know.

## Why don't you think about it for a while?
I have to.

## When?
Soon. One week.

## --What?
Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it.

## Dr. Crowe?
Yes.

## Something happened, didn't it?
Yes, it did.

## Are you wigging out?
Yes, I am.

## We're not gonna start crying again, are we?
No, we're not.

## What happened?
You really look better.

## It's Spanish. It means... 'I don't want to die.' Not all the ghosts are scary, are they? Like Mrs. Marschal?
No.

## You believe now?
I believe both of you now. And I think I might know how to make them go away.

## What if they don't want help? What if they're just angry and they want to hurt somebody?
I don't think that's the way it works, Cole.

## She came a long way to visit me, didn't she?
I guess she did.

## Don't go home, okay?
I definitely won't.

## I think we said everything we needed to say. Maybe it's time to say things to someone else? Someone close to you?
Maybe.

## What?
Tommy Tammisimo sucked big time.

## What are you thinking, Momma?
Lots of things.

## Anything bad about me?
It was Grandma's. It's not for playing. What if it broke? You know how sad I'd be.

## That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart?
Sometimes people think they lose things and they didn't really lose them. It just gets moved.

## You didn't take it before. You didn't take it the time after that. And now, you didn't take it again?
Don't get mad.

## So who moved it?
Maybe.

## Communicate?
Tell you my secrets.

## You know that accident up there?
Yeah.

## They did?
A lady. She died.

## You can see her?
Yes.

## Where is she?
Standing next to my window.

## They?
Dead people.

## Dead people?
Ghosts.

## You see ghosts, Cole?
They want me to do things for them.

## What are you thinking, Momma?
...I don't know.

## I would never think that about you... ever... Got it?
Got it.

## What?
Grandma comes to visit me sometimes.

## Yes, Cole?
They used to hang people here.

## That's not correct. Where'd you hear that?
They'd pull the people in crying and kissing their families bye... People watching would spit at them.

## You shouldn't laugh at people. It makes them feel bad.
Like what?

## How did you--?
Stop looking at me.

## Chuck E. who?
Cheese. It's a kid's place.

## J. C. Penny's?
Good for you.

## How'd he know I'd come?
Course, some folks say 'ol Jethro shouldn't have been buried up here... with the rest of the Macdonalds.

## Meaning?
Hell, he was your grandfather. You know what he did.

## What are you talking about?
Course, it's none of my business.

## You ever hear of... the harvest of blood?
Superstition.

## ...Chicken blood? Who said it was... \"chicken blood\"?
I'd watch your step if I were you, son.

## Oh yeah? Why's that?
You're standing in horseshit.

## Yo. \"Billy Bob\". Was I two beats behind, or what?
Nope.

## See?
You were a beat and a quarter behind.

## Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?
I ain't never played a banjo in my life.

## Get off his case sweetie.
Okay, Farm Boy. Joke's over. You've been playin' me from jump street. Where's my Nikes?

## Where'd you come from? Groupies R Us?
Fuck you.

## Someone actually... employs you?
I happen to be a professional.

## Which street corner?
Hi.

## ...You any good with those?
You have a strong unfufilled desire.

## Hey, isn't that the preacher?
Find out what's holding things up. I want to get the hell off this farm.

## You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
Not someone -- Mac.

## Carl, what are you doing?
You need someone who can protect you, Suzie.

## Hey. Fuck you.
You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?

## Where's Jack? Anybody seen Jack?
Okay. My main man. Marvin Gaye.

## Curt Cobain.
Two hundred bucks? Are you crazy?

## Shotgun. Suicide. Next?
Well, there goes our record deal.

## Let me get this straight... we're talking about manure?
The ancient Aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.

## Are you crazy?
Sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before I rolled it.

## So... what does it do?
It harvests! It threshes! Look at these blades.

## Should we be doing this, dude?
That old barn. After the fire... I rebuilt it nail by nail. Just the way your granddaddy would've wanted it.

## Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
I'll be fine here.

## Amends...?
Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.

## I'm admiring your costume. What \"movie\" are you going as again?
Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.

## Dammit, Karen -- I was just... looking for your pulse.
You don't like my costume? Cool. I'll go with plan B. Which one you like better?

## What's wrong?
Nothing. I'll have us back on the road in no time.

## Amen.
You got something against farm people, Keith?

## What the fuck you talking about, man?
You wanna know the difference? The difference is that you're screwing up the song.

## Is that right?
-- picked tonight to come by and watch our set.

## About what?
Name something.

## Then why go back now?
Still trying to figure it out myself.

## What about Jeremiah?
Nah. Just you.

## What's wrong?
This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic.

## So?
I... heard something... came in here last night. Must have gone to sleep.

## Picked up one of those shears. Blade's razor sharp. -- Where is everyone?
Getting ready.

## Look. You want to talk about this?
You're... limping.

## Like what?
Like your guitar break.

## -- Where have you two been?
Us? We been... moonlighting.

## Where's Mac?
Who knows? Just like a man... never around when you need them.

## Why bother?
It gets worse. He's cut all the phone lines.

## What'll we do?
Bill, you're Chief of police now.

## How are you going to find him?
Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.

## Sorry.
And that makes you look like a squid?

## Whatcha' doin'?
Tryin' to get a buzz on. But I'm too buff. Too much muscle mass.

## What you up to?
Just checking out the lights.

## Pretty, ain't they?
I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.

## Oh, yeah?
Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.

## Grant, where'd you go?
Hey, Grant.

## No. What?
She disappeared Friday night. We got reason to believe foul play might be involved.

## How about Brenda?
New? No. We're hoping we find Grant, he'll lead us to her.

## I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.

## Yeah. Good.
What?

## I'll get it for you. Ibuprofen or aspirin?
Aspirin.

## We'll just head up here into Bishopville, get checked up in the hospital. Then maybe we'll head off to Hollywood after all, huh?
Okay.

## What's she see in that douchebag?
He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.

## Think we should get up a search party, head in there?
And then we get here, the Castavets', where last night's shit--storm took place.

## Hey, Wally. Glad you're here. There was something I wanted to tell you...
I see. It's like as if he's going in a pattern. Is that what you're saying, Bill?

## What?
Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.

## You dig that rat out of the hole?
Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half--Mexican.

## Where's the old half--Mexican?
Took the kids to his Mom's for the weekend.

## What?
Grant? Grant, I'm hungry. I'm so fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna die.

## Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?
Sure thing, killer.

## What can I do you for?
Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.

## All the rib eyes?
Yep. And while you're at it, get me a few of them chicken wings... some pork loins... and, ooo, what's this here? Osso buco?...

## That's not true -- Where are you--?
Out.

## Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got so excited about... your present.

## You're my princess, aren't you?
Okay.

## What are you doing?
You're pretty.

## Who's that?
It's just one of my students, Grant.

## Grant. Oh my God. What happened to your -- ?
I'll get if for you.

## What other stuff?
Now he's here. He went in Mr. Grant.

## And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
When one sees you they all see you.

## Gold--digger, huh?
We ain't never gonna find that girl now.

## Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?
Yeah, it's the highlight of my day.

## If...?
I can't believe there's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks.

## America's bored. Now, what do you want?
You to forget this dumbass Roadeo and take on a real challenge.

## What do you think?
All sound reasons for matrimony.

## Why're you driving so fast?
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.

## Why? You have a bowling date?
Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.

## Who'd want to?
I never looked at it that way. You ask a lot of questions.

## Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.

## But you could get killed, right?
Hey, you could get killed crossing the street.

## A what?
Eyes on the road.

## No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
Having fun.

## Driving?
Driving, talking to me...

## Where you from?
Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement.

## Guess what?
I give up.

## What the hell's going on?
I forget to tell you. I'm running blocker for four hundred cases of illegal brew.

## Anything?
We're cool. The dumb schmuck took the wrong turn.

## Can I ask you something?
Shoot.

## What do you want to be when you grow up?
You know, you're not a bad driver.

## That's a Texas cop. What the hell's he doing in Arkansas?
I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.

## Well?
We lost him.

## The bus'll pick you up over there. Uh... you got enough bread for a ticket?
Enough to get to Jersey. I'll walk the rest of the way. I've been sitting a long time. Nice meeting you. It's been a trip.

## You know this guy, don't you?
I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out.

## By stealing my car?
I would've come back for you.

## You want to lose this putz or not?!?
Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.

## You plan on driving trucks all your life?
No, actually I was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon.

## You plan on driving trucks all your life?
I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.

## Then let's change the subject. What do you think about forced school busing?
An unmarked police car.

## How do you know?
I know. Bandit two, bring yourself on in.

## Yeah?
You only smoked three cigarettes through the entire state of Mississippi.

## Ummm?
Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.

## And?
He wasn't. One day I came home and found him taking a shower -- with another girl. And her sister.

## Bandit II?
-- It's hard to believe this schmuck Kyle would go to such lengths for Coors beer.

## What kind of a guy is he?
The minute you see him, you'll know.

## Why are you stopping?
Weight Station.

## One to five?
Maybe six months with good behavior. One to five.

## What can I say?
Promise me you won't fall in love with an inmate.

## I should've told you, but you would've thrown me out, right?
Absolutely.

## What are you thinking?
You gotta admire the man's determination.

## Why should I?
Because I need your help, sweet thing. And I need it bad.

## What do you want me to do, Hot Pants? Beg?
Yes.

## But you'll do it?
I'll do it.

## What's your pleasure?
Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments...

## No what?
Nothing on 'em and two cups of mud; one while I'm waiting.

## Sure I can't interest you in anything else?
Another time.

## How'd you know?
Twenty-eight hours! You're outta your gord.

## You know of course, we ain't ever gonna make it.
Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?

## Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
No.

## I don't know, man. Ask him?
We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.

## What are you doin' now?
Running blocker.

## Why are we doing this?
Because they said it couldn't be done.

## Let's get the hell outta here.
You know how to drive one of these things?

## Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
Right. Give me your pen. We'll tell 'em to bill Kyle.

## We still on schedule?
Forty-two minutes ahead.

## Bandit I, do you copy?
This is Bandit I, come back.

## On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.

## What's your twenty?
I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.

## What's a Texas Smokey doing in Arkansas, man?
If I knew, Cledus; I'd be on College Bowl.

## What does the old Timex say?
She's losing minutes so you better start running interference or we're never gonna make it. Might I remind you this was your brainstorm.

## Yeah, guy?
Pick up a burger for Fred. He's going crazy.

## What's your twenty?
Bout fourteen miles this side of Mississippi.

## Just don't worry about it. How we doin' timewise?
Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.

## Bandit?
Never mind. It's nothing.

## Anything else you don't want me to know?
Nope. Just keep those wheels churning.

## Now what?
We're outta motion lotion.

## Just fine. What's the weather like?
God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.

## -- How we doing?
It's gonna be close. Real close.

## Bandit II?
I'm here.

## What's that, pardner?
Don't take that foot off the hammer, 'cause you got wall-to-wall Bears about to pour over you like maple syrup.

## When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.

## What's your twenty and what's your handle?
My handle's Smokey Bear and I got you by the tail.

## What else? Can you give me cover, Mister B?
It ain't ever been done before, hot shit.

## Seventy-two five. Why do you want this barley pop so bad?
He's thirsty.

## Have any trouble getting here?
About one to five years worth.

## Uh-uh. What Cobra?
Some boy named Bandit's been givin' the Highway Patrol shit fits.

## Where the hell are you?
Smokey was on our tail. We had to take a detour to ditch the motherfu...

## Who's Fred?
Bandit II. We'll be back on the highway in a second. Over.

## Yeah, Bandit II, Que pasa?
That's a Texas bubble gum machine on your back porch.

## Bandit two, you read me?
You're soundin' real bodacious. Back.

## Is that Bandit in the lead?
If that sumbitch was in the race, he'd be in the winner's circle by now.

## Why don't we just rent a Lear jet and haul it back ourselves?
Because I wanna see this hot shot Bandit do something that can't be done. Besides, there's nothing I like better than breaking legends.

## But if it can't be done, how's he gonna do it?
That's the point, Dickey.

## -- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
-- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.

## -- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
-- Yeah, I heard. But they won't hold him for long. Anyway, he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money.

## So, Bill, if I understand this right, you currently have your penthouse floor under construction?
That's correct.

## -- so you shut them off?
Yes, but no -- we have personnel stationed at both ends of that hall, twenty-four hours a day.

## What kind of personnel?
Right now? A six man security force, plus a member of our Butler staff. So seven men total.

## Is your security team armed?
Of course. Yes.

## Anything on the Swede?
Only the mention made in that phone call. There's no Swedish hitman of any renown, much less one with a million dollar day rate.

## But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed Heller. Why not go after him, guns blazing' for that one?
Yeah, but the Untouchables took down Capone. Heller got shot and killed. The bad guys beat him. Worse, Sparazza walked.

## So he has no idea what's about to happen?
No. And I want to be in that room a half second after Mecklen calls to say the deal's done. We've got a sheriff's task force on stand-by.

## He's giving them up?
All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.

## Did the Justice lawyers sign off?
That's happening in about ten minutes. Israel's at optimum risk of flight right now, so we can't wait.

## Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security?
No. I'm going over there. You take the car from there, get out to the lake.

## -- he was wearing one of our jackets.
Wait a minute, what other agent? What other agent?

## This man wearing the jacket identified himself as an Federal agent?
Uh, yeah.

## You're sure?
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said \"FBI\" on it.

## You investigating those murders out at the lake?
Ww... uh...

## And this is your car, isn't it?
Mmm-hmm.

## But there were more of you?
Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.

## Two of 'em?
Thass' right. I got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad.

## You woulda?
Oh hell yeah. We's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. So don't feel so bad dude.

## Really?
I'm glad I'm here. I love it. I'm gonna get laid by some fine ass angels and then go hang out with Jesus and them.

## Are you on a land line?
Yeah, why.

## ...About what?
About cocaine... and the amount you're doing.

## What happened?
His law firm, same one that hired me. Israel walked out after he made bail and nobody's seen him since.

## -- Jack, what am I doing? I'm standing here, aren't I? Shouldn't that be enough? That I made the trip?
Your attitude sucks.

## I been accused of worse. What do we got...?
I got his machine.

## What'd you say?
I said I got his machine.

## No, what did you say on the machine?
I left him a message.

## Then why are you still looking at me like I'm asking for the square root of something! What did you say!?
I said that we were returning his call and you were real concerned, because he sounded real concerned.

## About what?
Look at the collar on that coat...

## I could have it sent out...
I dunno... Cinnamon roll?

## Do you want me to say I did it?
I was kinda hoping, yeah.

## Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
Only if you really, truly mean it.

## Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
I am. Yeah.

## Without peer?
I -- uh, yeah, I guess, yeah.

## They what? What? No. No. Why?
The Deputy Director, this prick Locke, he smashed the whole thing, we're done, they won't tell me why...

## So he's personally issued the contract on Israel?
Sparazza was the one who introduced Israel to the life, gave him his first big break, brought him through the ranks.

## So the wiretaps we conducted on Serna and Padiche, the mention of Israel's heart?
On an extradition flight back to El Salvador, he murdered a security detachment and vanished.

## You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
It's the last place they'd look.

## This is him? The hitman hired to kill Israel? He's a doctor?
Difficult to explain everything now... And much larger issues loom. I'm sorry about Carruthers... Damndest thing to have to die for.

## You're finished.
Where's Israel?

## ...Does he know?
...He does now...

## The same year that Sparazza murdered Agent Freeman Heller...
...When did you know all this?

## ...So you made another deal?
I wouldn't go that far.

## You're trying to save Sparazza?
No... We're trying to save Heller.

## No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now.
Buzzy... Buzz...?

## Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.

## ... Jesus... what for?
-- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.

## That's not a problem. Are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?
Yeah, I can front this.

## That's the punchline, y'ready?
Shoot.

## So how we lookin'?
Good. This thing's on track, looks like it's gonna get done.

## Cold blood Sid, dead eyes, y'know?
Lil' cagey, y'know, don't like t'share trade secrets, that type'a thing.

## Well, uh -- damn, alright, so he's headed in, does that -- where does that leave us?
-- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya.

## My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask? You hurtin' pretty bad?
Mmm-hmm... and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em.

## True?
Like a mafucka.

## I feel like I know you girl. I feel like I've known you forever. You gonna lemme see your scars?
You do the right thing. Sit with me while I heal, let it develop slow.

## What were you doin' here anyway?
Spose to kill this fool named Buddy Israel.

## Why?
Wait, I'm getting some fucked up feedback off that earpiece --

## A Fed? Like FBI?
It's just a little casino inspection, don't trip, he's alone. Alright, let's set this spinnin'...

## Jus' remember, this is more rescuin' shit than rampagin' shit... What are you shootin'?
...Girl, y'know I had to bring big mamma through.

## You got the fifty up? Bitch y'tryin' t'take down a jumbo jet? Blown the moon out the sky? T'fuck you wanna get that grimy?
The try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! I'm layin' niggas out.

## ...So you heard from Keith? He still fuckin' with that 'lil light-skinned girl?
I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga.

## What!?
Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.

## Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
I ain't even goin' dignify that. You my road dog. We threw up sets. Plus you stank.

## -- I thought we had secure frequency. Aww girl, tell me this mafucka ain't goin' off right now.
What'd you say?

## What's wrong?
Security's locking down the elevators.

## C'mon, I say we bounce now, kick it for a lil' bit, play some craps. ...Maybe spend the night?
...Shhhhhhit... girl, there's these two dudes, just sittin' here in this elevator, all shot up...

## What?
They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was.

## Girl one of these fools has an FBI badge on him! Is this the one that was doing the inspection?
Hold up, hold up, I'm getting shots over the scanners, tons of traffic -- jus' chill for a sec, lemme listen...

## What else did Padiche say?
He said that the shit could get hot, could get heavy... I said good. 'Cuz I got two of the hottest, heaviest bitches alive.

## What's the time frame?
Right mafuck'n now girl. Fast as we can get you there. We wait any longer, someone goin' dead this fool.

## Can it work?
It can. Ordinary matter, like ours? Not affected. Everything else, disintegrates.

## No? Who am I, then?
A puppet.

## Didn't you talk to Snow?
I want to hear your version.

## I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation. Now, What happened to him?
The same thing that could happen to any of us.

## Where's his body?
In the lab. With her, probably.

## Her? Who are you talking about?
They shouldn't let people like you into space.

## Meaning Man can do whatever the fuck it wants?
Yes.

## No, she won't.
Why did you agree to come here?

## Why would you let her to do that?
You fucking bastard...

## Whose side are you on?
It's changing characteristics. It's solidifying taking on weight.

## How quickly?
If it continues, it will implode from its own weight and turn into a black hole in about four hours and pulls us in with it.

## Where's Snow? Did you call him?
Yes.

## What's wrong? What happened to Gibarian?
He's dead.

## What?
I can't talk just now. I'm too tired.

## Where's Sartorius?
In his lab. He won't let you in.

## Why, who did you see?
Gibarian warned me. He left me a message.

## She was real. Where did she come from?
Tell me. I won't think you're insane.

## How long can you go without sleep?
That depends.

## Was her breakfast conversation that bad?
Shut up.

## What was it?
Personally, I think it's God. At least, it fits my definition.

## And professionally?
My wife.

## She has materialized from your memory of her. What was her name?
Rheya.

## Will she come back?
Probably.

## What are you going to report back to Earth?
I don't know.

## Why?
Just a little strategy session. But in person this time.

## -- we are not sure of that. We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.
When you cut yourself pounding the door, did it hurt?

## If God is beyond our comprehension, and she -- -- is here for reasons that can't be understood, isn't God here?
Not necessarily.

## Who are you trying to convince?
We can liquidate the station. Take the Athena back.

## I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now. Why now?
But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything. Presented me with your double, and you with mine.

## What happened?
She knows everything. She knows who she is.

## What do you want?
I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan.

## What plan?
Just get him to stop.

## What do you want to do, leave the station with her?
Yes.

## You'll see her die, that's all. They're mortal, despite what she told you. She will die. Then what will you do?
I love her.

## When did this happen?
Oh, right away. That's why you never saw me with anyone. You should've noticed that. I miss him, though. I think I made a mistake.

## Why?
I don't know. I can't be alone.

## What are they?
To calm your anxiety.

## We're taking a flight?
Yes.

## Book?
Poem. Dylan Thomas. I thought of it when I saw you on the train.

## And tonight?
Better.

## You want to fuck her?
Stop it.

## Is it intelligent?
Intelligent beyond our comprehension.

## Then it's God, right?
It's something.

## But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang?
As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.

## You were trying to break down the door. Do you know why?
When I saw you were gone I got scared.

## Where've you been?
I been thinking about how much I hate you.

## I did too.
What kind of look?

## Why did you say those things?
I don't know. I couldn't understand why you didn't tell me.

## Do you have any idea how much I like fucking you?
I think so.

## What does Snow think you should do?
Sartorius wants to destroy it.

## You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?
It was obvious from the way he first looked at me.

## Do I really feel like... I am...?
Yes. Yes.

## What are you talking about?
That I am not Rheya. That Rheya died. Killed herself. I'm different.

## Who have you been talking to?
Sartorius.

## When? When I'm asleep?
I'm sure there are worse people to talk to, but I don't know who they are.

## Why did she do it?
You... she said I didn't love her.

## Was she right?
No. I love you.

## Can you sleep?
I don't think do. It's not sleep; it's something else. It's all around me.

## Do you?
If you're here.

## What's wrong?
Gibarian. He was here.

## What's happening to us?
It's all right.

## How could it be so cruel? How could it torture us like this?
I don't think it knows it's torturing us. It's just watching.

## What do I have to do to stop it?
I want you here.

## Who are you, then?
Yes. I told you. It was exactly like mine.

## Is that really what you want?
I want to stop taking those pills.

## I can't --
I have consciousness, but I am not mortal. Don't you see why I'm going crazy?

## Am I really her?
I don't know anymore. All I see is you.

## What does it want?
I don't know. Something. Anything.

## When?
Last night. You were talking to someone in the corridor.

## Why do you say that?
He won't.

## Fuck me. I knew it.
Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?

## You want it coming back with us?
You go ahead. Of what I remember about Earth... it's all one thing now. Everything's a blur. I like distinctions.

## You didn't like him?
Looks a little constipated to me.

## You still writing the occasional magazine article?
Occasionally.

## I'm sorry. I'm not sure how this works. I have to go out... is that all right?
Uh...

## Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
Right. That's true.

## Can we go then?
I'm supposed to call in.

## Do you have another tie? Something more conservative?
Oh... Yes... I don't have it with me. It's at home.

## What did he say?
He thinks you're being a little careless. He made the point several times.

## Queens... You know Queens?
My father founded a music school there. The Milton Gregory School.

## Are you nervous?
No, Ma'am.

## Beg pardon?
Since you're going to be my escort, you'll need a new tie.

## You all right?
Yeah.

## Claire?
Hmm...

## You wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in India, do you?
Urdu and Hindi.

## Didn't do very well, did you?
Nope... never finished one yet. I hate these things.

## You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
They're kind of fuzzy.

## So, this could be your last night, huh?
Could be, I guess.

## You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way?
Absolutely. Look at this.

## And \"is\"...?
Yeah.

## That's nice. And you live in Queens? With a child, and a dog...?
No dog.

## What's to like?
Tell it like it is.

## Open the door, will you?
I can't open it.

## Claire, will you calm down?
Yeah.

## You told her?
Not exactly.

## What do you want to do?
I don't know.

## When can I see you?
I don't know. Garber's left orders here not to let you in the building.

## Tomorrow night. Can you come?
I don't know. It wouldn't be very smart.

## Listen, you're right. Don't do it. I'll just... send you an address, okay?
Claire...

## Do you?
Pretty bad.

## They guys treatin' you all right?
Yeah.

## How long you going away for?
Long enough.

## \"For\"...?
Yeah. It's all over.

## You still going away?
I don't know...

## You're planning to speak?
Not if you don't want me to.

## Keep what handy?
Nothing.

## Mom, what's going to happen with you and Dad?
I don't know Tommy.

## Hey, can we go to McDonald's?
Absolutely.

## Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him?
Too kinky.

## What?
My ass if falling.

## Your what...?
My ass is falling. It is.

## What are you talking about?
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.

## Tomorrow, I start looking for our house... You love me?
You got no idea...

## So how'd it go?
Not great. I've got a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide.

## For how long?
Til they pick up the perp. Seniority gets day shift... You know what that means.

## Changing the sparks. They showed it on TV. What d'you think?
I think television's a dangerous thing.

## Okay?
Unbelievably handsome. You look fantastic in a suit.

## The real estate lady left, she couldn't wait anymore. What took you?
Oh, some shit.

## What shit, honey?
You don't want to hear about it.

## Why?
I think -- she's crazy.

## Where'd you get the tie?
Bought it.

## What did she say the down payment was?
She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.

## She took you shopping for a tie?
I had to follow her to a store.

## What's wrong with your paisley tie?
Ellie, it was a formal party...

## Excuse me! You went to a party with her?
I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...

## I know you're her bodyguard. Did she buy it or did you?
She bought it.

## Coming to bed?
Few minutes. Want to catch the news.

## What?
Mike, take it easy...

## What was that?
You heard me.

## What did you do tonight?
I watched TV.

## What did you watch?
I don't remember Michael, go to sleep. You don't have to make conversation with me.

## What's the difference?
Let me drive...

## Was it Venza? Did you get him?
No.

## What about when she goes out?
But I got him! He's in jail! Wasn't that the point...?!

## I heard a lot... Anything you want to deny, Mike?
It should've been me...

## Hey Mike, out of the bag into the bureau, huh... How do you like it so far?
Right behind you, T.J.

## Who's Joey Venza?
Shit! A Nursemaid! My first detail, and I'm a fuckin' slug! I got a 'choice' at all.

## You in this with me?
Yeah! Seniority gets the day shift.

## THING Ever shot anyone?
Yes.

## ... Hard?
THING Erect. You know, a \"boner?\" I'd heard that it gives you a boner, to shoot a man.

## Are you in charge here?
No, sir...

## Is she injured?
You're not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer.

## You're here 'til what time?
I'll bring her in. You let them go, and I'll bring her in.

## Why should she come in?
My special, scrambled eggs surprise.

## How do you know where the gun is?
I know where everything is.

## Yeah, I think so.
Lay back, Mack!! What's this \"lay back, Mack?\" Where does he get this?

## How are things going, pal?
Okay, I guess.

## How about dinner tonight?
Mom and I got plans.

## She's what?
She met some friend of Aunt Millie's who works for a record company. He thinks she's got a great voice.

## What! What kind of pathetic line is that?
We're gonna pass the street.

## You coming in?
No, I'm not coming in. And if you'd rather go to a \"singing lesson\" than have dinner with your father...

## So, what are you doing tonight?
Shooting.

## Shooting?
Yeah. She says we gotta get used to being alone in this neighborhood. 'Bye, Dad.

## And Flash isn't?
Be nice.

## Peter-- you took this picture?
No. No, that's okay.

## Same old stuff. How's the pharmacy?
Ah, ya know. Neighborhood's not what it used to be. Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.

## You stop him?
Wasn't worth gettin' upset over a Milky Way. Anyways, I was never much for, ya know, discipline.

## I know. Still thinking about retiring?
Eh. If I ever get out from under. Maybe take May to France or somethin'.

## Ya still follow the Mets, Pete?
Nonot really.

## Remember Little League?
Yeah, Babe Ruth you wasn't.

## Ya set for, uh, ya know-- money?
Oh, sure.

## They'll never take me alive.
See?

## What's in there?
A little bunny I saved from dissection.

## You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
Don't be pitiful.

## That's not even close.
You get mugged or something?

## Get inside and get pictures. Fifty bucks.
Are you okay?

## Can we make it a hundred?
Police, help! Po-- mmph.

## Hmf-hrr?
No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws.

## What's this? A cockaroach?
A spider. Eight legs.

## How about tomorrow?
You're making my life difficult.

## Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
An even five I throw in the jacket.

## Is that bug juice, or are you just glad to see me?
Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.

## Can I get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?
Thanks, I already ate.

## I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
Well...

## All right, amazing. Are you quite finished?
Just about. You see, I also have this amazing strength...

## Are you quite finished?
Just about. See, I also have this amazing strength.

## What if the world ends tomorrow?
Good morning, Liz.

## -- but the dogs treed him between Huxley and Kafka.
Huh?

## Poor Harry. Always desperate for attention. What about the bunny?
Back to the lab. Harry'll probably lose his scholarship.

## Since you're feeling guilty, why not donate your pretzel to somebody who needs it?
My my.

## What?
God, Flash can be such a jerk.

## But you like that in a man?
You should write that one down.

## What are you doing this weekend?
Hi, Adele.

## What's your problem?
I've got no problems.

## What's in the bag? Garbage?
Sort of. I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.

## This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
That was then. I'm better since the lobotomy.

## Do you mind if I come too?
I think I'd like that.

## You're not trained for that. None of us are... I mean, sometimes I... Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then? Are you bulletproof?
Well, no.

## You'd feel what?
I know what you mean. I...

## Hello. Earth to Peter. Are you listening?
Unh-huh. Excuse me. I've gotta go.

## Peter?
I'm here...

## Hello. So very boring. Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
This may be the end of a beautiful friendship, you know.

## Some of him char-broiled bones. Teeth. We ruled out suicide. Any bad blood between him and Ock?
I know him.

## Yeah, Roz.
It's a lot of ground to cover. We'll try. Funny coincidence, huh?

## Aunt May, you're trespassing.
Any sign of our friend?

## It's Friday night...
Your records are older than you are. Have you never heard of new wave?

## Yes. Do you have a date?
No.

## What the hell is that?
Tofu. Ben, I wish you wouldn't.

## Aunt May, what happened?
I was napping on the couch. There was a voice and a shot. I woke up. Ben was looking at me.

## How is he?
He'll be fine. They won't tell me anything, but I'm sure he'll be fine.

## You're wrong. Just for a moment, I heard, saw, felt-- I became Creation.
Is this some sort of Zen thing?

## Creation? Or its opposite?
Truth. Pure, eternal. Beyond the boundaries of mere mortality.

## Peter, what can I do for you?
An extension on that astronomy paper? Because, uh...

## Not a lot. I saw inside of the Science Center. What exactly happened?
Only Octavius knows for sure. And last time I spoke to him, he was on the planet Whiz-Bang.

## Need any more help?
No, thank you. I'm sure you've got your own problems.

## Letterman show, NBC. We'll talk then. Bye.
Kid, you were terrific. Max Reiss, novelty acts. Was that judo or something? Ah, skip it. Question is, can you do it again?

## Like it?
Nah. The big mask was better.

## So they're airing this tonight?
Yup. Oh, here's your check, minus my commission. Solid, solid novelty act.

## I sent for the police. We can explain.
... a couple a drinks at Sardi's?

## Explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles?
Right. Let's go.

## The usual. Heredity and environment. What's the deal with Doc Ock?
He'll try to finish his experiment.

## And blow up the universe just to prove he's right? Bit egotistical, isn't it?
A messianic complex is nothing new to Octavius. In his universe, there's only one mind-- his own. It must be very lonely.

## Do you... live around here?
No, but I've got this secret identity to worry about. I'll swing the rest of the way.

## They may. That's why I would keep my mouth shut.
Professor, you ever fly one of these things before?

## What's wrong with him?
Plenty.

## How did he ever find out about that ammunition train?
You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.

## Is you all good Nazis?
Jawohl.

## We made a deal with Barrack One.
Is you all little Adolfs?

## Any news on Dunbar?
He's still in the Kommandant's office. That's all I know.

## Where's Hoffy? Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?
Roger.

## Three's a crowd, especially if you've got to cut your way through barbed wire. Here's the wire cutters. Are the civilian clothes ready?
Coming up.

## W-w-will that do or do you want some m-m-m --?
That'll do.

## What's the matter? You on their team now? You think I'm the guy?
I don't know anymore.

## In this barracks?
Why not? Just one of the boys. Sharing our bunks. Eating our chow. Right in amongst the ones that beat me up. Except that he beat hardest.

## If you don't want to tell me, why don't you tell Hoffy? Or Security?
Yeah. Security.

## Now what kind of a crack is that?
No crack. Two packs of cigarettes say they don't get out of the forest.

## Anybody here wanna double their bet?
Private property, bub.

## Come on, Trader Horn! Let's hear it, what'd you give the Krauts for that egg?
Forty-five cigarettes. The price has gone up.

## Look, this may be my last hot breakfast on account of they're going to take away that stove. So will you let me eat it in peace?
That's right.

## Ask Security. You tell him, Price. You've got me shadowed every minute of the day. Or haven't you found out yet?
I grease the Kraut guards. With ten percent of the take.

## A little something what?
Yeah, what about it? Cut the horsing around. We know he's the stoolie and we know what the pay- off is. Let's get on with it.

## Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
You make my mouth water.

## What are you looking at him for? Any objections, Sefton?
Take it.

## Why not?
Have a cigar.

## No? Aren't you a little afraid to turn the stoolie loose on that compound? For a tip-off like this, you know what the Krauts would pay?
Here's the knife to do it with. Only make sure you got the right throat.

## How much more do we have to take from him?
There'll be no vigilante stuff. Not while I'm Barrack Chief.

## How did he get over there?
Easy! Walked right through the gate, past the guard. Like he was some Kraut Field Marshal.

## Then we're all in on it?
Everybody but Joey, and you know who.

## Cut out the guff, Schulz. We're on to you. You know everything that's happening in this barrack. Who's tipping you off?
Tipping me off? I do not understand.

## Which one of you is what?
Twenty-five.

## What did you expect, glamor boy? The Officers' Club with a steam room and a massage maybe?
Not you.

## What some brandy?
Yeah.

## What are the chances busting out of here?
We'll know in forty seconds. Only in a democracy can a poor guy get his keister shot off with a rich guy.

## What is your number?
105-353.

## I'm okay here. Why bother?
No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.

## I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.
Ever try forty sleeping pills?

## Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.

## What do you do for heat in this barrack? No stove?
The men here used it for a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily.

## I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar. Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
It is.

## What exactly is he charged with?
Interesting.

## Isn't it?
Jawohl.

## What is this? This is water?
It's a mouse trap.

## Me? What if she don't want me?
If she don't want you, she don't get anything.

## No?
Don't you remember, Animal? A chicken lays those things.

## Thanks. You're a real pal! What're we goin' to do with it?
Plant it, Animal, and grow us a chicken for Christmas.

## It takes a gimmick, Animal, and I figured us a little gimmick.
You clocked him! Why don't I clock you?

## You did?
Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.

## What do they always say?
That's what I wanna hear.

## You hold him. I'll slug him.
Sugar-lips Shapiro! Frightening, ain't it?

## Why don't we just look in those footlockers?
Come on, you little stooge. Hand over them keys.

## Let me do it, Hoffy.
There, Joey -- ain't that better than being a lawyer?

## You want to go?
No. I want to draw.

## Yes, Sergeant Hoffman?
As the duly elected Compound Chief, I protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud.

## Anything else?
Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial.

## Good evening, Sergeants. A bit dank in here, isn't it?... Where is the Baracken-Fuehrer?
Yes, sir.

## ...a Lieutenant James Dunbar?
Yes, sir.

## Wait a minute. We have some rights here. Why is this man being taken out?
Curtains would do wonders for this barrack. You will not get them.

## Cut the horseplay, Harry. What's the matter with you guys?
And don't blame me if you all wind up in the cooler.

## What are you going to do?
I want everybody out of here. We'll need a lot of commotion on the compound.

## Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?
Good.

## What about Schulz?
We'll take care of Schulz. Come on.

## Any objections, men?
What do you say, Hoffy. We'll hit the air raid trenches and cut out in back of Barracks nine.

## Why the south latrine?
Because that's where he is. In the water tank.

## What radio?
The one you are hiding in the barrack, don't you know? The one your friend without the leg is smuggling all over the compound.

## A little weak today.
Just one question. Did you calculate the risk?

## Are we boring you?
What's the big idea, Sefton? Take that telescope out of here.

## Says who?
Says me.

## With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
Lay off, I said -- if you don't want your head handed to you.

## What's the matter, boys? Is my slip showing?
I'll say it is. You spilled a little borscht on it.

## What happened, Cookie? Who did it?
We did it.

## You heard that, Sefton?
Sure I heard it. I still got one good ear.

## So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
Okay, Price. You stay.

## How do they know?
You told them, Hoffy.

## Uh-huh. Fell right on my head. Sprechen sie deutsch?
Don't you know? Because I got my own ideas. Let's have that civilian stuff.

## You taking Dunbar?
You betcha. There ought to be some reward money from Mama. Say ten thousand bucks worth.

## Pirelli. Coleman. Agnew. Shapiro.
What's the decoy?

## Nothing for Kuzawa?
Shapiro. Shapiro.

## Give this to Joey, will you?
Oh.

## Just one little thing. How come you were so sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
I wasn't so sure. I just liked the odds.

## And what's that crack supposed to mean?
They're lying dead in the mud out there and I'm trying to find out how come.

## What about the radio?
Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.

## I thought that's what you said. You're from Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?
Thirty-fifth.

## Are you questioning me?
Just getting acquainted. Trying to make one friend in this barracks.

## Are we going to stand around here and listen to him until the Germans find out where Dunbar is?
The Germans know where Dunbar is.

## I'll kill you for that!
December seventh, forty-one.

## What time?
Six o'clock. I was having dinner.

## The what?
The one you took out of the corner of your bunk and put in this pocket.

## Say, Schulz -- you guys had machine gun practice last night?
Ach, terrible! Such foolish boys. Such nice boys. I'd better not talk about it. It makes me sick to my stomach.

## All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself. Now let's see.
Suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little -- just out of decency?

## Nun? Was ist? Haben Sie's herausgefunden?
Ich weiss alles.

## Wie hat er's gemacht?
Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...

## You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can -- Silk stockings?
Not particularly.

## Russian women prisoners?
Yeah. We were just passing out guns.

## Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
That is my wife.

## Look at them, Lieutenant. Everybody is a clown! How do you expect to win the war with an army of clowns?
From a chicken, bug-wit.

## Is it all right if we smell it?
Just don't drool on it.

## That wouldn't be the cigarettes you took us for last night?
What was I going to do with them? I only smoke cigars.

## So you're stuck with me, eh?
Maybe those Russian dames would take him.

## You're not disposing of those Russian broads?
Tell you what to do. First, get yourself a hundred cigarettes for the Kraut guards. Then get yourself another face.

## Where is he?
I thought he was the Chief Engineer.

## Data?
Sorry, Captain. The ribbon has already entered the galaxy. It will pass through this sector in approximately thirty-one hours.

## What do you mean?
I wanted to save Geordi. I tried. But I experienced something I did not expect. I believe it was fear.

## But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend. Does that make me a coward?
This is its current position.

## Courage is an emotion too, Data. Now, can you project the course of the ribbon?
I believe so.

## Now, you said the gravitational forces in this sector have been altered, could that also affect the course of the ribbon?
I believe so.

## He can't go to the ribbon, so he's trying to make the ribbon come to him. Data, is it going to pass near any M-Class planets?
Yes, sir. There are two in the Veridian system.

## Are any of them inhabited?
Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.

## Population?
Approximately two hundred thirty million.

## Is she still angry?
No, but I'd stay out of Sickbay for a while if I were you. I still don't know why you dropped her in the water.

## Data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?
It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.

## But at the first sign of trouble, I'm going to deactivate it. Agreed?
Agreed.

## Well?
I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.

## Really? What do you feel?
I am uncertain. I have had little experience with emotions. I am unable to articulate the sensation.

## What?
I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.

## Looks like you're stuck with emotions for a while. How do you feel?
I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.

## Could we access the defective coil and trigger their cloak?
The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance, three light years.

## Do you remember him?
Oh yes. I remember everyone who was on the Lakul, every face. Even the ones who didn't make it.

## What happened to you?
I can't remember very much - what it looked like or how long I was there. But I do remember how it felt.

## Your \"sixth sense\"- I've always wondered where it came from. And what about Soran?
Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.

## Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?
You're in the Nexus.

## This is the Nexus?
For you. This is where you wanted to be.

## Soran?
All of us.

## Where is he now?
Wherever he wanted to be.

## Yes, where would you go?
I don't understand.

## I can't leave. I'm already there, remember?
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.

## Well, may we have a look around?
Please, please.

## You left spacedock without a tractor beam?
It won't be installed until Tuesday. Ensign Sulu, try generating a subspace field around the ships. That might break them free.

## Beautiful day, isn't it?
Yes, yes, it is.

## Temporal nexus, yeah, I heard you. Something's missing.
So you're telling me this is the 24th-century, and I'm dead?

## No, no, it's not. It's better.
You said history considers me dead. Who am I to argue with history?

## Better?
This is my uncle's barn in Iowa.

## Antonia?
She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.

## Captain of the Enterprise, huh?
That's right.

## Close to retirement?
I hadn't planned on it.

## How can I argue with the captain of the Enterprise? What was the name of that planet=8A Veridian III?
That's right.

## I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
You could say that.

## Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
Yes. Thank you.

## Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
It's like you always said- if something's important enough, you make the time.

## An anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8A it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.
Phasing? To where?

## A photon torpedo?
Aye.

## Where are the deflector relays?
Normal is what everyone else is, and what you are not.

## I don't want a science lecture. You were on that observatory looking for trilithium. Why?
I was ordered to by the Captain.

## What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about.

## When we went to ancient Rome for Deanna's promotion, we threw her to the lions, remember?
Well, now that we're all aboard=8A Number One, bring the ship before the wind. Let's see what's out there.

## Sir?
Make it so.

## There's still no indication of why they attacked the station?
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.

## Is there a problem?
No, sir.

## Sir, is there anything wrong?
No. Thank you.

## How is that possible?
Maybe they're not out there.

## Too big. How long until the ribbon arrives?
I always thought I'd have a crack at this chair one day.

## Captain, are you all right?
Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.

## Counselor. What can I do for you?
Actually, I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.

## Your family history is very important to you, isn't it?
You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line.

## Doctor Soran?
Yes, yes, Captain. Thank you for coming.

## What if I told you I found a new truth?
The Nexus.

## Well, that narrows it to Klingon, Breen or Romulan.
The royal...studs?

## Trilithium?
Why were they looking for it on a Federation observatory? It doesn't make any sense.

## Plasma coils...is there any way we can use that to our advantage?
I do not see how. The plasma coil is part of their cloaking device.

## What's going on? When do we get paid off...?
Soon, Captain... Quite soon.

## Mr. Chekov -- ?
An energy reading from 'C\" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...

## Will we get another ship?
I can't get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand... and wait.

## Shall I alert Dr. McCoy?
Yes. He has a long journey ahead.

## Response?
Nothing. As before.

## Bones... Can you give me a quadrant bi-scan?
I'd swear something was there sir, but I might have imagined it.

## What did you see, Chekov?
For an instant... A scout class vessel.

## Scotty...?
Aye sir, coding now.

## Do you wish to advise Starfleet, sir?
Wait a minute...! We don't know what we're talking about here...

## I don't believe it...
Could it be Spock's?

## Why don't we beam it up?
Not from here, no.

## David!... What went wrong?
I went wrong.

## Underground deposit?
Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.

## What is it?
Spock's burial robe.

## Saavik... My god, what happened to them?
It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.

## It's time for total truth between us. This planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?
Not exactly.

## Why?
This planet is aging in surges.

## ... How long?
Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable. I'm sorry.

## Grissom to landing party. We have you approaching radioactive indications. Do you concur?
Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.

## Do you have an explanation?
Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...

## Ah, Saavik, that's, ah, extroadinary. What would you, ah, like to do next?
Request permission to beam aboard immediately.

## Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
None that I can detect, sir.

## Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
Your reputation is secure, Scotty. Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'll be in my quarters.

## Mr. Scott?
I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.

## Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so...
Sir...?

## Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
What's wrong?

## Saavik... Is... David with you?
Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.

## This Vulcan -- is he alive?
He is not himself -- but he lives. He is subject to rapid aging -- like this unstable planet.

## What happened...?
He gave his life to save us. That is all I know.

## What? What are you saying?
The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body.

## And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
. He will remain always as he is.

## I know you... Do I not?
Yes. And I know you.

## Why would you do this...?
Because... the needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many.

## Very well. Mr. Chekov, I need pre-approach scan... Take the science station, please.
The ship... Out of danger...?

## ... Admiral, what's going to happen to Enterprise?
She's to be decommissioned.

## The word, sir?
The word is no. I am therefore going anyway.

## Can we hold speed, Mr. Scott?
We are secured from Warp Speed... Now entering Genesis Sector of Mutara Quadrant.

## What about Grissom, Mr. Chekov?
See! That shimmering area.

## That distortion is closing rapidly... Opinion, Sulu?
I think it's an energy form, sir...

## ... A cloaking device?
About a dozen officers and men.

## Uhura, any response from Starfleet on our Project Genesis inquiries?
No, sir, no response.

## Hmm.. Very odd. Scotty. Progress report?
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.

## Would you look at that?
My friends, the great experiment, Excelsior, ready for trial runs...

## How is Doctor McCoy, sir?
That's the good news. He's home in bed, full of tranquilizers, and he promised me he'd stay there... They say it's exhaustion... We'll see.

## Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
Yes, Admiral. Step into my parlor.

## Will you be able to handle that...?
Oh, I'll have \"Mr. Adventure\" eating out of my hand. And I'll see you at the rendezvous. All my hopes.

## Where's Doctor McCoy?
Indisposed, sir.

## May I ask why...?
There are two more prisoners, Admiral. Do you want them killed too? Surrender your vessel!

## But, why?
Because you wish it.

## Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
Don't be a fool -- give me your hand!

## But -- why?
He would not have spoken of it openly.

## What must I do?
You must bring them to Mount Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find peace...

## They know we would die first.
What about Spock?

## How can you tell that?
My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.

## My Lord... what are your orders?
I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...

## But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
Our mission is over. I have failed... A human has been bolder and more ruthless than I... That -- is the real dishonor.

## How is that...?
A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place, the hind end of space.

## The closet?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
This isn't reality. This is fantasy.

## Physician, heal thyself.
But dear Lord, are we intelligent enough to -- Suppose, this thing were used where life already exists?

## That's all you have to say?
I'm not a drama critic.

## Wouldn't it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship?
They'll learn. Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, doctor.

## Bless me, doctor; and what beams you into this neck of the woods?
Beware Romulans bearing gifts.' Happy Birthday...

## Uh -- what are they?
For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens.

## Damn it, Jim, what the hell's the matter? Other people have birthdays. Why're we treating yours like a funeral?
From yourself, Admiral.

## What about the rest of the inspection, Admiral?
The inspection will continue once we're underway, Doctor.

## I've got the sick bay ready. Will someone please tell me what is going on?
Computer. Request security procedure and access to Project Genesis Summary.

## Doctors lose patients sometimes. Damn. I'm still in the dark, How'd he know about Genesis?
There may still be time... you gave as good as you got.

## Go? Where are we going?
Where they went. Saavik.

## But what if they went -- nowhere?
Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all.

## How can you think of food at a time like this?
Our first order of business is survival.

## You okay, Jim? How do you feel?
Young. I feel young, Doctor.

## En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened? Has something happened? Do you read us?
All went well. Nothing has happened. Ceti Alpha VI has checked out.

## Will you please be quiet! Commander Chekov, this is completely irregular. Who gave the order you are quoting? Who gave the order?
The order comes from Starfleet command, Dr. Marcus, direct from the General Staff.

## Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?
... Can't read you... repeat...

## Repeat... what's wrong? What's wrong?
... taking Genesis away from us...

## What order? Who's taking Genesis?
... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority...

## Why? Why didn't you tell me?
It is a far far better thing I do than I have ever done before... a far better resting place I go to than I have ever known...

## Is that a poem?
I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.

## I don't understand. Who's responsible for all this? Who is Khan?
But we can't just sit here -- !

## He left us. We were no longer of use. SAAVIK Where is the Reliant crew? Dead?
Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's completely mad, Admiral. He blames you for the death of his wife...

## Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.

## Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I.

## I see. Helmsman?
Well done, Commander.

## I suppose I was. I poured a drink. Would you like it?
No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.

## Is that what you came here to say?
Mainly. And also that I'm proud -- very proud -- to be your son.

## What are you looking at?
The Admiral's son.

## What are you looking at?
I don't know.

## Well?
Warp drive still inoperative. All other systems should be restored shortly.

## That is a most intriguing offer. Typical, I must say of your sterling character. Let me think.
What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?

## Thirty seconds...
Genesis, what's that?

## Khan, how do I know you'll keep your word?
I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.

## Chekov, who is this man?
All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...

## Uhura. Can't you augment?
I'm trying, sir. Stand by...

## Spock?
Mr. Scott on discrete.

## Sensors, Captain?
I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.

## Oh? A wee bout of what, Mr. Scott?
Midshipman, you're a tiger.

## Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself. Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?
Give the word, Admiral.

## WHY?
He wants to kill me for passing sentence on him 14 years ago -- and he doesn't care who stands between him and his vengeance.

## Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report, Spock?
Admiral, if we go by the book, like Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem like days.

## Meaning you can't even beam us back?
Not at present.

## Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours. Are you about ready?
Right on schedule, Admiral. Just give us your coordinates and we'll beam you aboard.

## And who is this?
Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR.

## Your first training voyage, Mr. Preston?
Yes, SIR.

## I see. Well, shall we start with the engine room?
I believe you'll find everything shipshape, Admiral.

## Is the word given?
The word is given, warp speed.

## It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
None of which I am consciously aware -- except, of course, happy birthday -- surely the best of times.

## The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?
Home.

## Permission to come aboard, Captain?
Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.

## Will you accompany me to the bridge?
I'd best talk with Mr. Scott, first so that he may, in his own words, explain the situation to his cadets.

## How far?
Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed.

## Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
It might help my analysis if I knew what Genesis was.

## WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And why?
One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.

## Who the hell are they?
Admiral, you can't give him Genesis...

## The prefix code?
It's all we've got.

## ... Blind as a Tiberian Bat. What do you make of the plantoid beyond?
Regula is class \"D'. It consists of various remarkable ores. Essentially, a great rock in space.

## Engine room... Scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters?
All right, join the party. Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.

## What IS working around here?
Not much, Admiral. We have partial main power...

## That's it?
Best we could do in two hours.

## Scotty, can we make it inside?
I think we can guarantee she'll follow us, Mr. Saavik. Remind me to explain to you the concept of human ego.

## He won't break off now. If he followed me this far he'll be back. But from where...?
He's intelligent, but not experienced. His pattern indicates two dimensional thinking...

## Uhura, if you don't hear from us, there won't be anybody behind. Kirk out. You gentleman can remain here, or...
I never took the Kobayashi Maru test -- until now. What do you think of my solution?

## Any suggestions, Admiral?
Prayer, Mr. Saavik. The Klingons do not take prisoners. Captain.

## Permission to speak candidly, sir?
Very well.

## And why not?
Because... there was no way to win.

## A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. Has that never occurred to you?
... No, sir. It has not.

## How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say?
As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.

## Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?
It is still regulation, Admiral.

## May I speak, sir?
Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.

## May I ask how you dealt with the test?
Reliant's command...

## Admiral?
As your teacher Mr. Spock is fond of saying, I like to think there always are possibilities.

## What's on your mind, Lieutenant?
The Kobayashi Maru, sir.

## Are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now, Lieutenant?
On the test, sir, will you tell me what you did? I'd really like to know.

## How?
I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.

## WHAT?
I changed the conditions of the test. I received a commendation for original thinking. I don't like to lose.

## We are clear and free to navigate.
Mr. Scott, can you get the mains back on line?

## Course heading, Captain?
Prepare for warp speed.

## What did you expect, Lieutenant?
He's very human.

## Lieutenant, how many times have you piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?
Never, sir.

## Where must you go?
To Earth. To offer testimony.

## Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
I would accept that as an axiom.

## How're you doing?
Fine. Just fine.

## Gillian --
Well, so much for the tour of our humble plant. I must say, Professor your knowledge of engineering is most impressive.

## Indeed... May I offer you gentlemen anything?
He never jokes... Perhaps the professor could use your computer.

## No! No... What did you have in mind...?
A moment alone, please.

## What do you mean?
It'll come back to him.

## You're really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket?
We've done it before.

## Jim, you've got to let me go in there! Don't leave him in the hands of Twentieth Century medicine.
Would you prefer to do nothing?

## What did you say she was getting?
Cramps.

## Hi... Busy?
Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.

## Forget it... How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?
I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines.

## You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
Pardon me, Doctor, I am hearing many calls of distress.

## Really? You think this is its way of saying \"Hi there\" to the people of the Earth?
There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.

## That's crazy! Who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale?
... My God...

## Then how.?
Angels and ministers of grace, defend us.

## Naturally. So what is your problem?
Acceleration is no longer a constant.

## ... Best shot...?
Guess, Spock. Your best guess.

## What the hell do you think you're doing?
Reading the patient's vital signs.

## We're out of control -- Rig for collision...
What's your degree in, dentistry?

## Find it?
Yes, under \"U.S. Government.\" Now we need directions.

## How long?
Depends on how much shielding is between us and the reactor.

## Like what?
Like who you really are and what you're doing here and what this thing is.

## My name?
Okay... Make nice and give us the ray gun.

## That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...?
Shields, Mr. Chekov.

## Understood. What is your plan?
Cloaking device is stable... All systems normal.

## \"Neutralized?\" How?
We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...

## Can you protect us?
We are launching everything we have.

## I suppose they told you that...?
The hell they did.

## Is there something wrong with the one I have?
You mean man...

## How soon?
Soon... It's too bad because they're very friendly as you can see. I've grown quite attached to them... This way.

## Came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh?
There's really very little point in my trying to explain.

## I buy that. What about him?
He's harmless. Back in the sixties he was part of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley. I think he did too much LDS.

## Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
Iowa.

## Can I ask you something?
Go ahead.

## What's going to happen when you release the whales?
They're gonna hafta take their chances.

## He's just going to hang around the bushes while we eat?
It's his way.

## Do you trust me?
Implicitly.

## So how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?
Just lucky, I guess.

## How will that be done, exactly?
They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.

## Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.

## My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.

## Who do you think I am?
Don't tell me, you're from outer space.

## All right. The truth?
I'm all ears.

## You want the details?
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.

## Sorry, that's classified. I don't really have a clue who you are... You wouldn't want to show me around your space ship, would you?
It wouldn't be my first choice, no.

## Here... In the park?
Right.

## Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.

## I belong here. Suppose by some miracle you do get them through. Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
... You have a point...

## Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you?
Don't worry. I'll find you. See you around the galaxy...

## Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
Well, I... find that understandable I mean, you've been through a lot. Station, please.

## To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion.
Spock -- you're suggesting the transmission is meant for life form other than man?

## Spock...?
As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.

## Spock, could the Humpback's answer to this call be simulated?
The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.

## Is there any other planet where this species exists?
The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.

## But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
There is one, but I cannot guarantee its success. We could attempt to find some Humpback Whales.

## Mr. Spock, your computations?
In progress, Admiral.

## What is our target in time?
The late 20th Century.

## You've programmed that from memory...?
I have.

## Earth... But when?... Spock?
Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century.

## And they will be again, Spock. That's the beauty of it. How much?
Simple logic will suffice. We need a map. That one should do.

## How do you know this...?
... Simple logic.

## For example?
Oh, the complete works of Jacqueline Susan, the novels of Harold Robbins....

## Yes?
About those colorful metaphors we discussed. I don't think you should try to use them.

## Why not?
Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.

## What else did you learn from your mind meld?
They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.

## They have a right to be... Do you think they'll help us?
I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.

## He meant what you were saying on the tour, that if things keep on the way they're going, humpbacks will disappear forever.
How will playing cards help?

## Status?
The tank will be finished by morning...

## That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.

## Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?
No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.

## Mr. Spock, where the hell is the power you promised me?
Admiral, you must wait one damn minute.

## Can we make breakaway speed!?
Hardly, Admiral, I cannot even guarantee we will escape the Sun's gravity! I will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory.

## Spock... Did braking thrusters fire?
They did, Admiral.

## Guidance is functional. Onboard Computer will interface with Federation memory bank...
Then... Where the hell are we?

## Weapons systems?
Estimating Planet Earth one point six hours present speed.

## Continue on course. Chekov, any signs of Federation escort?
Communications Systems ready. Communications Officer -- ready as she'll ever be.

## What is it?
Yes, sir.

## We'll stick together till we get orientated. Bearing to the whales?
283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...

## Any luck...?
Nothing... I should never have left him...

## Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway?
Give me one more day, sir. The damage control is easy. Reading Klingon is hard.

## Scotty, how long is this bay?
About 60 feet, Admiral.

## I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim?
Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks.

## Humpbacked - people.?
Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.

## Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember, two of them.

## Two?
It takes two to tango, Mr. Scott.

## I can't believe we've come this far only to be stopped by this! Scotty, is there any way dilithium can be re-crystallized?
Sorry, sir. We can't even do that in the 23rd Century.

## Scotty, Are the whale tanks secure?
Aye. But I've never beamed up 400 tons before.

## How long, Scotty?
I'll have to re-energize.

## The explosive override -- ?
Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship.

## Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause. How are you feeling?
Of course.

## ... Yes?
I notice you're still working with polymers.

## Sill? What else would I be working with?
That's easy, 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.

## Hello? Computer...?
Just use the keyboard...

## Transparent aluminum?
Oh, here and there. I flew something similar in my Academy days.

## Father...?
I will be returning to Vulcan within the hour... I wanted to take my leave of you.

## Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
Tell her I feel fine...

## Ojichan? Akira ojichaan dewa naino? Koko de nani shiteru no?
Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na. I'm sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else.

## Chotto omachi nasarei. Namae wa nanto moosareruka na. Wait my son. What is your name?
Sulu Hikaru.

## Capability, yes. But where can warp drive take us, except away from here...?
I understand how you feel. We just want to retrace Data's movements that day...

## Why?
I don't like to leave questions unanswered.

## I know what a hologram is, Captain. The question is -- why would someone want to create one of our village?
Data, if you were following the boy and discovered this ship...

## Deceive us?
Don't panic...

## I've been shot at... thrown into the lake out of an invisible ship that's come to abduct us all... what's there to panic about?
We've... just begun to. I suppose you're seventy-five.

## An apprentice for thirty years. We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change.

## A perfect moment?
When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...

## There's one thing I don't understand. In three hundred years...you never learned to swim?
I just... haven't gotten around to it yet.

## ... an offlander?
For someone so young.

## Jak'tahla?
Right beyond that ridge is where the caves begin... we can hide for days...

## What's the rush?
I should warn you... I've always been attracted to older women...

## Mother and son. You arranged this...?
I thought it might begin the healing process.

## Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people?
The \"mighty\" Federation could learn a few things from this village...

## You're what?
I am better.

## Not everyone here agrees with him. I mean, you know, about machines. There was even a big fight about it once. Do you like being a machine?
I aspire to be more than I am.

## Don't you ever get tired?
My power cells continually re- charge themselves.

## Really?
Really.

## Do machines ever play?
Because you're it. And if you tag me... then I'm it.

## Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?
Androids... don't have...fun.

## Why not...?
No one's ever asked me that before.

## Can he breathe under water?
Data doesn't breathe.

## Won't he rust?
No.

## The artificial lifeform was right?
If not for Data, you'd probably have been re-located by now.

## VOICE And our people?
They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...

## VOICE Are they in any danger?
VOICE Very good, Doctor. Picard out.

## Will he live?
Yes. But look at this medscan...

## Is it safe to move her?
Safer than leaving her here.

## Captain, Geordi...?
You're aboard the Enterprise.

## What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku...
How about a passive radiation scan?

## Why would the Federation or the Son'a wish to move the Ba'ku?
I don't know.

## How many?
Another forty-three people reported taken, sir...

## Will the structure hold if we blast through?
I believe it is safe, sir.

## Picard's first officer. Do you really believe he'll listen?
You're not going to launch anything until...

## You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?
... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...

## What kind of concerns?
Captain, I wasn't expecting you.

## You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?
In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.

## You're not finished here?
Just a few loose ends to tie up. Dougherty out.

## Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
A planet in Federation space...

## How many people would it take... before it becomes wrong? A thousand? Fifty thousand. A million?
Order them to surrender, and I promise you won't be court- martialed.

## Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?
I'm not begging for my life. I'm begging for yours. There is still a way home, Gal'na.

## Do you know how to disable the injector?
But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.

## Gallatin! So the righteous Starfleet Captain finally released you. Did you encounter any problems on the surface?
No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...

## Recommendations?
There is an alternative to an all- out assault. Isolinear tags would allow our transporters to lock on to them.

## May I talk to you alone?
Deploy the collector.

## Are they...?
We're about to lose communications with Starfleet, Captain.

## The torque sensors are out of alignment... by twelve microns... you could hear that?
When I was an ensign, I could detect a three-micron mis- alignment...

## Do you know how they were damaged?
By a Son'a weapon. There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.

## Why would they fire at him without provocation?
All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was activated...

## Fail-safe?
His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...

## Implants bothering you?
It's nothing. I'm just tired.

## A photon torpedo. Isn't that the universal greeting when communications are down?
I think it's the universal greeting when you don't like someone.

## Will that stop the tear?
You got me, Commander.

## That's your expert opinion?
We're pulling it like a zipper across space...

## VOICE Options?
Eject the core.

## The purpose being...?
I wouldn't be surprised if history remembers this as the Riker Maneuver...

## Why not?
Sir, they've detonated an isolytic burst... a subspace tear is forming...

## How long 'til they reach us?
Eighteen minutes...

## What's inside that nebula cluster?
Cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon gas... we don't want to go in there, sir...

## Deck ten.
... so they need us to put out one more brush fire. Anyone remember when we used to be explorers?

## Who is it?
Commander Riker...

## So where are the 'environmental concerns' the Admiral was talking about?
The only unusual readings were low levels of metaphasic radiation from interstellar dust across the region...

## Would you like something to eat?
No, we're here to... rescue them.

## You've not aged a day since then?
Actually, I was a good deal older when we arrived... in terms of my physical condition.

## Worf, what the hell are you doing here?
It's good to have you back, Worf. Slow to one-third. Take us in.

## Sir?
Hmm? Oh, it's just something my mother used to...

## Do you know Gilbert and Sullivan?
No, sir. I haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I've been back...

## Did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings?
No, sir...

## Debrief them again. Have you been in a fight, Commander?
No, sir. It is a gorch.

## Gorch?
Doctor Crusher asked to talk to you when you returned...

## Should I distribute phasers to the Ba'ku, sir...?
No. We'll be responsible for that, Mister Worf.

## Can you beam him off?
Negative. He's established a security field around the control room...

## Is there any other way to disable the injector?
... Population three hundred million...

## Counselor?
They have an incredible clarity of perception, Captain. I've never encountered a species with such mental discipline...

## Why was Data assigned?
\"Environmental concerns\", again. An android could be safely exposed to the elements during the installation of a duck blind...

## What are they interested in...?
Wine, women and song.

## Why would we be involved with these people?
Good question.

## What...?
What you're doing to my neck...

## Was I doing something to your neck?
It says here that some form of genetic damage has apparently prevented the Son'a from procreating...

## No children?
If that's true, they're a dying race.

## Got a minute? I... need a little counseling. First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what?
Whatever makes you comfortable...

## Why don't you try sitting up?
Or you could try lying down.

## Augh?
Initiate launch sequence.

## This ship is equipped with fourteen long range transporters... are they all useless...?
2 They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.

## Admiral... what's the status of the Borg fleet?
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.

## Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
Yes...

## Well, why didn't you just say so in the first place?
It's Cochrane.

## Are you saying they won't help us?
I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.

## I have to go back to the silo. Will you be all right?
I'll be fine. He's a different story.

## You actually performed surgery...?
It was an experience. Metal scalpels... needle and thread...

## He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed. Any word from the Enterprise?
Not yet.

## You think they're still up there?
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.

## How long has he been unconscious?
At least four hours.

## Um... yeah. Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
We have two... but we don't have the juice to run them.

## You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg...?
Intelligence... ambition... desire... I bring order to chaos...

## Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh?
It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference.

## You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel?
I do not know what you are referring to.

## Do you know what this is, Data?
It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.

## Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
I... do not want this...

## Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.

## A universe of sensation is waiting for you... don't you want to explore it... with me?
Yes...

## Isn't it better like this...?
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...

## Vulcan?
No.

## Can you configure it?
I believe so.

## Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
It has entered Earth orbit. Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.

## What?
I have helm control.

## Where's the Sphere?
The vortex is collapsing, sir.

## What year is it?
According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063.

## Who are you?
I am the Borg.

## Did you know her?
Not very well. We met shortly after the Enterprise-E was commissioned. I found her to be a most... promising officer.

## Data... are you sure you're all right?
I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse...

## \"APR cell count?\" What the hell are you talking about?
Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.

## Juice?
Power. There hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. Most of the batteries are depleted.

## Where?
Outside, around back. Next to the water tank.

## Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he?
Understood. Keep me informed.

## How serious is the damage?
I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.

## Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...

## Ready to make a little history?
Always am.

## What's still there?
Their com system must still be down.

## Initiate pre-ignition sequence.
They're getting awfully close... what the hell are they doing?

## Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force. And you are?
Jean-Luc Picard.

## Great name. French?
Yes.

## Where in the States?
Oh... here and there. You know how it is.

## Where are you from most recently?
California. San Francisco.

## That was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. How'd you do it?
It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer.

## And what were you doing out at the missile silo?
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.

## Something wrong with that?
Not yet.

## What do you want?
The invasion plans.

## These people you're calling \"Vulcans\"... who are they? Where do they come from? How many troops? What kind of weapons?
There is no invasion...

## Thank God this plate was already fixed.
What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on?

## Cochrane?
Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up.

## Did you need something?
Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.

## Did you take any other pictures of the rocket?
\"Money.\" So you can get dome money...

## You'd have to try real hard. No one's used currency in over ten years. What are you, from another planet?
No... but sometimes I feel that way. What I meant was, I'd be willing to trade for the photographs.

## Fraid not.
Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer. Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?

## What?
You're lying.

## What makes you say that?
You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.

## Were the two of you... involved?
No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.

## How did you know about that?
Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.

## All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.

## Or...?
Why are you being so difficult? All I'm asking for is to look at one of the photographs. It'll take five minutes.

## You're leaving, aren't you?
I have to...

## Why?
You've been interfering with my life ever since I met you. Don't stop now.

## Life signs?
Population... thirty-five billion... All Borg.

## Captain...?
We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line.

## Intercept course, full impulse. Weapons status?
Phasers are off-line... we have two quantum torpedoes left. But the computer targeting system has been destroyed.

## Life signs?
Can't tell. Long-range bio- sensors are off-line.

## Captain?
And if they succeed, humans won't make First Contact with the Vulcans tomorrow. As First Officer I should be the one beaming down...

## Return to our own time?
Yes, sir.

## Yes, sir. But Captain... are we... all going back?
It appears that someone has taken over the Environmental Control Room.

## What are they doing?
They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.

## Agreed. Options?
Destroy the deflector dish.

## Are you alright?
The Borg. Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship. Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.

## Do we have any idea how many Borg we're dealing with?
They're bypassing Engineering...

## Where the hell are they going?
To do what? If they wanted a weapon, they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay...

## Deflector dish... why the deflector dish...?
I remember it made me sick.

## What are you suggesting?
I think Mister Worf is suggesting that we go outside for a little stroll...

## VOICE Worf? Is something wrong?
Something is very wrong, Commander. We're falling back.

## VOICE What the hell happened down there, Worf?
Commander... we have a problem.

## Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems?
There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials.

## Even Data?
Data's positronic net contains classified information on the Enterprise. Command codes, security protocols...

## What kind of message?
Mr. President.

## I wish I knew. Uhura?
Sweet Jesus...! He's lost a lot of whatever this stuff is...

## Can you - ?
Thanks...

## What's the Brotherhood of Aliens?
Figures.

## Suppose HE'S holding a grudge?
Three months till retirement. What a way to finish.

## Bones, are you afraid of the future?
That was the general idea I intended to convey.

## Are we playing multiple choice?
Some people ARE afraid of the future; of what MIGHT happen; I was frightened, really frightened.

## Specifically of...?
More than ever.

## No way. You see this?
It's the viridium patch Spock slapped on my back right before we went aboard Gorkon's ship.

## ARE YOU CRAZY?
Damned clever if you ask me...

## Captain, when we get to Camp Khitomer, how will we defend ourselves? I mean, if this new Bird of Prey can fire while she is invisible...?
Now there's a poser.

## Captain, shall we attempt to return fire?
Too bad we can't SMELL her.

## Doctor McCoy, what is your current medical status?
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.

## Stand...?
Retire.

## Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
Barely.

## Have you saved patients as \"barely\" alive as he was?
I didn't have the knowledge of Klingon anatomy I needed.

## They'll make it look like an accident...
You say you are due for retirement. May I ask, do your hands shake?

## What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
I don't mind. Smuggling. Guilty. I come from Arc. Smuggling is an ancient and respected trade there.

## I don't wonder. Stop me if I'm wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you?
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape. We're outside the shield. Now it's your turn, Kirk.

## Would you care to go topside?
Very much.

## Take them away.
I beg your pardon?

## Isn't it a fact that you served Romulan ale, a beverage illegal in the Federation because of its overwhelming potency?
The drink WAS served...

## Did you have occasion to refer to your ship's data banks during that night?
I checked the data banks, yes.

## That isn't true...!
And what did they tell you?

## Are those your words?
Yes.

## Spoken by you?
Yes...

## You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.

## Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
I am.

## So if it should prove members of your crew did in fact carry out such an assassination - ?
As Captain I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.

## Captain, you're not going to show them the bridge?
Full diplomatic courtesy, Mr. Chekov...

## Torpedo bay! DID we fire those torpedoes?
Get close enough to a man and you can kill him on \"Stun\" without setting off the alarm - of course you can't get rid of the body...

## Where IS the conference?
She's only a cog in the wheel - no way she knows that.

## Course heading, Captain?
Second star to the right - and straight on till morning...

## What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
You tell them, Lieutenant.

## Now we go to Starfleet?
Now we expand our search to include uniforms.

## ALL uniforms?
Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe's deep in Klingon territory. If we're discovered...

## She programmed the torpedo hits?
Aye, sir.

## Mr. Valtane, any more data?
Captain, I'm getting a message from Klingon High Command.

## Do we report this, sir?
Are you kidding? Send to Starfleet Command...

## Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
We'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.

## Isn't it about time you became something else?
I like it here...

## Krandog aranty.
What took you so long?

## How did you know...?
There's a reward for your death.

## How much time's left of your sentence?
Don't you know? Everyone on Rura Penthe is here for life.

## Anything else you want to tell me?
When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.

## Getting outside the shield is easy. After that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you?
Possibly.

## Candidate for what?
Saavik, sir. We were told you'd need a helmsman - ... so I volunteered.

## Captain, may I remind you that regulations specify thrusters only while in space dock?
Aye, sir.

## Kronos, sir?
I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.

## Just the prototype.
Saavik, you know anything about a neutron energy surge?

## You hear that?
This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior.

## When does this conference start?
According to my information, today.

## Me?
There's an old Vulcan proverb, only Nixon could go to China.

## What is it?
I am uncertain.

## Where?
Curiously it appears to emanate from us.

## The peace conference.
From Enterprise?

## What peace conference?
I've been dead before. Uhura, raise Excelsior. She ought to have the co-ordinates.

## Why would they give them to us?
The Commander is an old friend of yours.

## Are you dining on worms?
You were right, it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation. You might have died.

## Close enough to beam down?
Not yet... Section 4236...

## What's she waiting for?
Probably trying to figure out why we're reversing, wondering if we detect her.

## Uhura?
Nothing, Captain. If they're here, they're rigger for silent running.

## Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
I am not certain such speculations are included among your duties, Lieutenant.

## Faith...?
That the universe will unfold as it should.

## Her own father...?
Such things have happened before, sir.

## Curious. You haven't been assisting Commander Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt?
Commander Uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir.

## A lie?
An error.

## What?
Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.

## You having hearing problems, mister?
No, sir.

## What is it?
... I cannot confirm the existence of Praxis.

## Praxis?
What's left of it.

## And if they're still in place?
Then someone forged a data bank entry.

## How do both sides overcome ingrained prejudice?
Yes, sir.

## What exactly does that mean?
It means that if we cannot have fired those torpedoes then someone else did.

## Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
I've pulled out my - uh wooden shoe and Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.

## You understand that we have lost all contact with Captain Kirk...?
At present, he's surrounded by a magnetic shield. If my calculations are correct, he should be deep into his escape planning by this time.

## Well, what about all that atmospheric equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
They might as well arrest me, too; I felt like Lieutenant Saavik.

## Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
You are me.

## Do you know where you are?
I am in a room with lights.

## Can you remember our father?
No.

## Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel?
No.

## Is that your final answer?
Brother. I cannot move.

## Why?
Because you are dangerous.

## Why?
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.

## Do you know anything about Shinzon's plans against the Federation?
No.

## No. Can I move now?
No. I must deactivate you.

## For how long?
Indefinitely.

## It'll serve you right.
How long is that?

## Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?
Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.

## When was he... created?
About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.

## Remember him?
He was a bit proud as I recall.

## Is he very much like you were?
Yes.

## Can you describe it, Deanna?
But the Romulans abandoned the plan.

## How long does he have?
I can't be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating.

## And you were particularly aware of this feeling because Commander Riker will be leaving to assume command of the Titan?
Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...

## And this makes you \"sad\"?
That is because you have a familiarity with them. You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge.

## Good work. The download?
He believes he has our communications protocols. But they will give him inaccurate locations for all Starfleet vessels.

## We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
Affirmative, sir. Negative, sir. They have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals.

## Do you think this is a wise course of action?
At our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes.

## Of you?
Yes.

## How can you be sure?
I aspire, sir. To be better than I am. The B-9 does not. Nor does Shinzon.

## It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.

## Why am I looking at me?
You are not looking at your- self. You are looking at me.

## Why?
Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.

## How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
I thought only me, myself and Lore.

## Do you have a name, sir?
I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download.

## He'd have all your memories too. You feel comfortable with that?
I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.

## It seems to be a redundant memory port. Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?
Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.

## It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics?
No, I do not mind.

## What is our approximate distance?
It appears to be... ... an arm.

## Why is it moving?
Like me, it has been designed with modular power sources.

## I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?
If you wouldn't mind.

## May I have this dance?
With pleasure, Captain.

## Do you have a moment, sir?
Of course, sit down.

## You're speaking of emotional investment?
As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.

## Is he sincere about wanting peace?
I don't know.

## How could I not?
Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.

## How can you be certain?
I know how he thinks.

## Counselor?
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle, me.

## Can you feel my hands... are they real? Can you feel my lips, my loins?
I'll always be with you now. Now and forever.

## Captain Picard, Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore. Might we be of assistance?
Your timing is impeccable, Commander.

## Do you have life support?
Do you have life support?

## It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.
Understood.

## What do we know about the planet?
Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.

## Theories?
I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.

## What do we know about the population?
Cannon fodder.

## What programs were accessed?
Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready.

## What's he doing?
He wants to look me in the eye.

## How long until he can fire?
The targeting sequence should take about four minutes.

## New Praetor?
There's more... as always. He's Reman.

## Not with the Romulans.
Not with the Romulans.

## What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
I'm preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours.

## Wont do what, Mister Worf?
Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear... Naked.

## Come now, a big, strapping fellow like you? What are you afraid of?
I'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system.

## To find the head, sir?
If you don't mind.

## Who was it?
Worf, prepare a full phaser spread, zero elevation. All banks on my mark. Scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes.

## What's this?
Your new chair, sir.

## A coup d'etat?
The Praetor's power has always been the Romulan fleet. They must be behind him.

## Why don't they answer our hails?
It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.

## Counselor?
Captain, with all due respect to diplomatic protocols -- the Federation Council's not sitting out here, we are.

## Sir?
His hatred of the Federation is apparent. He would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason. He is going after Earth.

## Strength in numbers?
We can only hope so.

## I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
Anything.

## Praetor Shinzon?
And you're not as we imagined you.

## Praetor?
I've never met a human woman.

## I am, Commander Riker... May I touch your hair?
On the world I come from there's no light. No sun. Beauty isn't important. I see now there's a world elsewhere.

## And the Senate supports you?
I have dissolved the Senate.

## Right now, youre thinking this all sounds too good to be true?
Yes.

## What happened?
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.

## You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
No race should be a slave to another.

## Were we always explorers?
No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth. It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...

## So I'm not as tall as you expected?
I always hoped I would hit two meters.

## Why am I here?
I was lonely...

## What are you doing?
I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile.

## All of this so you could capture me?
Maybe I'll train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does. Or maybe Ill snap its ugly head off.

## What's this all about?
It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...

## And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see? Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.

## My life is meaningless as long as you're alive. What am I while you exist? A shadow? An enigma?
If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation.

## Think about what you're doing, Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?
It amazes me how little you know yourself.

## Why are you here?
To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.

## And what of the Enterprise?
You know that's not possible.

## What about Picard?
Our greater goal is more important, brother.

## Should I raise shields?
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.

## Are we prepared?
A matter of hours now.

## How long until we reach the Rift?
Seven minutes.

## Join us, Commanders. Now what's the disposition of the fleet?
They're holding position.

## And?
They will obey, Praetor.

## How many Warbirds will you need?
None.

## And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?
I have a purpose.

## The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space.
Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?

## Commander Suran, the games are over. In two days the Federation will be crippled beyond repair. Does that satisfy you?
For the moment.

## It's there. The fog's thicker now, but it's there. What do you think started those fires?
Benny, there's nothing there.

## What did I tell you?
Probably kids.

## Don't you think you should call a backup?
No, we can handle this.

## Mike, call for back-up. Benny, you all right?
I don't think so...

## How much are your rooms?
Thirty-seven fifty for one person, forty-nine fifty for two.

## You have one with two beds?
Sure.

## Fill this out. Will this be cash or credit card?
Credit card.

## Do you have a good map of Death Valley?
We should have. Let me see.

## What do you do?
I make maps.

## Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?
Eh... yes.

## Make any money?
No.

## Do you have children?
No.

## What do you think of America?
Stay right there...

## What was your last stop?
Elmo's...

## Where's that?
About five miles back.

## Recognize this?
It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.

## There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure?
I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...

## Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?
Neither did I.

## Wait, wait... What are my orders if we find this thing?
Contain it and get back to me.

## Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?
We'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for.

## When can we expect containment?
Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...

## It's in a green Mustang?
Yes. It's kidnapped a woman at gunpoint and from what we can make out is forcing her to drive it somewhere.

## Why did you let it get into a populated area?
It's taken on a disguise.

## Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?
It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed...

## Is that what's affecting your performance?
You just do your job, Shermin. We'll make the policy.

## What's all this for?
We have a new directive. I'm taking over.

## What?
I just retired.

## This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, Mrs. Haydn?
I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.

## Is the man who kidnapped you there now?
I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.

## Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name again?
Marc Shermin.

## Do you know what you were kidnapped by?
Mrs. Haydn...

## Is he on his way to Lathrop Wells?
Please...

## What?
What.

## Which way?
That way.

## What?
Flashlight.

## What?
Coupons.

## What?
Pancakes.

## What?
X...

## Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... Jennyhaydn... Money?
We're going to have to stop for gas soon.

## What?
Smile.

## Smile... good?
Yes.

## What are you doing?
Minneapolis... good.

## You're full of tricks, aren't you?
No gas.

## Gas good?
Yes. Very good.

## Closed?
You'll see.

## Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am I? Who are you?
I am Jenny Haydn.

## Who are you?
I am...

## Space?
Up there... I... eh... can't explain... But that's the only place you could be from.

## Who?
My... husband.

## I am husband?
No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott.

## Shit?
No, no... don't say that. Bad word.

## Who?
Attendant. He'll give us gas. Put the gun down. Under the seat. Under the seat...

## What?
Candy.

## What is... ...Coke?
A drink.

## You want to try it?
I want to try it.

## Horses.
What's the matter?

## What?
Music.

## Why are you going here? What is here?
My... ...car will take me... ...up there... home.

## When do you have to be here?
I do not understand.

## Sun... day. No sun... night. You understand?
Yes. Day... night.

## How many days and nights do you have to go... ...here?
Three nights... two days.

## You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus... Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
No.

## Is that a baby?
Yes.

## A baby is a new person?
Eh... yes...

## Do you have a baby?
No... The closest...

## Why?
I'd love to have a baby. But I can't...

## Why?
I can't... Forget the baby. Okay? The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells. You'll have to hitchhike the rest of the way.

## I do not speak English.
What is hitchhike?

## You want this ticket?
Yes.

## The car will stop?
Not every car, but... a car will stop... Maybe not the first car... maybe number eight, number fifteen...

## When do I get to Lathrop Wells?
Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...

## Can I have the gun?
No.

## Go?
Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me... Goodbye.

## Yes?
Please stay.

## What?
It's a kiss... Goodbye...

## What happened?
I was afraid.

## Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?
It was a mistake.

## Yes?
Yes.

## Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?

## What is hell?
It's bad.

## Are you my friend?
Yes.

## Why?
I don't know.

## I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
Not all... but it feels like a kiss.

## Do you have music up there?
Yes.

## I'd like to hear it. Can you sing something?
I do not want to.

## You liked my singing?
Yes. Sing some more.

## The machine gave me two. Should I put one back?
No. Get in.

## Are you angry at me?
No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.

## I told you goodbye. Why are you here?
The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back.

## Where are you going?
I must meet my ship.

## Why can't we wait here for a ride?
The cook.

## What are you saying?
You can stop. I will go on alone.

## Why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late?
I used the last one to jump off the cliff...

## What?
Nothing.

## You don't forget anything, do you?
No.

## You don't make money gambling. You lose it.
Hello... hello. How are you this morning?

## What for?
I want to gamble.

## The cook again?
Yes.

## What will you say about us?
I will say that we can be friends.

## Would you put some of your singing in this for the baby?
You want the baby to laugh at me.

## How long will it take you to get home?
Many, many days and nights...

## Where?
The yellow one.

## Where do you think you're going?
Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.

## I love you.
What do I do now?

## I'm never going to see you again, am I?
No.

## You sure this is your car?
My grandmother's rich.

## They after you?
What? No, of course not.

## If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
Fly.

## Wait. Could I have your autograph?
Sure.

## Is it for real?
Get Fox.

## Any reports about monsters, people in Halloween masks, anything like that?
Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.

## Did your people have any contingencies rehearsed?
I know. She bought him a ticket for Lathrop Wells and put him on the bus. He didn't stay on though and they drove off together.

## You get that, Lyman?
This has always been my favorite time of day.

## Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.

## Can you see under the faceplate?
No.

## Was there visual contact?
No, sir. Radar.

## You married, Major?
Twenty-eight years.

## To the same woman?
Yes.

## It was a man though... right?
The police think he was high on drugs...

## Where are you going?
Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.

## Good job, neither do I. What do you do for a living?
I don't understand.

## Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.
Is there a reward in this?

## You saw that?
Hey... he didn't look like no big time criminal to me.

## Eh... the store tells you to call when there's trouble, so they won't get sued... But that shouldn't matter if there's a reward, right?
I wouldn't think so.

## I saw you play, man. You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying. So what happened, injuries or what?
Bullshit politics.

## Okay cash! Logical. Here's everything I have on me, what do you say? How about a Rolex?
I already got a real one. Come on, it won't be too bad. It's not personal.

## What's all this squid shit?
Superconducting QUantum Interference Device. SQUID. Got it? There's gonna be a test.

## A tragic story, no doubt. How'd you get up here?
I made my choice, Lenny.

## What're you going to do?
Watch and see.

## I don't feel anything. Is it on?
Forget it's there.

## Faith, call me, okay?
No, Lenny.

## You talked to Iris? When?
Tonight.

## I know you Faith. You're afraid of something. What's going on?
Let it alone, Lenny. It'll take care of itself.

## What? He gonna record you on his label?
Maybe.

## Max Pelcher? You're kidding?
Can't do it.

## Who did it?
Then what? Then what, Lenny?! You going to protect me? Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny. You don't even have a gun.

## What's going on?
Faith, we know about Jeriko. Iris made me a copy of the tape.

## How did it happen? What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?
We should talk alone.

## You think Tran killed her?
The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.

## You understand? Attorney! Right? Am I right?
That's right.

## What kind of things exactly?
Exactly anything. Whatever you want. Whoever you want to be. Fabri, get us another round, would you.

## What? Right Here?
Step into my office.

## Thanks, Max.
Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public?

## D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.

## Hey, Iris, you okay?
See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.

## You should feel like shit.
An ex-cop that doesn't carry. It's embarrassing. I oughta not be seen with you. Hey, Mace. What's goin' on?

## I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time. Do us both good. Right?
Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you. Hey, at least you got a job! Watch her for me. Stay on her.

## You alright? Y'okay?
He stalks her. He rapes her. Then he does her...

## Why me?
Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed.

## Faith OK?
No. But his frontal lobes are like two runny eggs. They put an amplifier in-line to boost the signal till it french-fried his brain.

## Whattya mean?
All I'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes. I've heard stuff.

## What stuff?
Jesus.

## Okay... what about Strickland?
No. Bad idea.

## What do you mean?
Give him the tape. See? It's fucking brilliant! The tape for Faith. I know he'll go for it. I can set it up.

## This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
2-2-0-3. Got it. Stay on her.

## Where's Faith?
I sent her to the party. I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.

## What makes you think I'm gonna kill Tran?
You just did.

## Wait a minute. Now I'm remembering. I killed Iris too, didn't I?
That's right. They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment. The one I left for you at the club was a copy.

## You bet. Did you like it?
Picture it... I feel like I gotta share this with somebody. It's too perfect.

## How did you hook up with Faith?
Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.

## How'd you get the tape? Why didn't the cops put it in evidence?
With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig. Guy had it under a wig.

## Yeah, but how'd it get to you?
Fuck that! The last part's the best. You dry-dive six stories and blammo! Jack right into the Big Black.

## What else you got?
Whoa. That is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck.

## What?
Well, it's cutting awful close to me. I mean she was just here.

## Who was just here?
Iris, man. Pay attention.

## She never gave me a tape.
What clip? What was it?

## You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny? For old time's sake? Make a couple bucks for the holidays?
You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.

## That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?
Charm.

## Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
I was invited here by a close friend, Mr. Fumitsu, see he's right over there.

## Your sex life?
Your existence.

## Excuse me. What part of NO don't you understand?
Mace, you're my friend. I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight.

## So, what's up with you? Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.

## What's his name?
Fumitsu.

## What the fuck are you doing?
Coming with you.

## Are we having a bad night?
Let's talk in the car.

## Hey, careful on the jacket. This is Armani. You angry?
I've had enough of this shit. You're on foot, Lenny.

## In LA? Are you crazy?
I need my case. It's still in the back.

## Okay, you got my attention, but this is cutting off the circulation to my head, here. D'you mind?
I thought we were friends.

## You still like me, don't you? We're still buddies?
Yeah. I don't see a way out of it.

## Who's the new side of beef in Tran's posse?
Guy named Wade Beemer. Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97.

## Rams... that's football, right?
Forget her.

## What's that? Present from Faith?
No idea.

## My God, Lenny. What is it?
Black. Jack.

## Are you sure it's real?
Never really thought about it.

## Because it had to look random. Not connected to anything or anyone. But then why give the rape to me?
That's where it gets a little strange.

## And what about the guy that was following me?
Now you're really getting paranoid.

## The question is not whether I am paranoid, but whether I am paranoid enough. You want to rub my neck?
Sure.

## How's Zander?
OK. He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him.

## Where we going?
Anywhere. We'll talk about it in the car.

## You better keep a low profile for a while.
What is it?

## Lenny, have you lost it completely?
Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.

## Bullet resistant? Whatever happened to bullet proof?
I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape.

## You sure?
It's the walk. Something. Anyway, they'll run your plates and get your address. We gotta keep moving.

## Hang on. Hang on, Max. You see?
I see. I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.

## Yeah I know. So what do we do?
We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance.

## There's a plus side?
Yeah. You gave up your hot tub tape to save me. That's real progress for you.

## Why?
He's totally cut off from the outer world.

## Who's Strickland?
Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch.

## And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them. Did it?
No. It didn't.

## Got your ticket?
No. They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.

## You see Tran?
Uh unh.

## And do what? Take on his whole posse?
I still got one ace to play. Tran's got what I want... and I've got what he wants...

## Oh boy. What if you're wrong?
Then we'll be right where we are now.

## Are we under arrest?
Naw. They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.

## Where were you Mom? Did you meet a guy?
Just Lenny.

## What is that?
Sucks. Hey, Bobby, turn that up.

## Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?
Yup. He was Jeriko's manager. Bummer, Tran! Lost your golden goose. Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

## Maybe he just figures Lenny will appreciate what he's created. It's the dark end of the street, Lenny. How do you like it now?
Um... he was older.

## Testa?
No.

## Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory?
Of course. He knows everything about Dick Low.

## Takes four days to chill, then its time to come back. Is that...?
Yeah.

## Agents Duncan, Mackelway. Anything new?
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.

## Anybody talk to the press?
No, sir.

## You run the plates?
Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.

## Where's the Nuevo American Diner?
Ten miles back on the Texas side.

## Nine bodies in Roswell, now this -- it's getting a little hairy, huh?
I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.

## You're thinking...?
Who knows.

## This isn't in our database?
I just assumed she ran away. Happens a lot around here. Look around. This place is an invitation to run away.

## What's the bad news?
You tell me.

## What does the Manager say?
I sent a female in. The room in question was rented by an Anglo, cash; since then, nothing -- no activity, no phone response.

## And it's getting dark. I'm not going to run this into the night. Eddie, we're walking in. Everything covered?
Show's over, boys. Nobody home.

## Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
Hi there.

## What?
Her body turned up. In a Minnesota cemetery. They brought her back.

## You have the body?
She's buried.

## I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
Winona.

## I appreciate it, doctor. You know how it is, press screaming for answers, Washington's all over me. Ever handle a serial case?
Be my guest, Agent Kulok, scrub suits are in the back.

## Hi. What's in the case?
You... surprised me.

## Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around. Whatja sell?
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.

## You must travel a lot, huh?
Yeah.

## Whole country or just hereabouts?
I don't mean to be rude, but...

## What?
About your being away all the time. Must get lonely.

## Fucking. I'm talking about fucking, Harold. You ever think of fucking other women?
Look, mister...

## Take a look, Harold. Tell me if you see anything you want. You do like to look, don't you?
My God.

## Not bad, huh?
You're a... you're sick.

## What's wrong with me?
Calm down, Harold. Okay, here's what we're going to do, Harold, there's a pull off up ahead, we're going to stop there.

## What do you want from me?
I've been looking for you.

## The man who was with him, he was a construction worker?
Yes.

## What did he look like?
I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, white, regular build, needed a shave -- that's all I remember.

## How did you know he was a construction worker?
He had an orange hat on.

## He was sitting here?
It's been wiped down a hundred times since then.

## What kind?
An old junker. Like a reservation car. Blue, side door with brown, you know, primer paint. New Mexico plates. A Ford or ah, yeah, a Ford.

## What about his killer?
Nada. Vague description, that's all. Fine-tooth-combed Speck's car, the diner, no fingerprints, no trace evidence.

## You have the photo from the diner?
At the field office.

## He said it was a clue?
Maybe something to do with Zorro.

## We didn't know Speck was a serial, the police didn't know, his wife didn't know -- so how did the killer know?
Maybe cause he's smart.

## What?
We have another one.

## Another what?
Serial killer killed. In Ft. Myers. Cut up in his van. And this time we got a witness.

## What are you doing?
Please.

## Who?
Speck. Harold Speck.

## From the grave?
MyDick.

## He got away. I had him. He got away.
Then why do I still have a badge?

## The cut on your arm -- mind if we remove the bandage?
Go ahead.

## If my Reporting Agent could be someone outside Computer Crimes, perhaps Agent Kulok?
I'll take it into consideration.

## I always meant to ask, what is it that makes you so special? Why is it you have this special rapport with multiple killers? Why you?
They like my stories. They like the way I think. They're into fantasy. I turn them on.

## You feeling okay, Agent Mackelway?
Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.

## Okay, Harold Speck, who goes first?
Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well, nothing.

## How long ago?
You knew the arm slash was not \"Zorro.\"

## What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
I got a look in Testa's computer. His screen name was \"Imelda.\" Have to give him that, had a sense of humor.

## Collected shoes too?
We're waiting for trace evidence results on the Rice killing.

## How do you send out an APB on a dead man?
Huh?, sir.

## Why did you go to Chicago?
I was visiting an old college friend.

## You didn't tell anyone where you were?
An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.

## Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.

## What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?
Thank you, Rangers. Put this man in the unmarked.

## You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
The Academy, then CIIAC.

## How long have you been downtown?
Five months. I love it.

## You work with Koessler?
Not especially.

## Beats me. He just asked me to come along, double-check the forensics. What did you do to piss him off?
This is a sexy case.

## What about the chat rooms themselves?
That's part of the reason I dropped by. I need to learn this stuff.

## They're all criminals?
\"Gone live?\"

## Taking a Stryker saw, cutting off the top of someone's cranium, pulling the brain out -- what's that, a day in Spring?
You got a point there.

## What's that?
Sex.

## Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
He thinks he looks young.

## What's this country coming to?
My guess, he's wondering whether to get more fries or go straight to the chocolate sundae.

## Me too. Make any headway with \"Zorro\"?
None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.

## That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
He's a consultant to a network TV program on Profilers. He gets a check every episode.

## Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most, that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.

## Why did Koessler assign you as my liaison?
Because you asked him to, stupid.

## Does Koessler ask about me?
He's called a couple times.

## What did you tell him?
Just routine stuff.

## Not about coming to see Daitz?
Not yet. Not about this, either.

## We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?
Sue Ann Hanson.

## Did they disconnect Testa's computer?
Not yet. This time they're waiting for you.

## What's that?
You need time to think. About the case, about you and me.

## And nobody else can do that?
Not the way I can.

## Jaime? Where are you?
Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.

## What's up?
I'm in Omaha. Get to the airport. There's been another one.

## Start killing people for real?
Suspect Zero.

## What's going on?
Slow down a second, you met with Low --

## And you're working with him?
I need something tangible. To hook him. I told him I'd found the confidential file on the Suspect Zero theory.

## Does one exist?
Probably. I told him Koessler had ordered the report, kept it secret.

## Koessler doesn't know any of this?
I've decided to investigate Low's plane crash. While I'm at it, I thought I'd look at the cases Koessler worked with Low.

## Jaime, do you think, when this is all over, when we're in different divisions, you think maybe you and me, we could try again?
Mack, I'm just trying to keep up with now.

## But why this pattern?
Could be a lot of things. Depends on the freezer. I'm sorry, Mack, but I don't think this is the answer.

## Tom, you okay?
Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody calls me Mack. I always liked that.

## You okay?
Yeah, of course.

## What's going on?
It's quite advanced.

## All the same killer?
Low calls him Suspect Zero.

## What happened?
I'm going to Amarillo.

## Agent Kulok, could you wipe my face?
Unlock these cuffs.

## Uncuff me. What's wrong with you? Don't you want to save the boy?
I want to protect the boy. I also want to protect Suspect Zero -- from you.

## How did you know Speck was a killer?
The little piggie speaks.

## Who are you?
I'll give you a little hint. You're a smart guy, figure it out.

## Agent Mackelway?
Yes.

## How's the arm?
I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.

## He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?
He's moved on to TV.

## What was your weakness, sir?
I'm not sure, exactly. I had monsters on the brain. I wanted to get these guys, every one of them. I got obsessive.

## So you went underground?
I don't carry it with me.

## Of course not. They're possibles. I've checked them against Bureau records, check them against your file. How did you get it?
Daitz hinted it existed. It was a matter of forming the request in the proper terms.

## How do you know who's real and who's not?
And who else did I find? Agent Thomas Mackelway, crackerjack FBI techie. I was greatly disappointed when you were re-assigned.

## You knew it was me all along?
I already have an employer.

## Who told you about her?
You did. You were with her when she disappeared, right? She took you to the mall or the movies, you turn around and she's gone.

## You? You went by the book?
Yeah, problem was, I had the only copy. See ya.

## Is he dead?
Yeah.

## Was it Zero?
Yeah.

## So you're the new meat?
Yes, sir.

## What did you do to end up here?
I believe it's in my file, sir.

## Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
Thomas Mackelway.

## Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.

## I see that. Washington to Philadelphia to here. Philly's a nice station. How many agents?
Four hundred and sixty, sir.

## \"Attitude Adjustment Issues\" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.

## Agent Mackelway, you want to get off your ass and do something for a change?
Yes, sir.

## Koessler?
The same.

## But why attack an Agent?
He wants us to know he's out there, what he's doing. It's not enough just to kill somebody like Speck, he wants us to know he did it.

## How far is Amarillo?
350 miles.

## Now, Mr. Hawkins, when last in Amarillo, where did you get gas?
Locate a jet, we're going to Amarillo.

## Excuse me, Agent Mackelway?
This man, Hawkins, has killed dozens of people. Suspect Zero.

## What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.

## You want to \"profile\" me? Find out what makes me \"tick\"? Write about me, go on a talk show, give me a nickname?
It's over for you.

## Are you calling Her?
No. Stop, come on.

## Do you realize that I've been waiting for that call for six months and I cut her off?
You're money, baby.

## What kind of car do you drive?
Oh... a Cavalier.

## You like laughing at the misery of others?
I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. Let me make it up to you.

## You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
...maybe...

## You're a comedian?
Yeah.

## What's that like?
I know! Starbucks! I served you an espresso at Starbucks.

## Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago.

## Well, thank you...?
Nikki.

## Like the quiche?
Yes. Like the quiche.

## Why? You're not a real man?
Not lately.

## Just like that?
Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah.

## How was it hard?
Well, I left someone very special behind.

## You too?
Yeah.

## How?
Well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single.

## What else?
What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.

## To do what?
I don't know... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want.

## Anything?
Anything.

## Like if I meet a handsome young man and I wanted to ask him to dance? I can do that?
Uh, if the guy wants to.

## You don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?
Maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's what he's afraid of.

## Charles! What's up, man?
Oh. You know.

## Did you, um, did you get that pilot?
No, man. I know you didn't get it 'cause you wouldn't've asked me. It wasn't that funny anyway...

## What else is going on?
Why don't I just wait three weeks and tell her I was cleaning out my wallet and found her number...

## Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?
I haven't heard an official \"no\" yet.

## You haven't told then, huh?
No.

## ...Four days..?
I know what you're saying, man. I don't know what to tell you...

## They were auditioning for the same role as you?
It's like, you looked at my tape. You saw my picture. Why did you call me in? You knew I was twenty-four.

## The poor thing. Six years?
...And she's with someone else.

## He's so sweet. He really said that?
I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.

## Could you believe it?
Wait here, I'll get you that martini.

## What do you guys do?
I'm a comedian.

## Sorry?
You have to lay it on the table.

## Huh?
You want this in black chips.

## Do you have anything smaller?
Yes, but I'm afraid this table has a hundred-dollar-minimum bet. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable at one of our lower stakes tables.

## Why not?
There are different circuits... it's hard to explain... you wouldn't understand...

## Who's your booking agent?
Oh? You know about booking agents... I don't, uh, actually have a west coast agent as of yet...

## Well, who represents you back east?
Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...

## What do you do, Trent?
I'm sure she'll call. Six years is a long time. You don't just break it off cleanly after six years.

## Why not?
It's a rebound.

## Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
Six years.

## You're a comedian?
Yeah. And an actor.

## Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into...

## Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from \"You Bet Your Life\", right?
Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.

## Can I give you a ride to your car...?
...Nah. I'm right across the street...

## ...Which one...?
...The red piece of shit over there...

## Are you on the other line?
Yeah, hold on.

## Fine... I guess. You?
Good. I think about things.

## Yeah?
Yeah.

## What kind of things?
You know, us.

## Really?
I miss you, Mike.

## Why didn't you call?
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...

## Pierre... That's his name? Pierre? Is he French?
Hi.

## I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
I really want to catch up with you, but I've gotta take this call. They're holding. I'll talk with you when you get back in town. Bye.

## And what if I don't want to give up on her?
You don't call.

## So what's the difference?
So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her.

## Right... Wait, what do you mean?
I didn't want to say anything.

## Why?
I don't know. It's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter.

## What? Like, you didn't want to jinx it?
Kinda.

## Oh no?
I didn't mention her once today.

## You want to hit the town tonight?
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.

## What do you have? A Pluto call back?
Sure. Kick me when I'm down.

## How many strokes?
I don't know. Eight or Nine.

## What'd you get?
An eight.

## So, if the party starts at eight, why are we first going to a bar at ten?
To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven.

## Oh. Where is this place?
It's one of these. For some reason, cool bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front.

## Kinda money, huh?
Classy.

## What's that guy's name? Sue?
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.

## Him?
There are so many beautiful women here.

## I'm going in. Will you be my wing- man?
I'll be your winger.

## You haven't been drinking, have you?
No. Just O.J.

## What's the point?
It's been two days. You should call that girl Nikki...

## What's dumb about it?
Well, you're doing so well...

## They turned you down?
They went for someone with more theme park experience. I woulda killed for that job.

## You miss the pain?
...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.

## Wow. You wanna grab a bite?
Sure.

## What's he do?
He's trying to be an actor.

## Who threw this party, anyway?
Damned if I know...

## How's it going for you two?
Not well.

## Rejected?
Big butt... you know, can't fly coach.

## You asshole. Why are you carrying a gun? What? In case someone steps to you, Snoop Dogg?
But most important, man, I'm sorry about what I said. I was drunk... My adrenaline was going...

## Believe me, I know what that's like. Yo, Double Down! What time are we leaving?
Good for you, man. He's being smart.

## Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
Don't call me ever again.

## Coffee... Two coffees. It says \"Breakfast Any Time\", right?
That's right.

## S'up Trent?
Lemme get off the other line, baby.

## What are you talking about? Vegas?
VEGAS.

## What Vegas?
We're going to Vegas.

## When?
Tonight, baby.

## What?
What are you wearing? I mean, we should wear suits.

## That's not cool.
Whu?

## Did she, or did she not smile?
It doesn't matter...

## What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around.

## You think they're watching?
Oh, they're watching all right. They're watching.

## What?!?
Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven.

## But I lost! How can you say always?!?
...Well, you know, not counting the first table.

## Yea, how much?
I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.

## Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
Twenty... but I was down at least fifty. I'm sorry, I got hot at the crap table.

## Who's the big winner?
Mikey's the big winner.

## What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?
I know she's coming back.

## You think so?
You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.

## Stop. Ladies, don't you double down on an eleven?
Whatever.

## What was the part?
Oh... \"I love you... I can't believe you're doing this... Drugs are bad...\" Whatever. After-School bullshit. The role is Brother.

## \"Big Brother\", \"Little Brother\"?
No, man. I need to use the phone.

## What?
I gotta use the phone.

## She asked me what I was thinking about? What should I have done? Lie?
You didn't have to get into it, baby.

## I don't know. The whole Judy Garland thing kind of turned me on. Does that makes me some kind of fag?
No, baby. You're money.

## How?
I just need some time...

## ...Whatever. It's work. You're doing what you love. What's she doing?
Selling scrap metal.

## See? And what does this guy she's with do?
He drives a carriage.

## What?!?
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.

## Please. And you're sweating him? You're \"all that\" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
I hear she's getting real fat.

## No. Doesn't that suck?
What? That was the best part of the old game.

## What time's this party tonight?
It starts at eight...

## Who? Rob?
Yeah. You met him once.

## How you guys doing?
It's on.

## Which one?
Minnie Pearl.

## What?
You looked right at her, baby.

## Was I money?
I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.

## Why, baby? What'd I do wrong?
You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.

## How long do I wait to call?
A day.

## Tomorrow?
No...

## So, two days?
Yeah. I guess you could call it that.

## What the fuck..?
What an asshole. Didn't you see \"Boys in the Hood\"? Now one of us is gonna get shot.

## You were off your ass back there! Where the hell did you learn to do all that twirly whirly shit?
I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. That Lorraine chick is good.

## You were good. Did you see how she was vibing you?
What a surprise...

## Is she looking at me, baby?
No.

## Now?
No.

## Is she looking now?
No! She's not looking at you. She hasn't looked at you once. Will you stop asking if... Wait, she just looked.

## See, baby?
Yes she did.

## What was cold about it?
It's on.

## You think?
Baby, I know it is. It's a black diamond trail...

## ...I used to wait two days. Now everyone waits two days. Three days is kinda money now, don't you think?
...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...

## Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
...Shut up, Sue...

## Beautiful. What time are you off... ...Christy?
Six.

## And you?
I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.

## The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
No. You ask for too much.

## What do you wish me to do?
I want you to use all your powers, all your skill, as you love me. I do not want his mother to see him as he is.

## I swear I'm innocent. I swear on the head of my children, I'm innocent. Mike, don't do this to me, please Mike, don't do this to me!
You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people. That little farce you played out with my sister. Did Barzini kid you that would fool a Corleone?

## What's the matter, Carlo?
Shut up.

## You're staying home. You're not going out.
What was that?

## OK, OK. You gonna make me something to eat at least?
The food is on the table.

## You heard about your father?
Yeah.

## Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.

## How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is. Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.

## That's all? Don't you want me to send some people over here?
No, just you and Paulie.

## Clemenza. You take care of Paulie. I don't ever want to see him again. Understood?
Understood.

## You take care of Paulie?
You won't see Paulie anymore. He's sick for good this winter.

## How bad will it be?
We gotta fight sometime. Let us at least recruit our regimes to full strength.

## Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
Maybe less...

## You think we'll go for that last place?
Maybe, or you gotta know now.

## What percentages for my family?
Thirty per cent. In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.

## And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family?
My compliments. I'll take care of them from my share.

## So. I receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection. No worries about operations, is that what you tell me?
If you think two million dollars in cash is just finance, I congratulate you Don Corleone.

## Are you worried about security for your million?
No.

## Can I do something for you still? You're not too rich, or too famous that I can't help you?
I'm not rich anymore, Godfather, and...my career, I'm almost washed up...

## You take care of your family?
Sure.

## Is it necessary?
You understand him better than anyone.

## When did he call?
This morning.

## No, give him a living. But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom?
I've called the hospital; they've notified Consiglere Genco's family to come and wait. He won't last out the night.

## What is this nonsense?
It's from Johnny. It was announced this morning. He's going to play the lead in the new Woltz Brothers film.

## When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean?
Mention it, don't insist. Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.

## He was the one behind Sollozzo?
Tattaglia is a pimp. He could never have outfought Santino. But I wasn't sure until this day. No, it was Barzini all along.

## Will your girl friend get back to the city all right?
Tom said he'd take care of it.

## What was this for?
For bravery.

## And this?
For killing a man.

## And now, what do you choose to do?
I'm going to finish school.

## Have you thought about a wife? A family?
No.

## Then why have I become a man like you?
A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that.

## What else do you believe in?
I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.

## How did you find out?
I see you have your Luca Brasi.

## How?
He will get in touch with you through someone you absolutely trust. That person will arrange a meeting, guarantee your safety...

## Your wife and children...you're happy with them?
Yes.

## Where are you going?
Corleone.

## Is that why there are more men on the walls?
Even so, I don't think it is safe here anymore. I've made plans to move you to a villa near Siracuse. You must go right away.

## What is it?
Bad news from America. Your brother, Santino. He has been killed.

## How do you know I come from America?
We hear. We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.

## Hey America! Is she as rich as they say?
Yes.

## Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen. Is your wife coming with you?
And hair. Black and curly, like a doll. And such a mouth.

## Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the airport?
He had business at the hotel, but he'll drop in for dinner.

## Ever seen anything like that before?
No.

## Who are those girls?
That's for you to find out.

## Is the hospital covered?
The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time. What about the hit list.

## Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
No, and I've been calling all night. Maybe he's shacked up.

## Tom, you're the Consigliere, what do we do if the old man dies?
That's easy to say; it's not your father.

## Was there a definite proposal?
Sure, he wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition. The promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse.

## What about that Tattaglias? What will they do about Bruno?
Part of the deal, Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.

## No no, no more advice on how to patch it up Tom. You just help me win. Understood?
McCluskey can't stay with the Turk forever. We'll wait.

## One of Tattaglia's people?
No. Our informer in McCluskey's precinct. Tonight at 8,00 he signed out for Louis' Restaurant in the Bronx. Anyone know it.

## Can you do it Mike?
Pop, they hit us and we hit them back.

## What was that?
An accident. No one was hurt.

## Listen Tom, I let my cab go; can I come in to call another one?
Will you give this to him.

## Sure. Anything I can do for you.
He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first. Understood?

## No. I guess I'll see you Christmas. Everyone's going to be out at Long Beach, right?
Right.

## What about McCluskey?
Let's say now that we have to kill McCluskey. We'll clear that up through our Newspaper contacts later.

## Mike, why are you cutting me out of the action?
Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man. What could be more important than that.

## Mike, why am I out?
You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.

## How will they come at you?
I know now. I'll make them call me Don.

## Have you agreed on a meeting?
A week from tonight. In Brooklyn on Tessio's ground, where I'll be safe.

## Michael, what are those men doing?
They're waiting to see my father.

## Why do they bother him on a day like this?
Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day.

## You really want to know?
Yes. Tell me.

## You like spaghetti?
You know I love spaghetti.

## If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?
My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid, so my father took him in. He's a good lawyer.

## And what do you want for Christmas?
Just you.

## What will your father say?
As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object. He'll be hurt, but he won't object.

## What time do they expect us?
For dinner. Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.

## Michael, what are you doing?
Shhh, you be the long distance operator. Here.

## Would you like me better if I were a nun?
No.

## Michael?
I'm thinking about it.

## How is your father?
He'll be OK.

## Huh?
Tell me you love me.

## Look. I'll see you tonight, OK?
OK.

## Can I go to the hospital with you?
I don't think so. You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.

## When will I see you again?
I want you to go back to New Hampshire...think things over.

## When will I see you again?
Goodbye.

## Don't you want dinner first?
No, you eat...don't wait up for me.

## Wake me up when you come to bed?
Your sister wants to ask you something.

## Let me think about it, O.K.?
Michael, it's not true. Please tell me.

## I'm Michael Corleone--this is my father. What happened to the detectives who were guarding him?
You just stand here one minute...

## How's Mom?
I can help you out...

## What?
One of them fingered the old man.

## Is it going to be all-out war, like last time?
Until the old man tells me different.

## Where are you going?
To the city.

## What are you, inspecting the barracks? You ready? Did Clemenza tell you be sure to drop the gun right away?
A million times.

## O.K. How long do you think before I can come back?
Probably a year...

## We're going to New Jersey?
Maybe.

## Do you pledge to guide and protect this child if he is left fatherless? Do you promise to shield him against the wickedness of the world?
Yes, I promise.

## And all his works?
I do renounce them.

## Do you wish to be baptized?
I do wish to be baptized.

## He talked to you?
I can arrange security.

## Mike, good to see you. Got everything you want?
Thanks.

## Is my credit good enough to buy you out?
Buy me out?...

## You think I scam?
Hell, he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time. Players couldn't get a drink.

## I think so. Detective squad?
Right. Don't say my name, just listen. Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago.

## Is he alive?
I think so, but I can't get close enough. There's a lot of blood. I'll try to find out more.

## You should come and have lunch with us, before you go -- Dickie?
Sure. Any time.

## We?
Yes, Tom Ripley's here.

## I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.
Is that good?

## What? What?
Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf 1st.

## Did you speak to my father?
Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a club, it's not a club, it's a cellar.

## You'd say if you mind?
No, I like him.

## Oh darling -- is that for me?
No it's for Tom as he didn't complain.

## Who's this?
It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.

## Okay. And did we know each other?
Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me.

## Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog. This is Marge Sherwood. Tom -- sorry, what was it?
Ripley. Hullo. How do you do.

## Say again?
You know, a primer.

## Can you mix a martini?
Sure.

## What? What's this?
I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them.

## I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
I'd pay you. If you would go to Italy and persuade my son to come home. I'd pay you $1000.

## You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?
Your parents met her.

## I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?
You're doing great. We'll make a sailor of you yet. You're doing really well.

## Could we sail to Venice?
Sure. I love Venice.

## I could fuck this icebox I love it so much. What were you actually doing in New York?
I played piano in a few places.

## Well we certainly know that's true.
I love the fact you brought Shakespeare with you and no clothes. Ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night. Is that true?

## Do you have any brothers?
No, no brothers, no sisters.

## Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune anyway.
Me neither. Nor does Marge. All only children -- what does that mean?

## What does he say?
He's getting impatient. He wants me to reassure him you'll be home by Thanksgiving.

## Where do we find a carozza for the Forum, or can we hire any of them -- ?
Relax.

## Freddie?
Freddie Miles. You know -- he's organizing the Cortina skiing trip.

## Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum...?
I did. And then maybe get the jacket and what have you...

## Shoes too?
You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.

## Get undressed in your own room, would you?
I thought you'd missed the train.

## Is Freddie here?
He's downstairs.

## She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do you know what that means in a place like this?
I'm prepared to take the blame.

## What are you talking about?
You've been so good to me. You're the brother I never had. I'm the brother you never had.

## What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least?
To Mongibello and the happiest days of my life.

## Why?
Then I'll take it as a compliment.

## What?
So cool.

## Marge and I are getting married.
Really? To Italy?

## How?
Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd.

## What?
You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.

## Do you think you can steer this thing?
Sure.

## What are you doing?
Marge-maintenance.

## Who is it?
It's Freddie. Let me in.

## Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?
I guess.

## What about Christmas?
He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't get a cable or a call or a note or, frankly, a fart.

## Hardly.
How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?

## Freddie, do you have something to say?
What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity -- or to something else.

## Yes. What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo?
I'll try my best, sir. Obviously I'll do anything to help Dickie.

## Hello, sir. Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up?
Marge has been telling us about the rings.

## San Remo. The police are amateurs. Well, my boy, it's come to a pretty pass, hasn't it?
This theory, the letter he left for you, the Police think that's a clear indication he was planning on doing something... to himself.

## Is Mr Greenleaf here?
Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.

## I could probably see my bedroom from here. I can see my house. When you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream, isn't it?
I don't care for B.S. I don't care to hear it. I don't care to speak it.

## Why do you think Dickie's father sent him to Europe in the first place? Did you know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half-killed a boy?
I hope she never knows.

## What's going on?
You were right about the telephones. There are no lines, there's some problem.

## Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
Back, I suppose, slowly as I can.

## Frances?
My fiance.

## Are you okay?
Sure.

## What about Cortina?
Didn't Dick say? -- He talked to Freddie... apparently it's not going to work out -- Freddie says there aren't enough rooms.

## How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.

## Where's Dickie?
I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days.

## Ha. Did he say why?
I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.

## What does that mean?
Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.

## Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
He was thinking of you, Marge -- he asked me to deliver this.

## How long's he staying for?
Search me. I guess we're abandoned.

## Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
No. Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.

## Is he really not here?
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.

## I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you. What happened to your face?
Dickie did it.

## What?
Get on. I'll take you to him.

## He's American. He's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day before he disappeared.
Where does Dickie live?

## Look at me what?
To the manner born.

## Did Dickie's Dad go?
He's having an early night.

## Tom?
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.

## What?
I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.

## Why do you have Dickie's rings?
I told you. He gave them to me.

## Why? When?
I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you.

## What?
I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.

## Dickie? Do you know Dickie?
You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.

## How would you know that?
Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about you, of course -- from Marge, and Dickie.

## Do you know Tom?
We think he's had a change of heart. So we should be celebrating.

## Where's Dickie's father?
He's not coming till the morning. Evidently his stomach -- I don't think the food here is agreeing with him.

## Golly. Who's paying for this?
This is spectacular.

## What's funny?
No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when Tom arrived in Mongi. And now look at you.

## Excuse me?
No, it's just -- you are American, aren't you? -- no, I just, I have so much luggage, and you're so, uh, streamlined. It's humiliating.

## You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?
Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.

## Which is?
Emily. Just kidding.

## As in the...?
As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mother's name, too.

## How did you know that?
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.

## Is Freddie in Rome?
I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So the rat's here now, in Rome.

## I thought you were enjoying yourself?
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.

## Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.
I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?

## Just kidding. Are you alone?
Hardly. I couldn't be less alone.

## When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding?
I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer.

## So -- are you travelling under R?
You know what -- I am.

## All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?
He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside.

## Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?
Are you a homosexual? Interesting non-sequitur.

## Where are you hiding him? He's impossible, isn't he?
Yes, what happened? I heard you were desperate to come. I was looking forward to rowing you around.

## Well hurry, before we sink. Should I give you my telephone number in Venice?
Thanks.

## Will we see you later?
I can't later.

## Ten thirty?
We'll be there.

## What rumour?
That Dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport. I know, ridiculous.

## Il signor Ripley ha una fidanzata, il signor Dickie ha una fidanzata e probabilmente il signor Freddie Miles ha molte fidanzate.
What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome?

## What did he say?
He says so many fiances.

## Just because he doesn't like Americans!
But you're still tormented, you must be, you've killed somebody...

## No key, huh?
I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep.

## You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?
Not guilty.

## Are you okay?
I'm fine.

## Do you want me to stick around?
It's okay.

## Tom, are you okay?
You try. You try talking to her.

## Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
I give up.

## What do you want to change about this moment?
Nothing.

## Hello. What are you up to?
All kinds of things. Making plans.

## Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
I don't know. Both. My plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset. Come with me.

## How was it?
Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.

## Was who Meredith?
Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith.

## Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?
Or Tom and Peter even.

## What do you mean lied about who you are?
I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.

## I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks. I've suffered all day. Who found him?
Senta. We have to ask you to stay in Rome.

## Postmortem?
Yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening.

## Of course. What happened to your face?
My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by photographers.

## The telephone, the press, I've been, I'm feeling hounded -- do you think you could not give out my address?
Never. We've had many requests and, of course, we say no -- even to your fiance.

## Even your fiance...?
Even her.

## What about Ripley?
Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That was months ago.

## Was it? Did you speak to Tom?
November 7th is my information.

## And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
A few days ago.

## Thank you.
Does he stay with you here?

## Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley?
I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.

## You got a .44 Magnum?
That's an expensive gun.

## How much to get a permit to carry?
Nah, this'll be fine.

## Is there a firing range around?
Sure, here, take this card, go to this place and give 'em the card. They'll charge you, but there won't be any hassle.

## Huh?
Vietnam? I saw it on your jacket. Where were you? Bet you got to handle a lot of weapons out there.

## Huh?
I can get you front and center. What do you like? I can get you Mets, Knicks, Rangers? Hell, I can get you the Mayor's box.

## Who mam?
Charles Palantine. The man you want to volunteer to help elect president.

## You want to canvass?
Yes, mam.

## Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
If you don't mind, mam, I'd be mighty pleased if you'd go out and have some coffee and pie with me.

## Why?
I don't know...

## Yes?
My name is Travis.

## Where do you live?
Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.

## So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
After this job, I'm looking forward to being alone for a while.

## What kind of people?
Just people people, you know. Just people. Had a dead man once.

## Really?
He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said \"West 45th Street\" and conked out.

## What did you do?
I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.

## The moon?
The full moon. One night I had three or four weirdos in a row and I looked up and, sure enough, there it was -- the full moon.

## Huh?
Late one night. About three. At the plaza.

## The DMZ?
That would have been quite a coincidence.

## What hours do you work?
I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.

## What?
That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said \"Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction\".

## The singer?
Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too much.

## Travis, you haven't even played the record?
Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.

## So you haven't heard this record yet?
No. I thought maybe you could play it for me on your player.

## What are you doing?
I bought a couple of tickets.

## What's wrong?
I forgot to get the Coca-Cola.

## Where are you going?
I'm leaving.

## What do you mean?
These are not the kind of movies I go to.

## You mean these are the only kind of movies you go to?
This is sort of high class...

## Huh?
It's very simple. You go your way, I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis.

## What about the record?
Keep it.

## Can I call you?
Hello, Travis.

## Travis?
Yeah.

## Maybe I'll see you again sometime, huh?
Sure.

## The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.

## Just didn't get around to it, huh?
Oh, Tom, please.

## Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
More people watch it.

## Just what?
Kidding around... you know, fun.

## Sure we could run him. You realize he's already head of his block association.
Well, if Cronkite's so great, why don't we run him instead?

## What taxi driver?
That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here.

## How long has he been there?
I don't know -- but it feels like a long time.

## This is gotta be a game, right?
As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed them.

## With the other hand, right?
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.

## Now look more closely. Look around the eyes and chin. See? See there?
What is your name? My name is Travis.

## Ya want me to call da boss? Huh? That what you want?
We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.

## Threw on the emergency, jumped the seat and fucked her brains out -- What do you think! What do I have to do? Draw you a picture?
Yeah.

## And what happened?
She stayed in the cab, what's she gonna do? But she stiffed me. A real skunk.

## You run all over town, don't you, Travis?
Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.

## What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
Support my kids. Can you dig it? Nice to meet ya, Travis. So long, Wizard. Say hello to Malcolm X for me.

## One-Ball McCall?
Fuckin' One-Ball.

## Stick up?
No, just some crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.

## I mean, you handle some pretty rough traffic, huh?
I have.

## You carry a piece? You need one?
Nah. I suppose not.

## 20 bucks?
Yeah. Hey thanks. That's real nice, Travis.

## You looking for some action?
Well... I guess so.

## Why you hang around with them greasers?
A girl needs protection.

## What's your name?
Easy.

## What's your real name?
I don't like my real name.

## What's your real name?
Iris.

## I drive a taxi. You tried to get away one night. Remember?
No.

## We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?
I don't want to make it. I came here to get you out.

## Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.

## Do they drug you?
Oh, come off it, man.

## You can do it in my mouth.
Don't you want to make it? Can't you make it?

## Do you understand why I came here?
I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.

## Don't you want to go?
I can leave anytime I want.

## But that one night?
I was stoned. That's why they stopped me. When I'm not stoned, I got no place else to go. They just protect me from myself.

## Can I see you again?
That's not hard to do.

## Well, you want to or not?
O.K. It's a date. I'll see you here, then.

## Where?
Pittsburgh.

## Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
God, you are square.

## Who's a killer?
That fella \"Sport\" looks like a killer to me.

## Huh?
I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.

## Why don't you come to a commune with me?
Me? I could never go to a place like that.

## Why not?
I... I don't get along with people like that.

## Why?
I've got something important to do. I can't leave.

## What's so important?
I can't say -- it's top secret. I'm doing something for the Army. The cab thing is just part time.

## Do I look like a narc?
Yeah.

## What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard?
Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.

## What should I do? Call the cops?
Cops don't do nothin.

## How?
I don't know. Just should, though. Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.

## Sure you don't want to come with me?
I can't. Otherwise, I would.

## What do you mean?
My work may take me out of New York.

## Then it's a good guess it's grounded.
Why should it be grounded?

## Have you tried the telephone?
Yes I am.

## Travis, what single thing would you want the next President of this country to do most?
I don't know, sir. I don't follow political issues much.

## No trouble with the Hack Bureau?
No Sir.

## Got your license?
Yes.

## So why do you want to be a taxi driver?
I can't sleep nights.

## So whatja do now?
I ride around nights mostly. Subways, buses. See things. Figur'd I might as well get paid for it.

## You want to work uptown nights?
I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy.

## How's your driving record?
Clean. Real clean. As clean as my conscience.

## Physical? Criminal?
Also clean.

## Age?
Twenty-six.

## Education?
Some. Here and there.

## Military record?
Honorable discharge. May 1971.

## You moonlightin?
No, I want long shifts.

## MAN Why do you ask?
I've seen a lot of suspicious-looking people around here today.

## MAN Who?
Oh, lots. I don't know where they all are now. There used to be one standing over there.

## MAN Why?
I kinda thought I might make a good one. I'm very observant.

## MAN Oh?
I was in the Army too. And I'm good with crowds.

## What kind of guns do you guys use? .38's?
MAN Look, um, if you give me your name and address, we'll send you the information on how to apply.

## You would, huh?
MAN Sure.

## Your name Sport?
Anything you say, officer.

## Hey, Sport. How are things?
O.K., cowboy.

## What's going on?
I'm here to see Iris.

## Yeah, Iris. You know anybody by that name?
No. Hillbilly, you'd better get your wise ass outa here and quick, or you're gonna be in trouble.

## So howsit?
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.

## What's the action around?
Slow.

## Yeah?
Look, ah, we never talked much, you and me...

## Yeah?
I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.

## Things got ya down?
Real down.

## You want to talk about it?
Not really.

## Could we change the subject?
That record company.in Nashville wants to hear my demo tape.

## You think I'm too... ethnic for country music?
Carla Pestalozzi? No. Definitely not. You could have posed for the Mona= Lisa. Sophia Loren looks Swedish next to you.

## What is happening? Where's Mason?
He says he's leaving the island sir.

## During the time I cooperate, will I be outside? Outside a jail?
Well yes I suppose ...

## You suppose?
Yes. You'll be outside.

## Motor oil?
For cottonmouth. Goodspeed and the S.E.A.L.s exchange looks.

## Limp dick?
It's all I could think of.

## What, vou?
I'm not the chemical weapons expert.

## What are you doing?
Now they only have three rockets left.

## Mason. Mason?
It's about time.

## Partners?
Partners.

## You knew? All this time?
I'm not a fool, Billy.

## What's that? Mason?
Hi.

## This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he?
Oh, yes. Yes, he was.

## But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?

## What about you, Delly?
I am, too.

## You'll stand by me?
Whatever happens.

## You've got everything?
Yeah. Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact.

## And who's gonna run the projector until you get back? Mrs. Terwilliger?
Maybe we could train Cat to run the projector. You know, a system of scratching posts, and gears, and levers...

## Did you bring along something to read?
Damn...

## Okay. What's the second thing?
Delly? In here.

## How'd it go?
Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.

## That always used to work.
That's my girl! Did you...?

## Yeah, well it's not everyday you get news like this. You're sure he's okay? Other than the bump on the head?
Well...

## You mean, me?
It's possible.

## Do you... remember me?
I've seen you before. Your picture...

## I do?
Yeah, a little. I think you grew an inch or so. And you've lost weight.

## City hall?
You must not remember anything. Come on.

## Why me?
Be a gentleman. You have to help me down.

## How'd they get it inside?
Through the door. It comes apart.

## And why not?
Whoa.

## Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.

## You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?
Actually, I was married. For four years. But... well, we didn't fit together. I'm divorced now.

## What was that?
Nothing.

## Were we going to get married?
Eventually. We were going to be engaged... when you came back from overseas...

## What?
We've done this before, so many times. The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.

## What about a loan? You could go to the bank...?
Well, there's got to be a way...

## I don't smoke?
You tried to once. It was pretty pitiful.

## My what?
Huh. That was nice of me.

## How do you tell those two apart, anyway?
Alex and Charlie? Simple. Alex is the smarter one.

## What... do you remember?
Well... everything. It started coming back a couple of days ago. I remember everything now.

## Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.
And what is the state of your memory now?

## Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
Start with what you knew then.

## Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?
Well, if you'd seen Miss Angstrom...

## All right, Mr. Appleton. That was what you knew then. What do you know now?
Mr. Chairman, the witness is being non-responsive...

## Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the communist party?
No, sir.

## Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
I'm not refuting anything.

## Well, then, as what did you go?
I do.

## A statement?
Yes. A prepared statement.

## Mr. Appleton? Mr. Appleton?
I... I need a drink of water.

## Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office?
Listen to me! The young man in there...

## Ben, when's Delly due back?
Here we are.

## No identification at all. What're you thinkin', Cecil?
Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here. Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory.

## You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge?
No. But...

## But what?
Well, this place sorta reminds me of something.

## C'mon, I'll give you two a lift back to the Bijou.
What's that?

## The Bijou?
Well, no, but these gentlemen would like to get some answers...

## That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
The days of the storefront grocery are numbered. I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket.

## Excuse me... what's your, um, your name?
Harry, son. Harry.

## And... what's my name again?
Albert Lucas Trumbo. But you've been \"Luke\" since you were a baby.

## When did I leave?
You joined up one month to the day after Pearl Harbor. January seventh... nineteen forty-two.

## Didn't you have any help?
That's Lily. Your mother, rest her soul.

## Who... are they?
This is the staff of the Bijou.

## Oh. What... what time is it?
Six-thirty. I thought we'd get an early start.

## Um... Harry? Did I ever keep the books here?
No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.

## Yeah, I know, but poultry...?
But I...

## Why don't you two get out there and dance?
Oh, no, I...

## Beautiful, wasn't it?
Six-thirty. I thought we'd get an early start.

## Did I what?
Did you fix the damn film? It broke in the last reel.

## Anybody take it?
A few.

## Pete. You think maybe you've had enough?
Bought the bottle, didn't I? To the United States of America. Long my she wave.

## The G-man?
Zackly.

## Sure, I suppose. That why you're on a bender?
This is not a bender yet. This is the start of a bender. But I can see how you were confused, they look a lot alike.

## Pete... go home. Come on, I'll call that girlfriend of yours, what's her name... Sandy?
Sandra Sinclair.

## Any idea how you got here, son?
No, sir.

## Been drinkin' a bit, have we?
I don't remember. I guess so. Smells like it. Tastes like it.

## And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
I... no, I... I just can't...

## That's where you live.
What is it?

## We live in a theater?
Evening, Luke.

## What's wrong?
Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...

## Aren't you coming?
No, I'm not much of a dancer.

## Can we get him to the hospital?
Even if we could, and the move didn't kill him, there'd be very little we could do there that we can't do here. I'm sorry.

## You smell gas?
Don't smell nothin'. He must not be dead in here.

## You think he's drunk somewhere?
Wouldn't blame him if he was.

## What's his rent?
Thirty a month.

## Huh?
Take a hike. Am-scray.

## Peter, their hands are tied. You see that, don't you?
I... I don't believe this.

## What? That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one?
They know you were at that meeting, Peter. They've been told, and they know.

## Why not?
Yeah, well, that's enough.

## I'm not sorry for what I said.
Don't say that. There is no such thing as a blacklist. Now, are you gonna play ball?

## Cigarette?
No thanks.

## When'd you quit smoking?
Luke didn't smoke.

## Why not?
Not at all.

## What do you mean?
Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.

## What, all of a sudden, \"Lucille Angstrom\" isn't a name?
Her name was right there in front of them. They gave it to me, I didn't give it to them.

## Climb down off your cross. They already knew about her. She was subpoenaed six months ago! Who the hell do you think named you?
I haven't danced with another man since Mr. Terwilliger passed.

## When was that?
Nineteen-oh-nine.

## I can play the piano?
No.

## So I guess this fellow belongs to you. What's his name?
Cat. That's simple. I like it. Hi, Cat.

## We thought you was dead, you know. It's okay that I live here?
Of course.

## Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?
Sure. Come on in. I was just packing.

## Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that?
I thought you...

## Pete, there's time before the picture starts, you want to get some popcorn?
You bet, honey.

## What exactly did you hear?
That you got let go.

## He was, but he got sick. We got a new director today. Why?
Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching.

## You mean, he was... let go, too?
They're saying I'm a communist, Sandy. But I'm not, you know that. I'm gonna fight 'em, and I'm gonna win, but I'll need your help.

## Will you help me, Sandy?
I'll have to think about this. I have to get back... I should go...

## Ancestors?
Actually, my grandpap. But \"ancestors\" sounds better, don't it? Here.

## Course they all know me. And I know all them. Town's got my name, don't it?
Ernie Cole here just got himself elected mayor. Lost both his boys in the war. Kenny at Anzio and Willie at Normandy.

## You hungry, son?
Yes. Very.

## Got any money?
Thank you, Mr. Lawson.

## Now that you remember who you are, were you planning on telling anyone your true identity?
I already have.

## Who?
My girlfriend. If she still is...

## Would that be Miss Sinclair?
No. No, not Miss Sinclair. I'm talking about Adele Lardner.

## Mr. Appleton, I have reason to believe you're holding something back, and that just rubs me the wrong way. Sir, are you a communist?
No. Absolutely not.

## Yes?
I'm Melanie Daniels. I'm sorry to bother you, but...

## Yes?
The man at the post office sent me. He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl.

## The one who lives in the white house across the bay?
That's the one. Cathy Brenner.

## Are you a friend of Mitch's?
No, not really.

## Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time. There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay. Did you plan on staying long?
No. Just a few hours.

## You're leaving after you see Cathy?
Well... something like that. I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.

## Did you drive up from San Francisco?
Yes.

## It's a nice drive. Is that where you met Mitch?
Yes.

## Do I? No, I'm an open book, I'm afraid. Or maybe a closed one. Pretty. What are they?
Lovebirds.

## Oh, hi! Did you find her all right?
Yes, I did.

## That sign. Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...

## Sure. You can have it. Where's your bag? In the car?
It's utilitarian, I'll say that for it.

## Miss Daniels? Is that you?
Yes.

## Hi. Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?
No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.

## Would you like some brandy?
If you have some, I'd...

## No, thank you. Won't you call me Melanie?
All right.

## Or would you rather I changed the subject?
I think so.

## How do you like our little hamlet?
I despise it.

## Where are you from originally, Annie?
San Francisco.

## How'd you happen to come here?
Oh, someone invited me up for the weekend a long time ago.

## When was this?
Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died. Things may be different now.

## With Lydia. Did she seem a trifle distant?
A trifle.

## Then what was it?
Lydia liked me, you see. That was the strange part of it. In fact, now that I'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends.

## Then why did she object to you?
Because she was afraid.

## Afraid you'd take Mitch?
Afraid I'd give Mitch.

## What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
I see.

## You get straight to the point, don't you?
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

## And the second?
He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon. I said I would.

## Do you think I should go?
That's up to you.

## Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
Yes.

## Is anyone there?
Look.

## No, Cathy. He sold Mr. Fawcett a different brand. You don't think they're getting sick, do you, Mitch?
Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods.

## Take them.
Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in here?

## Yes?
They're beautiful! They're just what I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? I can't tell which is which.

## Is smoking fun?
Oh, I suppose so.

## Could I have a puff?
I don't think your mother would like that.

## Are you coming to my party?
I don't think so. I have to get back to San Francisco.

## Don't you like Bodega Bay?
I don't know yet.

## Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?
She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.

## What's the matter with them?
We've got an extra room upstairs and everything.

## Did you put the cover on that cage, Mom?
Mitch? Why are they doing this? The birds.

## Why are they trying to kill people?
Mitch, let's turn back.

## Mitch? Do... do you think they'll be all right? In the trunk? Can they breath?
I think they'll be all right, honey.

## What?
The little Brenner girl.

## Do you know him?
Yep.

## Where does he live?
Right here. Bodega Bay.

## Yes, but where?
Right across the bay there.

## And the white house?
That's where the Brenners live.

## The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.

## The two kids?
Yep. Mitch and the little girl.

## I see. How do I get down there?
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.

## The front door. Isn't there a back road I can take?
Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.

## Down at the dock by the Tides Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard boat?
Of course.

## D'you want me to order one for you?
Thank you.

## What name?
Daniels.

## Yep?
The little girl's name.

## The little Brenner girl?
Yes.

## Are you sure?
Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.

## Yes?
Thank you.

## How much for the phone calls?
It's nothing.

## Why not, Mrs. Bundy?
Young woman cut herself.

## You cut yourself outside, Miss?
Let me have some apple pie, Helen. Who said anything about war? All I said was that some gulls...

## One apple pie! You want more coffee?
No. ...came down on one of my boats. They could have been after the fish, just as you said.

## Here's your pie, Sebastian. You want it at the table?
No. Here's fine.

## I thought I saw your car. What are you doing in town?
I had to acknowledge a delivery. Mother, I'd like you to meet...

## A what?
Melanie Daniels. Melanie, my mother.

## How do you do, Miss Daniels? Acknowledge a what?
A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels brought some birds from San Francisco.

## For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
Across at Brinkmeyer's.

## You did say birds?
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...

## I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels. Where are you staying?
There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now.

## He sold the feed to me, didn't he?
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.

## Whose side are you on?
I'm simply quoting the law.

## She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch?
Yes, very.

## How long have you known her?
I told you. We met yesterday.

## Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that. She's very rich, isn't she?
I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.

## She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
Yes, Mother.

## Yes?
I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.

## Well... well, is everyone all right?
I think he got a little scratch, Mother.

## Did you you get the windows in the attic, Mitch?
I got them all, Mother.

## When do you think they'll come?
I don't know.

## When?
I don't know when. We'll see what...

## Where will we go?
I don't know yet. I think we'll be safe here. Let's bring that wood in.

## What happens when we run out of wood?
I don't know. We'll break up the furni...

## You don't know, you don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead? Like Annie?
Mother! I'm trying my best! I'm... trying... my...

## If... If... when we get to San Francisco... If they're already there?
They won't be.

## If they are?
We'll worry about that when we get there.

## Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, is that right?
No, not exactly.

## Yeah, and the freeway's well-lighted, isn't it, Mitch?
No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought you might like some tea.

## Where's Mitch?
Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.

## Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.

## What?
Cathy. At the school.

## Do I sound foolish to you?
No.

## Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
Yes, I think so. My son is important to me. I want to like any girl he chooses.

## And if you don't?
Then I don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.

## Would you like me to go for her?
I couldn't ask you to.

## Did you close the door?
And locked it.

## I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
Well... Well... these birds attacked us.

## Oh, yeah, yeah. How old is she now?
Eleven. In the middle of the party, some gulls came down at the children. And Miss Daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after...

## Does this room look silly?
Well, if there's anything else I can do, Mitch...

## Is that for Mitch Brenner?
Yes.

## Yes. I don't think you should leave them in the hall, do you?
Well, I...

## Well, where did he go?
Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.

## Bodega Bay? Where's that?
Up on the coast. About sixty miles north of here.

## What?
I said I wonder if you could help me.

## Yes, what was it you were looking for, sir?
Lovebirds.

## Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?
Well... yes, sir, there are.

## Do you have a pair that are just friendly?
I think so, sir. Now then, let me see.

## Aren't these lovebirds?
No, sir, those are... redbirds.

## All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.

## I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.

## Are they moulting now?
Some of them are.

## How can you tell?
Well... they get a sort of hangdog expression.

## What did you say?
I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.

## But how... how do you know my name?
A little birdie told me. Good day, Miss Daniels. Madam.

## How?
We met in court.

## What are you? A policeman?
I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.

## What's that?
Just some peroxide. I want to clean out the cut.

## What kind of law?
Criminal.

## Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday. Besides, I was coming up anyway.

## I'm sorry. Who's your friend?
Why...

## Yes?
Annie. Annie Hayworth.

## How do you know Annie?
We... we went to school together. College.

## Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.

## It's still bleeding a little. Here, let me put this on.
I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?

## So you came up to see Annie, huh?
Yes.

## Why would I want to see you, of all people?
I don't know. But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was, and where I lived and...

## You like me, huh?
I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.

## None of your business. Am I still bleeding?
Can't see a thing.

## Yes, but...
But you were coming up anyway, remember?

## You are, aren't you?
Certainly, but...

## Then it's settled. What time is dinner, Mother?
With... with Annie, of course.

## Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?
Annie... Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I can find my own way.

## You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything?
I'm sure.

## Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm glad you came. Are you hungry?
Famished.

## Why did he shoot her?
He was watching a ball game on television.

## What?
His wife changed the channel.

## You'll be able to find your way back, won't you?
Oh, yes.

## Will I be seeing you again?
San Francisco's a long way from here.

## How does Mother know what I like to do?
I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.

## Without any clothes on?
With all my clothes on! The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper. Anything they said...

## You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...

## ...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.

## Sure. Do you really know Annie Hayworth?
No. At least, I didn't until I came up here.

## Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?
I wrote the letter.

## What did it say?
It said, \"Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality.\" That's what it said.

## Why?
Because it seemed stupid and foolish.

## Why?
I think it could be fun.

## Cheers.
What do you want ?

## Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.

## You have a job?
I have several jobs.

## What do you do?
I do different things on different days.

## Like what?
On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.

## And Fridays? What do you do then?
Nothing. I go to bird shops on Fridays.

## What'll it say?
You'll think me very bold, sir.

## Are you all right?
Yes.

## I don't know, Melanie. Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
No, I have my things in the car.

## Do you want some mustard with this?
No, thank you.

## Some cream?
I'll get it.

## I think I should, don't you?
It smelled of the fire.

## Of birds?
Certainly, of birds.

## Mmm?
With my little sparrow leading team.

## What do you mean?
After the gulls attacked.

## I got here as fast as I could. Where's Cathy?
At Annie's house. She's all right.

## How long have they been gathering there?
The past fifteen minutes. It seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? They strike and disappear, and then they start massing again.

## Do you want to try your father again?
I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.

## Have we still got power?
Yes. I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very tired.

## Where are they heading?
Inland.

## Santa Rosa?
Maybe.

## When will they stop?
I thought they'd have stopped by now.

## What time is it?
Almost two a.m.

## How about you?
You'd have been safe in San Francisco.

## Can we turn back?
I... I don't think so. If we get through town, I think we'll be all right.

## Hello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever seen so many gulls?
Hello, Miss Daniels.

## What do you suppose it is?
I was hoping you'd be a little late, Miss Daniels. You see, he hasn't arrived yet.

## Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.

## And he'll talk?
Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.

## Yes. Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock. Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?
I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address.

## I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?
Well, all right, but...

## That... that... who was that?
I have no idea.

## Have you got a pencil?
What? Oh, yes, certainly.

## No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone?
Yes, certainly.

## Do you have any lovebirds?
No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you.

## Thank you. Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?
I just came from the school, madam. I don't know about their brain pans but...

## What do you think they were after, Miss...?
Daniels. I think they were after the children.

## For what purpose?
Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...

## Maybe! Is it impossible?
Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.

## Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.

## It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
I like Bodega Bay as well as any man. If I thought...

## Help how? What do you want to do?
I'm not sure, but...

## How?
Mrs. Bundy, you said something about Santa Cruz. About seagulls getting lost in the fog, and heading in for the lights.

## How do you plan to do that?
With smoke.

## Can we go on living here otherwise?
Scotch, light on the water.

## Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
We need them.

## How many gulls did you count, Mrs. Bundy?
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.

## Were the Santa Rosa police at your school today? Are you coming?
Take it easy, lady. There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.

## I'm leaving! Are you coming?
All right, all right! Hope you figure this out, folks.

## Mr. Gray?
That's right. Gray, the cabman. I've had a bit of dealing with MacFarlane in the past, you know.

## But can't you give me any idea?
How could I? I will do my best. After all, you see, I am financially interested.

## You asked to see me, ma'am?
I want you to help my little girl.

## Did he tell you about Georgina?
I didn't mean it that way. I meant only that I am not in a position to ask favors.

## You have his promise, then?
Yes.

## It's not because of Georgina -- because of Dr. MacFarlane's failure?
You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.

## Gray has no need to threaten. You remember the trial?
I heard my parents speak of it in Thrums. It was a famous case.

## And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
Aye.

## Where can I find him?
You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.

## I saw the woman whose son's body was delivered last night.
Well? And are you not a good student?

## And that's why you don't want to be a doctor, Fettes?
Not if I have to be party to things like that, Dr. MacFarlane.

## Dr. MacFarlane -- you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday -- the lady with the little girl?
I remember her.

## I just saw Gray. What was he laughing at?
He has his own idea of a joke. Perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs.

## What do you mean, Fettes?
I'll have no more to do with it. I'll not put my neck into the noose, not even for your sake, Dr. MacFarlane.

## What's that you say?
Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel? I've had some practice in the art.

## Where shall we put it? In the back?
No room there. We'll have to set it between us.

## Are you a doctor, too?
Not yet.

## What you really want to ask me is about my back, isn't it -- about where it hurts?
The white horse. The horse that is going to greet me when he sees me.

## Why do you want the white horse to bid you \"good-day\"?
He was a nice horse.

## Maybe there's another reason. Maybe you haven't friends enough. Could that be it, Georgina?
Don't you want to find the white horse, Georgina? You can't find him from a wheelchair. You have to walk and run to find him.

## I will not have you use that name to me.
A doctor?

## You will not have it?
You're a teacher, eh? Maybe you're afraid to be a doctor, Toddy.

## Afraid of what?
Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.

## You? Why? Since when have you become the protector of little children?
I'll not do it, Gray.

## Hear him? Did you ever see the lads play knife?
Now that wasn't a friendly thing I heard, Toddy. Not at all friendly.

## Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
The heart pumps it.

## But what makes a thought start?
In the brain, I tell you. I know.

## Why should I be afraid of you? What are you holding over me?
I brought you something tonight, MacFarlane -- an interesting specimen -- in very good condition.

## So, Toddy, you've made me a disease, eh?
I can't understand your hurt to me -- but I must cut you out.

## Would you bribe me to leave you be?
I would make you rich.

## But why, Gray? Why?
Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me.

## A pleasure to torment me?
I presume you shall. This won't be my last visit here.

## Can anyone hear what we say?
Only Brother.

## I have made you give me money, but you smile. Aren't you angry?
No, Joseph. I'm not angry -- here -- another glass of brandy --I'll wager it's better than the doctor's.

## That was Hare's end. Ah, you should have seen him on the streets, when he saw some old beldam deep in drink how he cozened her!
But where did they get those people?

## I'll show you how it was done, Joseph. -- I'll show you how they \"Burked\" them.
We could do that. But when he had them there, then what?

## How long after that was the paralysis complete?
Nearly a year.

## Any attacks of pain since?
Yes, Doctor.

## Is her pain sporadic or constant?
It comes at intervals. They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent -- much more frequent.

## Child seems to take to the lad. What sort of an accident was it, Ma'am?
A carriage overturned. My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt.

## How long ago?
Three years.

## I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
But can anything be done for her?

## There's nothing I can say for one small child?
But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.

## Did it spoil me, Meg, my lass?
You're daft. What's Gray to me. He's only a man from whom I buy what I need when I need it -- the rest is forgotten.

## You can get out.
No great lady will ever take my place?

## Fettes -- where is Fettes?
I'll get him.

## Can I get you something? A glass of water? A transfusion?
Where are they? Last chance.

## around, or whatever the hell you're doing here. What are you doing here?
I'm looking for my friends.

## How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?
You sent them. I had no choice.

## Yeah? I see doubt oozing out your arm. Where do people go when they kill their girlfriends?
Was that it? Well, ok.

## What do they do that they had to kill her?
I believe they call it a connoisseur's club. Owned by DELT.

## I guess it's true. Guns don't kill people...
Where is it? This place?

## Think maybe knives do?
Keep that thing away from me.

## Fuck! What do you want?
A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.

## Where the fuck did you come from?
You lied at my trial.

## What did they give you?
AAAANK. That's not how we play the game.

## Not my arm! What you fucking want?
I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.

## The scar. Which of you has it?
Nobody.

## How can you die if you're already dead?
You're him. Corvis.

## And he's right over there by the way. What did you do to your face?
Someone else did it.

## How do you know?
I told you, I knew your sister.

## No! Why are you haunting me?
Because you need to understand. And you need... to be careful.

## Are you ok?
No...

## So you're going to kill him?
Have to find him first.

## Erin. Who?
I don't know. I found him lying there.

## Guy dressed for Halloween?
Good for you. You do know something.

## How about sign of a big black bird?
The dead can return, given sufficient motivation. And Corvis has that.

## You two are majorly demented. Anyone ever tell you that?
Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan? Because there's a ghost threatening us.

## Anything wrong?
Let's hope not. License and registration please.

## What's with your friend there?
She's... sick. Actually she never had Mai Tais before.

## If you had a license, I bet I'd have seen it by now. How old are you? Fifteen?
Look, I'll tell you the truth. Jannie drove us and was supposed to drive us back, she has a license, but I mean... look at her.

## You want me to walk a straight line?
I want you... to bend over.

## Why are there so many?
This guy said he was a friend of Lauren's. He had like paint all over his face.

## What is it?
The cop who found the knife in Corvis's car.

## What? What is it?
Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.

## What about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight? Have they all arrived?
I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting.

## Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter?
He'll be there at 8,30.

## That's good, Hilda. I'm glad.
Tell me, Hilda -- does all this frighten you -- does it make you feel insecure?

## You wrote this?
It was a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but I understand you're a difficult man to see. I thought you'd have the solution by this time.

## Yes -- that will reproduce the first- order terms. But what about the effect of the other terms?
Almost negligible... With variation of parameters, this is the answer.

## How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another. I understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship.

## Would you care to be more specific?
What I have to say must be said to all concerned. It is too important to be entrusted to any individual.

## What -- what sort of action do you mean?
That's what I came to see you about.

## You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
No -- not at all.

## What about your personal safety in the meantime? What about the Army -- and the police?
My name is Carpenter and I'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house.

## One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be-- --eliminated.

## Such power exists?
I assure you such power exists.

## Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?
Yes -- of course.

## Something dramatic -- but not destructive. It's quite an interesting problem. Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?
Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man.

## Boy, we had a swell time. Didn't we, Mr. Carpenter?
Come on, Bobby. Time to go to bed.

## Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have to go down to the police station?
I -- I don't know, dear... Perhaps there's some mistake.

## Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?
Of course, dear.

## Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt?
Sure we did! He wasn't there but we went to see him. And Mr. Carpenter showed him how to do his arithmetic.

## You didn't really see the space ship. You just thought you did.
Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour?

## He gave these to you?
Well, not exactly. I gave him two dollars.

## Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?
Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed.

## Yeah -- the grass was kind of wet.
Oh, boy -- can I, Mom?

## Are you an FBI man?
No -- I'm afraid not.

## Bobby -- who's the greatest man in America today?
Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess.

## He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
Sure. Right near where my mother works.

## Where is that?
Boy, I'll bet he's strong. I bet he could knock down a whole building.

## Gee, I'd like to get inside and see how it works. What do you think makes it go?
Well -- atomic power, I would imagine.

## You think it can go faster than an F- 36?
Yes -- I think so.

## You think they'll ever find him?
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.

## Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
Velocity is the time rate of change of position.

## Wouldn't you like to meet him?
Well, sure I would, but -- Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.

## What does that mean?
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.

## Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
No -- I'm afraid not.

## Is it different where you've been? Don't they have places like this?
They have cemeteries. But not like this one... You see, they don't have any wars.

## Certainly. Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?
I've got some money. My mother gave me two dollars.

## Bet they're worth about a million dollars.
No -- I want to take you to the movies. Do you think they'd accept these?

## Let's not say anything to my mother about this, Mr. Carpenter.
Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?

## Why not, Bobby?
She doesn't like me to steal from people.

## Bobby -- have you a flashlight?
Yeah -- sure. It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.

## What do you want it for, Mr. Carpenter?
Why -- the light in my room went out. Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.

## And the lungs are the same as ours. Must mean a similar atmosphere -- similar pressure. How old do you think he is?
Oh, I'd say forty-five.

## How does he explain that?
He says their medicine is that much more advanced. He was very nice about it. But he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor.

## I'm sure I don't have to point out that your arrival was something of a surprise. Had you been traveling long?
About five months -- your months.

## The present situation?
I mean the reasons for my coming here.

## We're very curious about that, too. Would you care to talk about it?
I'd be glad to. Not now, of course -- with you alone.

## You know about the United Nations?
We could call a special meeting of the General Assembly... But of course the UN doesn't represent all of the nations.

## Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?
Believe me, you don't understand. They wouldn't sit down at the same table.

## Thank you... Have you any news?
It's not your government I'm thinking about. It's your world.

## You ready?
I will be in just a minute.

## Is it real?
Looks real to me.

## You think it's all right for you to stay here?
I've got a good lock on my door. And Bobby's going to sleep in my room tonight.

## What about him?
All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.

## How do you know?
Never mind about that. You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody.

## Are you crazy? After what happened today?
You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.

## Is that what you're thinking about?
Why not? Somebody's got to get rid of him.

## Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my business, but -- why did that detective come here last night?
I -- I was Just going to lunch.

## Yes--?
I want to know what he told you last night.

## What time is it?
Just twelve.

## Why not?
You see -- the electricity's been neutralized -- all over the world.

## No, wait a minute -- there's someone else.
Where are you going now?

## Who?
Tom... He was there last night when Bobby told me what he saw.

## Where is the meeting going to be?
At the ship.

## Gort? But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?
\"Klaatu barada nikto.\"

## You mean he has the power of life and death?
No -- that is a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit.

## But how -- how long--?
How long will I live? That no one can say.

## How dare you write on that blackboard! Do you realize the Professor has been working on that problem for weeks?
He'll catch on to it in no time now.

## How did you get in here? And what do you want?
We came to see Professor Barnhardt.

## I have never seen such a stone. Will you please tell me where it came from?
That's what I wanted you to tell me.

## Would you like to sell it?
No -- no, thanks.

## Your name's Carpenter -- that right? Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? Driver's license -- social security number?
No -- I'm afraid not.

## Well, how do I know who you are?
You don't.

## They would have killed this man?
People get hysterical enough, they do anything. Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.

## How long will that take?
They can tell right away. They've got a couple of doctors who saw this man in the hospital. Take him over to G2.

## Just passing through Santa Carla?
I don't like horror comics.

## How do you like Santa Carla?
It's a pretty cool place if you're a Martian.

## Yeah, you think we just work in a comic book store for our dad, huh?
This isn't a comic book store, right. It's a bakery.

## Can't stand light?
Wears sunglasses in the house.

## Why not?
He's my brother.

## Time to activate Plan B.
Exactly how many vampires have you actually destroyed?

## What's Plan B?
We've been aware of some very serious vampire activity in this town for a long time.

## All together?
Zero.

## Okay. Where's Nosferatu?
The Prince of Darkness.

## Four to go.
Should I run him through?

## Whattaya mean?
That's right.

## So how do you like those maggots, Michael?
What?...

## Get your bike. We're going someplace.
You're eating maggots. How do they taste?

## If you ever want to see Star again, then you better come with us.
What's going' on?

## Where you going?
For a ride.

## With him?
Yeah.

## Where the hell are you from, Kryton?
Phoenix actually and these Bullwinkle and...

## Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?
You think you're cool, don't you? You think you know what's really happening, don't you? Well, you don't know shit, buddy.

## Bad breath? Long fingernails?
His fingernails are longer, but he always has bad breath.

## How do you know they're not?
He's not glowing.

## He's telling the truth! Aren't you, Michael?
To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.

## What's that smell!?
Vampires, my friend. Vampires.

## What?
There's a cop behind us.

## What happens in tow and a half hours?
The dun goes down and they'll be comin' for us.

## I don't want names! Just lead me to him. Where's their nest?
I'll take you there.

## Smells good. When do we eat?
I told Max eight o'clock.

## Max? You men we're having company again?
Again'? Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago.

## You have a T.V.?
Great. I wanna get some new comics.

## Are we havin' fun or what?
I thought we were goin' into town.

## Did we have a date tonight?
I guess so. She said not to be late.

## Who, Laddie?
Laddie... you can still remember. You can still remember home.

## You didn't tell David?
No. Just you.

## Still mad at me?
For what.

## It's early. Why do we have to go home?
Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.

## Michael, are you still in bed?
No. I'm up.

## Okay?
Okay.

## Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
We are...

## Not that poor.
What's that smell?

## You've heard this story before?
So many times, I'm starting to think it happened to me.

## Can we get a T.V.?
Lights out, Sam.

## Mom. I think we've got to have a long talk about something?
What's wrong? Tell me.

## Where's Michael?
He's already gone to bed.

## In here?
Do you mind? It was a real scary comic.

## Oh, no. Now what?
Must be a circuit breaker.

## -- a job.
What did you say?

## Do I look that needy?
Say hello to Thorn.

## Not impressed, are you?
Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.

## But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
I hear this is the decade for cute.

## Is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner?
It's garlic!! I like garlic, but...

## Something the matter?
No, no. Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.

## I thought you said they needed discipline?
Well... what do I know? I'm a bachelor. Lucy... this is going to be a very special night, I promise you.

## Max... what are you talking about?
It was all going to be so perfect, Lucy. One big happy family. My boys... and yours.

## How about a little Parmesan cheese on that?
Okay, Sam. Thanks.

## I am?
Yeah. I'm not trying to replace your Dad... or steal your Mom. I just want to be your friend.

## Are you following me?
Well, I...

## Did you want to talk to me?
Well... yeah. Sure.

## What's your name?
Star.

## What do you mean?
Ex-hippies. My mom was one. I came this close to being called Moon Child, or Moon Beam or something. But Star's great. I like Star.

## Are you hungry? Wanna get something to eat?
Okay.

## When?
Tonight. At the boardwalk...

## I have to talk to you. Can I come up?
Okay.

## Why not?
Because I love you...

## Huh?
Save Laddie first.

## They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?
They'll be coming for all of us.

## Will you give Mom a break?
Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.

## Where are we going?
Nowhere.

## What would that make Mom?
You're right... not even to mention you and me.

## No. Why?
The bottoms of your feet are covered with salt.

## Wanna go to the comic book store?
No.

## Michael?
Don't turn on the light.

## What happened, Michael!?
Nanook...

## What about Mom?
No! We can't tell Mom! Please, Sam. Don't tell her.

## It's that girl from the boardwalk. Is she one of them?
I don't know.

## Who are you calling?
The Marines.

## I... I don't feel any differently. Do you?
Sixteen.

## What do you want from us?
Just listen.

## Where these tracks headed?
Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.

## What do you mean \"got\" to the dog?
It was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce, whatever it ate or absorbed, cell for cell.

## That night?
Yeah.

## What was he doing in the rec room?
Well, after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest. Left the room for a bit. When I came back, he was gone.

## Well, where was he? Where did he go?
Don't know. Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.

## How long were you with the dog? Alone, I mean?
Ah... He was hurt bad. Bullet nicked an artery... I don't know... An hour... hour and a half...

## What the hell you looking at me like that for?
Nothing. Nothing at all.

## Was that dog, the Norwegian dog?
I just can't comprehend any of this. It was just a dog.

## Sure. You think there's a connection?
Maybe.

## So what's our problem?
Well... there's still some cell activity... it's not entirely dead yet.

## Anybody sick?
No, I... I don't mean infection... or disease...

## Finish what?
... I think the whole process would have taken an hour... maybe more. And then I suppose both would have changed back to dog form.

## Well, who the hell you think wants to get in there with you?
Now why'd you go and...

## You promise?
I don't know who to trust.

## What?
Watch him close. Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.

## Have you come across Fuchs?
Don't walk behind me.

## What's it going to do, being a plant?
We got to burn 'em.

## Am I starting to look Norwegian to you, Bwana?
I suppose... well, it's possible someone might have lifted it from me. But...

## That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt. Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
Look, I haven't been near that... that refrigerator.

## Cut him loose of the line up by his shack.
Childs! That a fuse?

## Cut him loose?
When we were up poking around his place... I found this...

## ... So it crashes, and this guy, whoever he is, gets thrown out, or walks out, and ends up freezing.
What's happening?

## Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
I don't know how. Because he's different than we are. Because he's a space guy. What do you want from me, anyway. Go ask Blair.

## You buy any of this, Blair?
I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.

## Where's the other half?
We got morphine, don't we.

## What clothes?
You been made, MacReady.

## What for?
For your health.

## So, I don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down.
If we've got any surprises for each other -- we shouldn't be in any condition to do anything about it. You play chess?

## My God, what in hell happened here?
All in Norwegian.

## What are you doing?
Could be important work. Might as well bring it back.

## Well, who's got access to it?
I guess I'm the only one.

## Would that test have worked?
I think so.

## Goes on like that quite awhile. What do you gentlemen make of it?
Could be anything... Men in isolation... some beef that snowballed... got out of hand...

## How long will it take you to prepare this?
A couple of hours.

## Can there be... some kind of test? To find out who's what?
A serum test possibly.

## When was the last time you used it?
A day or so ago... I guess.

## How far's that?
Bout eighty kilos southwest.

## How many in their party?
Started with six. There'd be four others left.

## You reach anybody yet?
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man. It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.

## You're not thinking of going after them, are you?
I am going after them.

## Palmer, how long would it take you to strap those big four-cylinder carburetors on?
Ah... no one... I give it to Copper when he needs it...

## Could anyone have gotten it from you?
Let's rush him. He's not going to blow us all up.

## How long's it been?
What's...

## No it ain't there. Would I be asking if it were there?
Move it, Palmer.

## We going to make it?
Hope so. Another ten, fifteen minutes. What I don't get is...

## What kind of test?
I'm sure a lot of you already know.

## Screw the flashlights. Where the hell were you?
We've got to find Fuchs. When we find him -- we kill him.

## Why?
If he's one of those Things, we've got to get to him before he changes... Nauls, you and Childs and I'll check the outside shacks...

## What if it doesn't come?
It'll come. It needs us. We're the only thing left to imitate... Give me a hand.

## This storm do that?
Couldn't be possible. Must have weighted a ton and a half...

## What is it?
Everything that's been missing.

## Where was he trying to go?
Anyplace but here.

## What about Childs?
Forget about Childs. He's over.

## You crazy? He might be inside already?
Chance we got to take. We got to force him to come down the east side to the door we got rigged.

## We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
Get your gear on.

## What for?
Magnesium of some type... or some kind of strange alloy. And those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it.

## So what do you make of it?
You know damn well what we both make of it.

## No chance it could have been some new kind of test craft?
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.

## Who else could have used that key?
We should sleep in shifts.

## MacReady...?
He's one of them.

## The journey is part of my work.
When do you think it got to him?

## Now how did you get hurt?
I had an accident.

## On the towers?
I'm training to be a high climber.

## And everyone looks like us?
Exactly like you. Well, maybe not as healthy.

## Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
We're not supposed to think about it. But I dream about it sometimes...

## Where?
The Hall of Books.

## What kind of stories?
About the voice in the darkness. About the ghosts...

## What happened?
He came back screaming... He never talked about it after that. I don't think he even got this far.

## This is it?
Around here.

## How did you know?!
1899.

## What are you?
I'm the librarian. I've always been the librarian.

## Sir... have you a name?
But you escaped.

## How have you survived so long?
Regenerating fission reactor, you wouldn't understand. It's power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity.

## Can you show us where they live?
We need your help.

## Excuse me?
You'll live like this forever. Alone. You were meant to help. To be with people. Not like this.

## So, Relic, you want to open Pandora's box, do you? See all the mysteries exposed?
Yes.

## And if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time?
I'm used to that.

## When was his mother taken?
Last night.

## What?
Send him home. You don't want him to see it.

## So, do we go on?
Yes.

## Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
Oh, shut up.

## Yes... Are you sure you want to do this?
Yes. But you've done enough. Thank you for your help... I hope someday people read your books again.

## In for a penny, in for a pound. Do you know that saying?
Yes... Thank you.

## Machines?
Yes.

## Vox?
This way.

## What's it all for?
The air... the power.

## Why did they built it?
The Morlocks didn't build this.

## What do you mean?
Trust me... You don't want to see any more.

## How are your dreams now?
This has to end.

## End...?
This has to end.

## What's your name?
Alexander.

## Created?
You wouldn't understand. We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.

## How do you control the Morlocks?
We make them see what we wish.

## How?
As our bodies atrophied our minds... compensated.

## And what of the Eloi?
They survived above. Became what they are.

## What?
Go back to where you came from. Or die here.

## Why would you let me go back?
Because the past is immutable. Frozen. Dead... And you are the past.

## Say I just come back again?
Alexander, yours is a world of brocade and velvet, not tooth and claw. Why would you come back to this? To save a few cattle? No.

## Why?
We have lost the capacity to reproduce. But the species must continue.

## Now will you go?
No...

## Does this prove something to you? Have you made some great stand of which I'm unaware?
I'm tired of running.

## And why not?
Because...

## God -- could have killed me -- bad girl, Nell! How did you know to do that?
I just love mechanical things.

## You promised me flowers.
May I help you?

## You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember?
Sorry... I was distracted.

## Not here... alone. May we? Please?
What? Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors.

## All right, what is it now?
Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.

## And what do you propose, Professor? Shall we hold a seminar to study the problem?
You know, the moment is rather dying here.

## Alex, what is it?
Holding you... again.

## Alex, what is it?
Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.

## ... The point is I know it will work once the, um, numbers and such are in order.
So it's astronomy now, is it?

## Do you know you were humming?
I was not.

## You know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers.
Tonight's the night?

## Where's the challenge in that?
Alex, this is your first year as an associate professor. You might want to play things a little more conservatively.

## Look at them, Philby, all alike, everyone in an identical bowler hat. Do you want your students to turn out like them?
I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.

## But shouldn't it be better? Shouldn't we be teaching our students to imagine a world beyond all this?
In the future, we'll be better.

## What?
Nothing.

## No, I'm all bowler hat, remember?
Alex, really... good luck tonight. She's a fine girl, and she's done wonderful things for you.

## Oh?
She's gotten into your equations.

## I came by the house every day after the funeral. And then every week. Then every other month. Then I stopped coming. Did you even notice?
I'm sorry, David.

## Then why are you here?
For God's Sake, David --

## That's where you're wrong. I will change it.
Do you find her?

## What is it?
You wouldn't believe me.

## When's the last time you were outside this house -- -- or this room?
I can't leave when I'm so close.

## All right. I'll come for dinner. And in the meantime... you'll think about what we discussed?
In a week... we will never have had this conversation.

## Sir...?
And your jewelry too. I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.

## Yes...
Did you hear me, lad?

## How long did you travel?
Well it seems like a long time -- but it wasn't really. It's rather hard to explain.

## Is there a lot of illness?
Some. But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.

## Your husband is dead?
He's gone to a better place.

## What makes you say that?
You might find the truth rather hard to understand.

## How long ago?
More than 800,000 years.

## I might find the truth rather hard to understand?... Can you go back?
Just a dream. You should sleep too. You're still not well.

## Don't then have stars where you come from?
Not like this... They don't seem so bright with all the city lights. I never really noticed them much...

## All of you?
Every night.

## And this is your \"work\"?
Yes.

## Want to be a high climber now, do you?
It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.

## What's it all for?
I don't understand.

## It has no purpose. It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
Most things. We're very high on purpose.

## What are you?
I'm a planner. I help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like.

## How do you decide?
I try to imagine how they'll look when they're done. I try to imagine how we'll fit in with them... our place in the world.

## Learning was important?
Oh very. Learning, commerce, the arts -- the whole place was buzzing all the time. Night and day.

## Did you have fires at night?
It must have been safe.

## Alexander...?
Orion's belt...

## You know this?
Over there was Fifth Avenue -- and the Plaza Hotel was there... this is... the carriage path. We're on the carriage path.

## Is it?
If you only knew...

## It's undamaged?
Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.

## So you can use it now?
Yes... I suppose so.

## Go back to your own time?
I could...

## Kalen...
Alexander, take my son away. Take him back to your time. Will you do that?

## Hello, Mr. Philby.
Mara...?

## What's the matter with -- ? -- What would I do without you, Mrs. Watchit?
Now that's more like it. You look a proper gentlemen for once.

## Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
Oh, I'm already swooning.

## I see.
Here?

## As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is \"Applied Mathematics and Engineering\", am I correct?
Exactly correct, sir.

## Might I ask why?
Because the assigned curriculum is boring.

## Do they?
My equations are not parlor-tricks!

## What are your people called?
Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.

## We had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago. His name was Moren. Do you know him?
No...

## Why?
To live in. There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.

## Yes. I hope you won't take this the wrong way but is there someone older I could talk to? An elder or patriarch of some kind?
I am the oldest.

## No, I mean someone considerably older. Your father perhaps?
My father has gone to a better place.

## Good morning, Alexander. Feeling up to some work?
I suppose so.

## You won't even try?
We can't change the day and the night, Alexander. This is the world.

## How did you get hurt?
Kalen...

## What's it like where you come from?
We'll see about that.

## I want to see your home. Will you take me?
Kalen, right now you need to go up to bed. You're exhausting Alexander.

## Must be all the exercise I get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb.
You'll tell me more tomorrow?

## I wonder if that poor girl has any idea what she's in for?
For our sake, I hope not.

## And you've no idea where he went?
No, sir.

## Sir?
I'm glad he's gone. Maybe he's finally found a place where he can be happy.

## You ok?
I'm fine.

## What about Starks?
Should we be...

## But the Jacket? I mean...should we be leaving him in like that?
Don't get all worked up, Justin. I expected some common sense on your part and clearly I was expecting too much.  Just open the drawer.

## Well, what are we gonna do about it now?
Well, your condition's pretty serious.

## I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
Depends on what you're seeing.

##  You don't believe me, do you?
I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there.

## In where?
 In that thing...the Jacket.

## They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?
Temporarily.

## My business?
Yes.

## You killed him?
I'll say a prayer for you in Church today, Starks. Maybe the Gods can pick up where the medicine left off.

## You sure you know where to find one?
I've managed to every Sunday of my life.  Some of us are God- fearing men, Starks.

## And what does that mean?
Means we believe in doing his work and fear what the world would be like if we didn't at least try to.

## Becker, how do you sleep at night?
You in here.  Works like a drug.

## Who are you?
I think you know. Your eyes say you do.

##  You're his son?
No. I'm not his son. I'm him.  What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.

## How...how are you here?
You died, Starks. Years ago, in the hospital.

## I know.  You killed me, didn't you?
No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.

## How?
Because...because you came out and said something you couldn't have possibly have known. You came back and repeated three names...

## Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?
It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...

## So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?
The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.

## How did you come to know their names?
You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr. Becker.

## Do I know you from somewhere?
You may have known my father, William Starks.

## Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right?
My father used to talk about you.

## Oh yeah, what'd he say?
Look here, I don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me...

## I didn't.  Did you have anything to do with his death?
He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it.

## What should they be looking for?
They should just be looking harder.

## Where?  It's Becker isn't it? He's doing stuff, isn't he?
Later. I'll tell you about it later. We got a session to catch now.

## You look like you've lost some weight. Are you eating?
I am. One of the few things I remember doing is eating. So I guess I must be exercising it off in my dreams.

## You done with your small talk?
Sure.

##  What do you need me to do?
 Thank you.

## His body was found on January 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died?
No, I don't. I'm sorry. I wish I knew more.

## What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?
Unfortunately, I'm not familiar with Dr. Becker and Dr. Gries passed away three, four years ago.

## Why?
Just do it.

## You two ok?
Our car won't start.

## Your mom take anything before this happened?
Yeah, but I don't know what.

##  What's your name?
Jackie.

## Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
Yeah.

## You're just gonna walk?
Yeah, I'll hitch a ride or something.  Let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel.

## What're those?
Dog tags.  They've got your name and date of birth for identification.

## What for?
 In case you get lost, or can't remember who you are.

## What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.

##  What?
William Starks is dead...  I've been to his grave.

##  What?
His body was found New Year's Day, 19...1993. At Alpine...

## How?
I gave you my dog tags.

## How'd he die?
It's December 25th, 1993 today.

## The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
Yeah.

## What?
I don't know how you got the cut to your head, but you died bleeding from it.

## Do you really believe me?
I don't know.  And when you left, all I wanted was...

##  I want to trust you. Should I trust you?
Yes.

## If they don't take me out before then.  What's the net?
I didn't kill Officer Harrison.

## How? Did they figure it out after I died?
I don't believe a thing she just said.

## Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
I have no idea.

## You think Lorenson kills you?
Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.

## How long do we have?
I don't know.

## You're sure?
Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired M.D.

## What? What are you thinking?
There're no cars on this street.

## I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it?
I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.

## Then why isn't there anyone around?
 I don't know.

## Of course he will.  What day of the week is it?
It's Sunday.

## Where are we going?
To the hospital.

## What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker?
Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through.

## 112 Orchard Way.  You're not coming back, are you?
You gotta stop thinking like that.

## Then, where are you going?
Nowhere.  I just think I'm gonna be sick.

## Good. How's your mom?
Ok, I guess.

## It's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just a cut. We can get it fixed. But we need to get you to the hospital now. How'd you get that?
I fell down.  But I'm alive.

## How you doin'?
I'm doing fine.

## Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?
It's complicated, but  in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.

## How?
He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.

## And if I didn't want to come?
I guess I'd ask you why.

## Why, what would you do?
I could try to...make it stop.

## So it's helping?
You should be careful. You could be killed if they found you out here.

## I never knew my father. Did you?
Yeah, I did.  He was my most memorable patient.

## Why?
At the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things.

## What case?
I was working with a boy named Eugene.

## How'd he get it?
 I don't know.

## How do you know about Dr. Becker?
My dad wrote some things down before he died.

## It's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?
 Yeah, it is.

## What do you mean?
You have no idea what's going on.

## I don't know.  Remember?
Come on. Tell me what you do know.

## Well, what time is it?
2004.

## Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like?
It doesn't look all that different.

## The future doesn't look different?
No. Not for people like me.  Not in the places I come from.

## What about the world?
I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life.

##  Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?
Maybe.

## Why don't you help me?
Because I don't have time.

## Why not?
I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it.

## And how do you know that?
Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.

## How do you know about Eugene?
You told me this was how it happened.

## I did?
Yeah.

## Who...who kills me?
You have nothing to fear, William.

## Who are you kidding, Doc? You or me?
Can I get some paper and something to write with.

## What for?
I'm not gonna let that happen.

## You still don't believe me, do you?
I do believe you...

## Who told you this?
I don't know when it'll happen but soon I think, you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up.

## What are you talking about?
You'll figure it out and you'll do good by him.

## You know how to get there?
Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.

## Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?
TV. Helps numb  Rudy MacKenzie.

## Don't you go to jail for that?
I tried something like 30 times. There is, as STARKS rightly figures, no suitable response to that.

## What were you talking about the other day?
I wasn't talking about anything.

##  How do you know?
The Jacket.

## MacKenzie,  what if we are crazy?
 Everyone does it, don't they? Even Becker. That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3.

## You ever been to jail?
No.

## Where are you going?
I'm going to Canada but I can let you ride with me up to the border.

## Can you drive?
Sure.

## All right.  You got somewhere you need to go, Mister?
I'm not sure.

## You don't have anywhere to stay?
I don't think so.

## Well, where are you from?
I'm not sure.  I don't really know.

## Why \"of course\"?
Well, you definitely didn't pick normal or simple this time either.

## Well, how'd you get here?
 I was dropped off.

## Do you have a motel or something? Money?
No.

## Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?
No.  Not around here.

## Great. That was our last option. What am I going to do with you?
Nothing.  Thanks for bringing me this far.

## What's this?
The best I could do with what was in your fridge.

## You want a drink?
Sure.

## You like it?
 I do it.

##  Why'd you stop?
I don't know, but I think part of it's...

##  Why?
 Real is overrated.

## You don't think that's crazy?
Maybe.  Maybe not.

## So you never knew your mother?
I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew either.

## How?
She fucked herself up day after day and then, one day, she fell asleep with a burning cigarette.  I came home from work and she was gone.

## That when you stopped being a nurse?
Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like that! Haven't I told you I can't stand it when you holler in the morning.

## You want anything special for dinner?
No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what we have for dinner. I may not even make it home for dinner. You know how Fridays are.

## No you won't. You'll be back today. Now! You get your ass back here, Thelma, now, Goddamnit. Thelma, do you understand me?
Darryl.

## What?
Go fuck yourself.

## Do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone?
I could shoot your cousin Eddie.

## Why?
Because he's an inconsiderate asshole.

## I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
I don't know, honey. I guess it would depend.

## On what?
Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids. I'm sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children.

## Who's the nut?
That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.

## Alright! She did good! Didn't she?
Well, son, she's doin' a damn sight better 'n you right now.

## Did either of them ever indicate that they might be running from the Law?
Now that you mention it, they might have been a little bit jumpy.

## Could you identify 'em, if ya saw 'em again?
Hal, I've told you about twenty times, yes, I could identify 'em, but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this.

## Who do you think did it?
Has anybody asked his wife? She's the one I hope did it.

## You didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?
It's a nightclub, not a drive-in, Hal. I don't follow the customers to the parking lot.

## Good. You wanna tell me what happened?
Sure. Maybe over coffee sometime. I'll buy.

## How are things goin' out there?
Weird. Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.

## You're still with us though. You're somewhere on the face of the earth?
Well, we're not in the middle of nowhere, but we can see it from here.

## Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident?
Louise, I'll do anything. I know what's makin' you run. I know what happened to you in Texas.

## Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
That's certainly possible.

## Is this the guy you saw them with?
It's him.

## What kind of gun was it?
A .38.

## Right. Where are they?
We're going to leave someone here at the house in the event that she calls in. Someone will be here until we find them.

## Oh shit.
Get a hold of yourself! You are way out of your jurisdiction, now come on! Calm down! Don't make me sorry I let you come!

## What's wrong?
Stop.

## What for?
I'm spinning.

## So J.D., what are you studying in school?
Human nature. I'm majoring in behavioral science.

## So how come you don't have any kids?
Darryl, that's my husband, he says he's not ready. He's still too much of a kid himself. He prides himself on being infantile.

## Did you get married real young?
Twenty-four isn't young. I'd already been goin' out with him ten years when we got married. I've never been with anybody but Darryl.

## Louise, is that you?
Thelma? It's me.

## I don't know. Nowhere. What are you doin'?
I don't know. Nothin'. Took a shower.

## Oh. I... where's Louise?
She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend.

## What?! Parole officer? You mean you're a criminal?
Well, not anymore, Thelma, except for bustin' parole, I haven't done one wrong thing.

## What did ya do?
I'm a robber.

## You're a bank robber?
Nope. I've never robbed a bank.

## What?
Well, I robbed a gas station once, and I robbed a couple of liquor stores, and some convenience stores. And that's it.

## How?
Well, I was just down on my luck and it seemed like somethin' I was good at so I...

## No, I mean how would you do it? Do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what?
Tell me.

## Jimmy! Hello, stranger. What in the world are you doin' here?
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.

## Who's your friend?
Well, come on, gal, I got you a room. You can go on in and take a nice cold shower.

## Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to.
What the fuck is going on?

## Can't it go to any office?
Tell me now.

## I know. Call me back. Louise, I love you, okay?
Okay.

## Is that how you answer the phone?
I got it. I was afraid I'd missed you. I almost couldn't get a check cashed. It's Saturday.

## Who did it?
Friend of mine, owns a club. Dickie Randall. You'd know him if you saw him. His brother was in your class. Terry.

## Good. That was good. Where do I go?
It's a place called Shaw's Siesta Motel. The address is 1921 North East 23. It's under your name.

## And what's the mysterious code word?
Peaches.

## What?
That's the code word. I miss you, peaches.

## Oh my God! Jimmy! You... Oh my God! What are you doin' here?
Can we get another room? Just put it on my credit card.

## Who is it?
It's me.

## Okay, peaches, okay. But can I ask you one thing?
Maybe.

## Does it have something to do with another guy? Are you in love with him?
It's nothin' like that.

## Can I just ask you one other thing?
Maybe.

## Why now, Jimmy?
Cause, Louise. I don't want to lose you. And for some reason I get the feelin' you're about to split. Permanently.

## Are you just doin' this to punish me?
Believe me, the last thing I want is for you to get punished.

## Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
I'm choking on it.

## You wanna take it out of your wallet, please?
Oh yeah.

## Is this your car?
Yes.

## In the back?
Front.

## Am I in trouble?
As far as I'm concerned, yes, ma'am, you are.

## He already thinks you're out of your mind, Louise, that don't carry much weight with Darryl. Are you at work?
No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.

## What time are you gonna pick me up?
You're kiddin'! Alright! I'll be there around two or three.

## What kind of stuff do I bring?
I don't know. Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains. I guess it gets cold at night. I'm just gonna bring everything.

## In case of what?
In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.

## Whose place is this again?
I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.

## How come he let you go?
Cause I didn't ask him.

## Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.
Isn't this fun?

## Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
So what if he was? It's all your years of waitin' tables has made you jaded, that's all.

## So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine. Asshole.

## Why don't you ditch that loser husband of yours?
West. Left.

## Louise. Where are we going?
I don't know, Thelma! I don't know! Just shut up a minute so I can think.

## Tell them what?! What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
I don't know. Just tell 'em what happened.

## Which part?
Yes.

## It means you don't talk to anybody. You don't draw attention to yourself in any way. Do you understand that?
Our next move? I'll say one thing, Louise. This is some vacation. I sure am having a good time. This is real fun.

## Just what is that supposed to mean?
It means shut up, Thelma.

## Most people just cause me trouble, but that car always gets me out of it.
Just what the hell is wrong with you?

## Did you finish thinking?
I think better when I drive.

## Don't get mad, Louise, but where are we going?
Oklahoma City. Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...

## You talked to him?! Is he mad? Did you tell him?
I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.

## Do you think Darryl's having an affair?
I don't think Darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair.

## Call him?
Call him. Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.

## Will I be?
I don't know. I won't be.

## I don't want to go that way. Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
What did Darryl say?

## Wait. What? You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma and you don't want to go through Texas?
He's got a lot to be proud of.

## So what are you gonna tell him?
Nothing. I'm not gonna tell him a thing. The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.

## Well boy, he's got his work cut out for him now, don't he?
I won't wait up.

## How do I look?
You're a vision, Louise, a goddamn vision of loveliness, you always are.

## What happened to your hair?
Nothing. It got messed up.

## Nothing. Why? Do I seem different?
Yes, now that you mention it. You seem crazy. Like you're on drugs.

## I'm sorry. I am happy. I'm very happy for you. I'm glad you had a good time. It's about time. Where is he now?
Taking a shower.

## You left that guy alone in the room?
Eighty-eight dollars ain't gonna make a dent, baby girl.

## Don't worry about it. You want anything?
Well, I just...

## Oooooweee!! You shoulda seen me! Like I'd been doin' it all my life! Nobody would ever believe it.
Are you sure we should be driving like this? In broad daylight and everything?

## So what's the plan, Thelma? You just gonna stay drunk?
Try to.

## Ugh!! Why do they have to do that?
They think we like it. Maybe they think it turns us on.

## What.
Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone? You think so?

## How'd they find out we're going to Mexico, Thelma, how they know that?
I... I...

## Louise? Where are we?
Just past Boise City.

## Idaho?
Oklahoma, Thelma. We're crossing into New Mexico.

## Whaddo we do?
I'm not suggestin' that! I'm not goin' back. No matter what happens. So don't worry about me.

## Can I ask you kind of a weird question?
Yeah.

## You mean now or before?
Before.

## Those, too, but you know those little hairy ones? Those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth?
Oh yeah. You mean Peek-a-poos.

## Yeah. Those. That always put the fear of God in me. What about you?
Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me.

## Always lookin' on the bright side, aren't ya?
This is so beautiful.

## What?
Nothing. It's not funny.

## About how fast was I going?
I am really sorry about this.

## Ready?
Hit it.

## Louise... are we still going to Mexico?
Yes.

## Yeah, you want it?
Yeah.

## Are you alright?
You know why. You already said.

## I said all that?
No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.

## What do you mean?
You're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you? I mean, I just wanna know.

## Sure... You know how to hotwire a car?
No.

## You awake?
You could call it that. My eyes are open.

## Yes! Yes! Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
It'd have to be pretty good.

## Hey. Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
Texas... You were right about what happened to me there.

## What?
We've gone insane.

## How far are we from Mexico?
About two hundred and fifty miles.

## We probably shoulda filled up the car before we blew up that truck.
How long do you think that'll take?

## You too, sweetie, the best.
Why?

## I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
No... You've always been crazy. This is just the first chance you've had to really express yourself.

## Now what?
We're not giving up, Thelma.

## What are you talkin' about?
Go.

## Go?
You're a good friend.

## What? What are you talkin' about?
You know good and damn well what I'm talkin' about.

## Are you going to apologize or not?
Yeah... sure did.

## What?
BROTHER You heard me. You already put a fucking nick in my piano.

## Well, uh, can you tell us his name?
Jeez, I didn't catch it.

## No harm, no foul?
I guess.

## You sent that?
He implied it.

## Let me ask you this, When you smoke a cigar, do you ever pretend it has balls?
Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.

## What's he like?
You're leaving it out. Finish your swing. You're going to like this one -- she's half Asian, half American.

## Good-looking?
What's the point? Let's face it, Dom, I'm in a slump. Lately I've been feeling like... well... like a loser.

## Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?
I never said that. I'm saying your lucky those kids found his kidneys. Besides, your brother Jimmy never gave a shit about you.

## Each day is better than the next. Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone?
Nah.

## Never?
Well once. Mary.

## Whatever happened to Mary?
I told you, her family moved to Miami.

## Well why don't you look her up?
Yeah, right.

## Why not?
Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single.

## What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
I did try calling her. A few years ago. She wasn't listed.

## So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.

## You're kidding? What did they say?
They told me they don't help out stalkers. Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.

## And you think he could find out her number for me?
Well... at least now you know.

## Christ, Ted, I was only four towns away.
What's so funny?

## What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?
Well think about it.

## No You mean...?
Uh-huh.

## I am?
Yeah feels like it.

## How the hell did you get here anyway?
Flew. Told my wife I was going to a Promise Keepers convention.

## No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over there and do something -- I can't stand watching this.
And this adversely affects me how...?

## Well? What are you waiting for?
I don't know what to say.

## Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?
Got cash.

## Car clean? Plenty of gas?
Check.

## Mints?
Copped a tin of Altoids at the car wash.

## Hm?
You know, clean the pipes.

## Pipes? What are you talking about?
You jerk off before all big dates, right? Tell me you jerk off before your big dates.

## Think about it, After you've had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed, are you nervous?
No.

## Why's that?
I'm usually too tired to be.

## Dom? What are you?
You stole her from me. Now I want her back.

## Uh-huh. Where was he?
Out getting coffee.

## Who?
Mary.

## A convention? How'd you see her at a convention?
I'm an orthopedic surgeon, she's an orthopedic surgeon.

## Who?
Big guy -- goes to Barrington high school.

## Oh come on, why would I lie?
Because you're a loser, and in some warped way this gives you a momentary sense of worth.

## Thanks.
That right?

## You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.

## Stalker, huh?
Big time.

## Yeah, and you don't drink any less, right?
Take it easy, that's Bill.

## This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer?
No I can't.

## Am I?
Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.

## Sully, it's Healy. What's going on over there?
Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary girl I told you about.

## The sawbones?
Yep.

## Why didn't you just tell her the truth?
But Jesus, Pat, if she's as special as you say, she's going to want to hear about the things you did.

## I'm gonna get a soda, you want one?
No thanks.

## Nepal? Have you been?
Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.

## You own a home there?
Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.

## Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops?
Not 'til you get about three hundred yards from the summit. That's been my experience anyway.

## By the way, what's your name?
Pat Healy.

## Don't you want to know my name?
I already know it, Mary.

## How'd you know that?
It's right there on your golf bag.

## What are you doing with all these blueprints?
Some buildings I'm working on.

## Are you... an architect?
Well, just until I get my PGA Tour card.

## What's that?
I work with retards.

## I beg your pardon?
You know... ...the guys who ride the short bus.

## Isn't that a little politically incorrect?
The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me who I can and can't work with.

## Oh, Pufferball likes his little tum- tum rubbed, doesn't he now?
Wow, I've never seen him like this. He doesn't usually like guys.

## Sorry, Pat, out of beer. You like vodka?
Great.

## The museum? I thought we were going out to dinner?
We will, but first I have a surprise.

## A surprise?
The architecture exhibit! My friend Tucker is going to be here. He's an architect, too. You guys will have tons to talk about.

## Is this one art deco or art nouveau?
Deco.

## Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
That...? Vestibule.

## How about -- ?
When you look at architecture, try not to concern yourself with the pieces -- look at the building in its totalitarianism.

## And it doesn't cramp your style?
Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.

## Lint?
Yeah, I think it's that dog of hers running around on the rug all day -- just makes for a lot of lint. Look at this...

## Why bounce when you have your own condo in Nepal to go to?
Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new place, quit the architect game, slow things down, read more books, see more movies...

## You're a movie buff?
Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.

## Have you seen it?
No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.

## Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?
I guess.

## What?
No, forget it, it was stupid.

## Come on, what were you going to say?
Nah, really, it was moronic.

## You look great. Hey, Mare, do I have a rip in the back of these pants?
Sure.

## Who the hell's Woogie?
Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're a murderer.

## All you want is a phone number?
Well, I know you're busy...

## Ted, I'm the kind of guy who shoots from the hip. Now I want you to level with me, Did you knock this skirt up?
No.

## She's blackmailing you, right?
No.

## You want her dead, don't you?
You can't be serious.

## Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case?
I'm not a stalker! She's a friend of mine.

## Really? Very, very?
I think your life's about to change.

## So you found Mary?
Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something.

## That I couldn't say. Let me ask you something, Was she a little big-boned in high school?
No, not at all.

## Mary's a little chubby, huh?
I'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half. Not bad.

## So she's married?
Nope. Never been.

## Huh?
Four kids, three different guys.

## Three different guys?
It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...

## Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
Oh, uh, I resigned.

## Miami?
Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.

## Jai alai?
Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at home in the fronton.

## But you said she was a sparkplug...?
I said buttplug. She's heinous.

## Japan? What's she doing in Japan?
You've heard of mail-order brides? Well they go that way, too.

## Mary's a mail-order bride?
Answer the question, shitball.

## Do what?
Turn her over to a stalker.

## Oh Christ... poor dog.
What?! You're calling me a stalker?

## You're a sick man, you know that?
Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand the fact that it was my turn.

## Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a letter outlining our deal?
Why the fuck would I do that? I'd be screwing myself.

## Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.

## Harvard?
You bet.

## Did you study under Kim Greene?
Among others.

## Did you build the Estadio Olympico?
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.

## I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
Uh, sort of nouveau Deco... with a big vestibule. Check it out next time you're up there.

## Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker?
Okay, Pat, take it easy -- don't do anything stupid.

## You what?
You heard me, goddamnit. I... I love her.

## Bullshit!
What do you mean?

## How'd you manage that one?
Friend. Baseball bat.

## How many is that?
Four.

## That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
I never said that.

## What?
I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You probably did it yourself, you piece of shit.

## Don't flatter yourself -- I was following her, I always do. How the hell you think I got rid of Mary's boyfriend Steve?
Oh... Sully.

## Look, if it wasn't you who sent the letter, and it wasn't me who sent it?
Thanks for picking me up.

## Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.

## Hm?
That right? Good for you.

## Yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea -- it's a home run. You ever hear of Eight-Minute Abs?
The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V.

## Yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy halfway to Katmandu.
How do you guarantee that?

## What's that supposed to mean?
It means you're too hard on guys.

## Have you been up all night again?
Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.

## Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
These ain't strangers, they're neighbors. This only picks up signals in a half-mile radius.

## Meaning?
You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta move.

## So who's the lucky guy?
Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.

## Good lookin'?
He's no Steve Young.

## What's he like?
I don't know. He's kind of a mook.

## What's a mook?
You know, a mookalone, a schlep.

## Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
Come on, Magda It's like that movie Harold and Maude.

## Sure. Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers...?
Oh, yeah, of course, dear.

## Bundt cake?
Must have a sweet tooth. See if you can find some cookies.

## Hey hey, what did you say Pat's last name was?
Healy.

## Why?
Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.

## An old flame?
Kind of. Ted Peloquin -- one of the sweetest guys in the world.

## You vicious bitch, how do you sleep at night?
I can't do it -- I just found out it's his birthday. I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted.

## Where's Puffy?
Ah, he was being a pest so I put him in the bathroom.

## Hey, no kidding? Where are your offices?
Pat does projects all over the world.

## You don't think they're too big?
No no, the bigger the better. But I must say, they could be a little brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites.

## That's what you've been looking for -- a farter?
I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.

## Can I pour you one?
Thanks, but I've got to be going. Unfortunately, Doc, this isn't a social visit.

## What's up?
Well... I've got a little more news about your friend Healy.

## What...?
I can't believe this is happening. I'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.

## You mean he's not a criminal?
Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my folks.

## Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt yourself?
No, it's an old football injury.

## Oh, are you on the team?
No, a couple of the players and me were joking around and, uh, I fell off the school.

## The prom -- you going?
Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty dumb.

## Are you all right?
Oh yeah.

## Ted, are you okay?
Just a minute.

## Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.
Ted, I'm so sorry. Are you going to be okay?

## And did everything -- ?
Oh yeah, healed right up. No visible scars.

## By the way, how's he doing?
He's dead.

## Oh. So... what brings you down here?
Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of mine decided to... ah... you know... just... drive down.

## Well you look great. Are you married, do you have kids?
Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets. God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.

## I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but the thing is I already have plans. How about tomorrow night?
Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years. Don't make me wait another day.

## Hm?
On your ear, you've got something.

## Now by killer, you mean...?
I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.

## What are you?
Twenty-two.

## Yeah?
We've got a lot in common.

## So you're a writer?
Trying to be.

## What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
...and then it was all over. We haven't spoken since.

## Yeah... almost. You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?
Uh no. I think I'm gonna get out while I'm ahead.

## Why not?
That's really sweet, Ted, but you should save it for one of your books.

## What did you think, Ted? That you could spy on me and trick me into thinking you were someone I could... really go for?
Mary, I swear I wasn't trying to trick you.

## Then what the fuck did you do it for?
I did it because because I'd never stopped thinking about you and if I didn't find you I knew my life would never be good again.

## Ted...?
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.

## But but what about Steve?
Oh yeah, that'd make golf real fun -- the guy doesn't even drink beer or gamble.

## Really?
Really.

## Yeah? What do you want?
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.

## What seems to be the situation here? You shit yourself or something?
I wish.

## You got what stuck?
It.

## Is it the frank or the beans?
I think a little of both.

## How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that?
I don't know. It's not like it was a well thought-out plan.

## Everything okay here? Neighbors said they heard a lady scream.
Just relax, dear. Now, um... what exactly are we looking at here?

## Is that bubble what I think it is?
Well, there's only one thing to do.

## So what's up?
Eh.

## Okay. So is that a yes or a no?
I think I was very clear, Ted. If everything else falls apart, maybe.

## We're here, Warren. You wanna get off?
Giddy-up.

## Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
I'm gonna take a rain check.

## Huh...?
See you, Warren.

## What are you doing?
Carrying out our mission, Mr. Secretary. If you don't mind, we're very busy right now. We need to be able to do our jobs.

## This private assurance represents the word of the Highest Authority?
Yes.

## Did you have any indication of this from Georgi? Any possible warning or sense of motivation?
He's right, Jack. Taylor is saying we may have some time. We've got to use it.

## What if I can't?
Well, I'm not.

## Then you'll call, right?
Goddamn Stevenson. Jesus. Peace at any price. You'd think nobody learned anything from World War Two.

## That's all well and good, but what do we say to 'em?
We were just debating who had it worse, us or George Washington and his guys.

## He's right. And things are happening too fast. It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again.
How does a guy get a rep like that?

## What happened to speak when spoken to?
Give it a rest. You were thinking the same thing, just didn't have the guts to take the heat.

## What's gotten into you?
Oh, still sore about this.

## And?
So now you've got to talk him out of it. And then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution.

## We gave so much to get here. I don't know. Sometimes I think what the hell did we do it for?
Because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else.

## Slow down. Smell that?
Smoke.

## Yeah?
Kenny. It's over.

## What's it about?
Cuba.

## What did you think of Lippman's column this morning?
I think it's a bad idea.

## This is from the Highest Authority?
Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.

## And the second condition?
Time is of the essence.

## John. How much time?
48 hours. In 48 hours there can be no deals.

## Is this the Chiefs' recommendation?
Yes, sir. Our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational. The invasion happens eight days later.

## How long until the army is ready?
We've just begun the mobilization under cover of a pre-arranged exercise, sir. We're looking at another week and a half, Mr. President.

## Guess we can't blame Khruschev for a few patriotic farmers. And the ships?
Still heading for Cuba.

## So which one of you geniuses can tell me how to explain ourselves to the world? How do we work with them if there's been a hard-line coup?
Mr. President, there is another possibility we haven't considered. This may not be a coup at all.

## Does this attack on our plane represent a definitive, intentional escalation on the part of the Soviets?
Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about Kevin. You need to do something about this.

## What's happened?
What happens to you? I'm not leaving without you.

## A thing like this... who could even think of winning?
I saw you out there. You want him to call you back, need you.

## How's my favorite President?
Busy. But you've got his heart.

## It's Tuesday. You said to call. When do I get my 45 minutes?
Tell you what. We're in Connecticut tomorrow for Ribicoff. I'll get you up front with him during the flight.

## Hey, sport. You winning?
Yeah.

## What about you? Where are you going?
Back to work.

## So what've we got today?
Today, for your information, is Pulaski Day. We're going to Buffalo...

## Still think Cuba isn't important?
Not as far as the election goes.

## Have you canceled Chicago and the rest of the weekend yet?
You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.

## What about these low-level flights? They're starting in what? An hour? Do you realize what you're letting yourself in for?
We need those flights. We have to know when those missiles become operational, because when they do, we need to destroy them.

## How does a man get to a place where he can say, 'throw those lives away,' so easily?
That's going to be tough. You know how these guys are about their chains of command...

## What's that?
Oh, just a bunch of crap about withdrawing our Jupiter missiles in Turkey if the Soviets'll do the same in Cuba.

## Sleep is for the weak, Mr. President.
Hello?

## Bob, is there any way we can avoid stopping a submarine first?
Captain, force the sub to the surface for inspection.

## Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- Larry. That's not even your name, is it? What's your real name, you fucking scumbag?
I thought we were staying on the reservation.

## FBI? What you investigatin'?
A murder. On the reservation.

## James Looks Twice?
That's right. What are you doing here? This is a religious ceremony you're desecrating.

## What's this about?
Levoi, Cooch. Raymond Levoi, Criminal Division.

## Sioux Indian, right?
Ray, there's been a homicide out in an area known as The Badlands. Indian Reservation.

## Taking ol' Leo somewhere?
Leo's been out here too long, man. I'm taking him to ceremonial burial.

## Nice piece. You come back here to cover your tracks, Geronimo? What's your name?
It ain't Geronimo.

## Who are you?
I think maybe you guys got off the wrong exit, yeah? This is the Bear Creek Indian Reservation.

## We got the wire ya was comin'. You're the Indian official, yeah?
No. No, that's Ray, here. Ray, uh... Ray... Little Weasel.

## What journey?
Tell him, Ray.

## South Dakota... Did I do something unsatisfactory, Sir?
No, Ray. You're gonna have to blame that on your grandmother.

## No. I consulted it. We're going into Indian Country, I wanna know what kind of individual is covering my ass. Don't you?
Six rounds. 357.

## Who the fuck is he?
-- a fucking cop.

## Keeping of the souls. Do they still burn their dead or something?
Beats the hell outta me.

## How'd you know?
I got one up on ya.

## Who is he?
One of the leaders of the Warriors of All Red Nations. Militant organization.

## What'd she say?
She took something from the house. What she called a medicine bundle. Most likely Jimmy's.

## Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
Her oil pan is shot.

## Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
Jesus, I don't know. You tell me. You're the Indian.

## Cooch. Where the fuck did they send us?
A long way from home. You be careful out there.

## She's that subtle?
Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.

## -- never mind Eagle Bear. We've got Jimmy nailed. Let's go!
Jesus, you alright?

## Why?
-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...

## Let the press through.
We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?

## I said when can Leo be taken to ceremony?
After we've completed our investigation.

## You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?
Is that right? Well, listen to this, drag your ass. This is a restricted area.

## Is that right? What are the trees saying today?
He sent me to find ya. He says he's got information.

## What did he say?
He wants to know if you ever watch the Cookie Monster. He says the Cookie Monster is not to be trusted -- a trickster.

## He knows me?
He says he saw you in a vision some time ago.

## What's he smoke in that?
Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe. That's a white man's myth. This is a sacrament.

## What did he say?
He said he doesn't know.

## What was he saying?
Why should I tell you.

## So what?
The owl is a messenger. When one shows itself to a Sioux... it means someone's gonna die. The owl told him about Leo.

## Jimmy didn't do it, Ray. I checked it out. You can stop taggin' my sister.
He also said \"listen to the water.\"

## That's not solid.
She's your sister?

## The old man? He's gonna tell you who killed Leo?
Go catch Jimmy, Ray. Really. He's gettin' away. Go ahead, go get him. I'm late.

## A what?
Red Deer Table, Ray.

## -- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man.
Walter. When I fill out my 302, do I say that evil spirits are killing everybody on the reservation?

## What'd you expect to hear?
Not Native American myths and legends. I'm with the FBI, Walter, remember? Not National Geographic.

## Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in here, Man.

## Cuz I'm a skin?
Cuz you're a cop.

## What are you talking about?
And I don't give a goddamn about whether you wear a badge or not, Crow Horse, but I didn't cut you.

## Still after Jimmy?
They found prints at Blue Legs' place.

## You think you was sent here cuz you're a good cop?
No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian. And a good cop.

## Why? So you can get rid of me, too?
No. So we can do what the old man said. Red Deer Table, Walter. We have to go.

## Do they come in dreams, these visions?
Oh yeah. Dreams. Sometimes durin' sickness. Vision quest. Sweat Lodge. Ya never know when.

## At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where I was, and that's where the dream was. Why?
Nothin'. Forget it.

## Maybe it was just a dream. Ya know, just one of them, what do ya call 'em, fitful dreams?
Yeah. Fitful dreams.

## What's that?
Ain't prayer flags, that's for sure.

## Jesus. Oil?
Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry.

## What?
That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium.

## This Clear Moon's house?
Yeah. It's time to beat the drum. You better wait here. He don't trust the white man.

## They got us sealed. What are we gonna do?
We're going for The Stronghold.

## Some Indian time?
I'll have to see what the visions say about that one.

## This Jimmy's?
You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.

## Who did?
A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine.

## I desecrated it?
Your relatives must've taught you something.

## What?
Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.

## Come back?
Never mind.

## What are you doing on the reservation?
I'm on my way back in. Over.

## Do you want a coffee?
No. No, no. Thank you.

## Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it?
Since I got a iron pipe put across my knees, man. Fight with three wasi'cus, ya know.

## No. Can't say that I have, Richard. Richard do you know why I'm here?
Washington sent ya. I know that.

## What the fuck you talkin' about?
What the fuck, man? What do you people want? I did what you wasi'cu's told me to do.

## I blew his back out with a buffalo gun, that's how I know! Now you're gonna say I didn't, so you can throw me back in solitary?
The men who came to see you at Leavenworth. The one's who made the arrangement... who were they? Maybe I can talk to them.

## Miles. Three other suits. That's all I know 'em as -- suits. Were you there?
Keep talking, Yellow Bird...

## It isn't?
Well, it is. It is that, too.

## How so?
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.

## And on to a bigger one with you?
Yeah, most likely.

## Was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?
I heard of one once.

## How did you know this was my car?
Simple deduction. It's fast. It's pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's your color...matches your lipstick.

## Why not?
I saw one.

## You saw a MiG 21?
I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.

## Where did you see that?
It's classified.

## It's what?
It's classified. Like Hollywood says, I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.

## Not in this case. CHARLIE You saw a MiG push negative 4G?
Yes, ma'am.

## Where were you?
On his six.

## He was in a 4G Negative dive and you were on his six?
Yes, ma'am, At first. Then I was directly above him.

## If you were directly above him, how did you see him?
I was inverted.

## The what?
You know. The finger.

## You seemed determined to do that anyway.. Why didn't you tell me you were a famous MiG insulter? MAVERICK Would it have made a difference?
No.

## What would?
What would you say, too fast...too quick...

## For what?
That stuff about the MiG. I was out of line.

## Is that all? CHARLIE What else do you want?
Um. You.

## Too aggressive?
I don't mix with the boys. I work here. Let's keep it professional.

## What are you talking about?
You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.

## What if he's not?
You have to shoot him down....If he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens.

## How about what?
How about anything, anything you want to do.

## What about the plane?
What plane.

## Used to what?
I'm different.

## Make what?
Anything.

## Why'd you do that?
It dies. We live.

## That's true. What are you?
I don't enjoy watching things suffer.

## You ever think about killing another human being?
About as much as they think about killing me.

## Does it bother you?
You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.

## Are you really that brave?
It's just as I thought.

## What?
You're totally insane.

## You want to go ballistic?
I don't know. I don't like being out of control.

## And now?
And now I want you.

## You always get what you want?
I don't know yet.

## Why?
Well no...inverse order.

## You ever fly an F-14?
I don't fly in anything that doesn't show movies.

## Why, what's gonna happen?
Lucky charm.

## Pawn shop. What's to eat?
...they say you're alright.

## The dark side. The price you pay for all the fun you're having. You knew about it, of course. Didn't you?
He was a friend of mine. A good guy...great guy. It was my fault.

## Do what, show you a good time?
I'm not good company. I should be alone.

## What do you want?
I want it back.

## What?
Yesterday.

## What do you do when you come here?
I sit. I think. I play games.

## What kind of games?
I like to play \"reality\".

## Strip reality! How do you play that?
You're crazy. That's a pretty silly game.

## What truth?
The big one. The one that's most on your mind.

## Now?
Take something off.

## Off me or off you?
That's up to you.

## Looks like a tie.
What does it mean?

## Who's gonna win?
We'll say it together. On the count of three...One...two...

## You weren't gonna say goodbye?
I was, later.

## How could you?
...Something like that.

## Yes sir. I do, Sir.
Well?

## Well?
Sir. I was going Mach point one five.

## Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?
F-14's sir.

## Lieutenant... Is there... a Russian attack?
No sir! But you have to be ready.

## Yes, Sergeant?
Remember one thing.

## Sir?
Outside of this gate... I...am Top Gun.

## WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
Maintaining course. Straight for Mustang.

## WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
EVERYBODY'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE. ..NOW WE'RE RIGHT WITH YOU. YOU ARE INVERTED. ROLL IT, COUGAR.

## YEAH, COUGAR?
These guys are getting on my nerves.

## WHAT? WHERE'RE YOU--HEY, WHERE IN THE HELL ARE YOU GOING?
DIDN'T ... AHHH...LOOK GOOD.

## WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT?
NO. NO GOOD.

## What are you doing?
Saving them some paperwork.

## Goddamnit, Mav, you really are a slow learner. Don't worry, Fung, I've got it.
Since when did you care about paperwork?

## Don't WORRY!!!? You've GOT it!!? Are you CRAZY?
Roger, I've got it.

## Now have you got it? Have you still got it?
Yawing right.

## Is there something I should know?
Just relax.

## Is it the plane?
The plane is fine.

## MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK, REQUEST A FLYBY.
Is it you?

## Why do they call you Wolf?
Well, I don't know. That depends.

## On what?
Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.

## Like what?
Oh...I'll think of something.

## Did what?
Got you here.

## Below the hard deck doesn't count. You guys are the second team, aren't you?
Slider -- they let you into Top Gun? If you're among the best in the Navy, I tremble for the security of this country.

## Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
The list is long, but distinguished.

## Who's your pilot?
Tom Kazansky.

## How was it?
Could use a dash more jet fuel.

## Nothing...That's McGown...that's Singer, isn't it? GOOSE Turn around, pay attention. What are you doing?
Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew him at Pensacola. He's damn good.

## Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
Gotta keep track of the competition.

## Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't believe a word I say. Tell her I'm married, will you?
Yeah, he's married--but then again, he,s not dead.

## What do these guys think, I made Cougar quit?
Pay no attention to it. They're just trying to rattle you. It's all psychological. Sit down..and drink.

## Ahhh...A little high on the left, don't you think?
Just once, if they take your plane away.

## What?
Come on, I got over six bucks on the line.

## What the hell is this?
Don't chew it, you won't have it that long. Easier to clean the cockpit if it comes up in big chunks.

## Something bothering you?
Nothing. Let's just go fight.

## No shit! That why they call him Ice?
Man, you guys gooned it. Your laser butts are scattered across KANSAS.

## What'd you do?
It's not the plaque. The winner can get assigned here as instructor. He gets to fight every day.

## The girl with the purple fingernails?
That's her--tall hungry woman with fire in her eyes. It was great.

## What now?
GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE.

## I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF A SHOT?
Who is the best.

## Need a hint?
I think I can work it out on my own.

## The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. Jester, at what point did you call off the fight?
Just below ten thousand.

## Who's the hell is that?
Three guesses.

## COUGAR, THIS IS MAVERICK. I'M GETTING HUNGRY, LET'S HEAD FOR THE BARN. ...COUGAR, WHERE ARE YOU?
I...FORGOT SOMETHING.

## What the hell you doing?
It was bad.

## Bad?
The girl with the purple fingernails was Coogan's sister.

## No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me?
Morning, Coogan.

## How's it goin', Coog?
He's a good pilot.

## Sir?
That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...

## Maverick... Where'd you get that call sign?
Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.

## Why?
We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.

## The rules of engagement are not flexible. They exist for your safety. You will obey them. Is that clear?
I wasn't thinking. I just did it.

## Then why are you here?
For the same reason you are.

## How do you feel?
All right.

## She said you took your kid to the each. Every second Sunday. Zoo or beach or the ballgame. Y'have the option... What about me?
Or....

## What's wrong with this one?
He ain't got five kids to feed.

## Where's yours?
Over there man.

## What to the rebels want?
Oh, the usual. More money, more freedom, more air.

## So, where to?
The Last Resort.

## First time on Mars?
Freaks?...'Fraid so, man. Goes with the territory.

## What happened to them?
Cheap domes. And no air to screen out the rays.

## Why not?
I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...

## Lemme ask you a question. Ever fuck a mutant?
Take me to the hotel.

## Hey, I got four kids to feed.
What happened to number five?

## What do you want?
They've got you bugged, and they'll be busting down the door in about three minutes unless you do exactly what I say.

## Who are you?
Never mind. Wet a towel and wrap it around your head. That'll muffle the signal.

## How'd you find me?
I'd advise you to hurry.

## Would you like the same suite?
Definitely.

## Identification?
I'll go encode your room key.

## May I use your pen?
Well, my boy, you're a hero.

## So why am I still alive?
We gave you lots of help. Benny here...

## Who is it this time--my mother?
The guy's a fucking asshole.

## Do you expect me to believe you?
Who gives a shit what you believe? In thirty seconds, you'll be dead. Then I'll blow this place up...

## Richter, do you know why I'm such a happy person?
No, sir.

## What is it?
You better get down here.

## Why not?
We haven't implanted it yet.

## Two-headed monsters?
Don't you keep up with the news? We're doing alien artifacts now.

## So, been married long?
Eight years.

## Your sexual orientation?
Hetero.

## Blonde, brunette, redhead?
Brunette.

## Slim, athletic, voluptuous?
Demure, aggressive, sleazy? Be honest.

## What do you want?
This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.

## Amazing. Where are we?
At Rekall.

## How much is Cohaagen paying you for this?
Bullshit. It's all coincidence.

## What about the girl? Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified. Is that a coincidence?
She's real. I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.

## Suppose I do...then what?
Swallow this.

## What is it?
It's a symbol. Of your desire to return to reality. --Inside your dream, you'll fall asleep.

## Any news of Quaid?
Not since you lost him.

## We don't have much choice then, do we?
Sit down.

## Where's Kuato?
On his way.

## You heard the rumors about the Pyramid Mine?
Yeah.

## What, aliens?
You tell me.

## You're Kuato, right?
They sell fake memories.

## \"RekallRekallRekall.\" You thinkin' of goin' there?
I don't know. Maybe.

## Why not?
Yeah, you did. I told you not to but you did anyway.

## What are you, my father?
Let me buy you a drink.

## Harry, what the hell is this?
Come on, let's go have that drink.

## Where?
Up to the right.

## Are you saying she liked it?
I'm sure she hated every fuckin' minute of it.

## Where is he?
That son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere.

## What the hell is this?
I'm sorry. Would you please rephrase the question.

## Thanks for taking Johnnycab.
Welcome to JohnnyCab. Where can I...?

## Is that better?
Mmmm.....

## Who?
Nobody.

## Nobody?! What's her name?
I don't know.

## ...You mean it?
You know I do.

## Yeah, sweetheart?
Let's do it.

## Do what?
Move to Mars.

## And you believe him?
All right, forget about it.

## Well...What do you say?
I'm late.

## Sweetheart...I know it's hard being in a new town, but let's at least give it a chance here. Okay?
Lori, don't you understand? I feel I was meant for something more than this. I want to do something with my life.--I want to be somebody.

## Harry from work...He was the boss.
What are you doing?

## Take it easy. Tell me exactly what happened? Why would \"spies\" want to kill you?
It was implanted by the Agency.

## And falling in love?
Implanted.

## Our friends, my job, eight years together, I suppose all this was implanted too?
The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up.

## O.K. then. If I'm not me, then who the hell am I?
Beats me. I just work here.

## Doug...You wouldn't shoot me, would you? After all we've been through?
Yeah. Some of it was fun.

## That a problem?
I'm not interested in Saturn. I said Mars.

## How real does it seem?
As real as any memory in your head.

## What about the guy you lobotomized...Did he get a refund?
You're talking ancient history, Doug. Nowadays, traveling with Rekall is safer than getting on a rocket. Look at the statistics.

## Whatever you say...Just answer one question. What is it that is exactly the same about every vacation you've ever taken?
I give up.

## Secret agent...How much is that?
Go on.

## I love you.
They'll be here any minute! They'll kill you all!

## Ooo, whatcha been feeding that thing?
Blondes.

## ...What?
There's something I have to tell you...

## What are you talking about?
I don't remember you. I don't remember us. I don't even remember me.

## What, did you get amnesia?...How'd you get here?
Hauser left me a note.

## Wait, did you say wife?...Are you fuckin' married!!?
She wasn't really my wife.

## Why would I lie to you?
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.

## Inside what?
I think you better leave.

## I used to model for 'em, why?
Just wondering.

## What can I do?
Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.

## Like what?
All sorts of things. You might even remember you loved me.

## Oh, since when?
He's lying.

## Where's this \"reactor\" come from?
It's just up ahead.

## I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream?
Then kiss me quick...before you wake up.

## I gave you?
Ready as we'll ever be.

## Okay, Burt, listen. Forget shooting them. Tell me this, can you get to your truck?
No problem.

## Breaker there, Earl. What do you want us to do?
Hang on, Burt. The bastards are up to something.

## What the hell is that, anyway?
Cannon fuse.

## What do you use it for?
My cannon.

## Burt, can you hear me now?
Well, we'll ask around. Let you know if we hear of anything.

## Jesus Christ...think it smells like that 'cause it's dead?
No. We go straight.

## Could we make it to the mountains?
Where the hell are they? Hope they didn't wise up.

## You bet. You gonna be staying up here?
Well, yeah! There's going to be major research up here. First thing is to get some pictures of that one we dug up.

## You didn't cook breakfast?
Did it yesterday. Franks and beans.

## How many cows does it take to make a stampede? Is it like three or more? Is there a minimum speed?
If there was one nearby I'd probably ask him.

## Who the hell's that? That's not what's his name...the grad student?
Nah, it's September. Must be the new one.

## What the hell do we know about seismographs?
Nothing. But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.

## Why?
Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z...

## You gotta ask that?
So what if we just did it...today. Pack up. Drive straight down to Bixby. Get serious.

## I'll call that little bluff. How close?
Uh oh, it's Nancy. She wants another load of firewood.

## If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?
Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...

## You want the rifle or the Smith?
The rifle.

## Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from?
Here's the plan...We don't even stop. Ride like hell. Tonight we keep right on going. We'll walk the horses.

## We'll take your word for it.
That is the plan...I mean, goddamn it! What the hell are those things? How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon?

## Yeah. Where's your truck?
Prairie dog burrow...

## Okay, now, how far's your truck?
I don't know. If this one's any faster than that other one...

## Maybe it is. Why don't you take a little stroll and see?
It's been listening to us. It's got no eyes. It sure as hell can't smell anything underground, so I figure...

## Well, folks, what's the plan?
First let's see if Stumpy's still out there.

## Don't he have a home to go to?
Well, that's why Edgar never got down off that tower.

## How the hell long it take you to change a tire?
Just about too damn long. Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway.

## Wait a minute...the Cat. Could we take the Cat?
Jesus. It's slower than hell.

## Come on, you're not going to do your lasso thing...?
Hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope...

## Fine, make the mistakes I did. I think I'll just be playing this hand myself.
Somebody paying you to do this?

## What?
She likes both of us. We both helped her out.

## How's she doing?
She wants to lay down. I'm a little worried.

## We playing cards tonight?
I think I'm gonna be sitting up with her.

## Hi, guys, what you been up to?
Ran into the new college student, Rona.

## What?
That's the sky that's going to be over our roof every night, when we're done.

## You sure this is where it was?
Twenty.

## Around here? Why would they?
Yeah. But I'll tell you, if you ever wanted proof God is a man, this is it.

## Think it's still following us?
Let's assume that it is.

## Ready?
Yeah. One, two, three...

## Why do you all keep asking me?
Please... I need to sleep...

## Demerol? What the fuck is your problem, man? You wanna die?
I'm dead. We're both dead.

## ...Where're we goin'?
That-a-boy. Hospital.

## The photo on the left shows the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin, true?
True.

## And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun?
Correct.

## You would have the court believe that these two bullets were fired from the same gun?
Absolutely.

## Or this -- is this a significant difference?
No it is not, Mr. Dowd.

## Forensic ballistics isn't an exact science, is it?
It most certainly is.

## Isn't there a ten to fifteen-percent margin of error?
Absolutely not. No more than seven percent.

## The hell you do. At this hour?
Gimme back my bottle.

## -- Then you don't wish to call any witnesses, Mr. Dowd?
You can't come back here... Anything happens to you I'm liable.

## Look, I'm a lawyer and --
Do you see a toilet here you think is really me?

## \"We\"?
I had a minute before the Mapp hearing -- but I couldn't get you on the phone, Eddie...

## Not necessarily...
No it's not the only issue. There's another issue, for the jury. What about entrapment?

## Come now. Did you see the gun?
I can describe it.

## Oh really?
It was silver, with a stubby barrel... snub-nosed, I think they call it... It wasn't automatic, it had one of those... cylinders...

## No further questions.
How can you remember that?

## Exactly what information led you to arrest my client just two-and-a-half hours after the shooting took place?
We had a description of the suspect.

## A \"description\"? What, Asian male 18 to 30, black hair, brown eyes?
We had information bearing on Mr. Kim's desire to gain admission into the Joe Boys by assassinating a member of a rival gang.

## You see that? You wanna be like that?
No. No...

## Where?
Ossining Correctional Facility. Sing Sing. Everybody's innocent there, man... Just ask 'em...

## -- The Nazi he knifed?
At the trial, you said you were at your apartment that night. Alone.

## ...So what would we claim? He stabbed Duane Lindeman in self-defense?
With two knives taped to his hands? Forget it, Rog.

## What other case?
Eight years ago. The Chinatown hit.

## You really think that's what happened?
I don't know but it makes one hell of an opening statement.

## -- Easy as that, huh?
Easy? No... We have to find some piece of evidence that got buried, to reopen the sucker.

## When did you start working for the goddam D.A.?
Eddie... I don't know about this...

## Eddie... What's a DD-5?
That DD-5.

## Do you have to do that?
\"Have to\"? No...

## -- You found his mugshot?
They're just frightened, fucked-up losers that prison fucked up worse.

## A fucking wheelchair?
A spinal injury, in the line of duty. It was in Kitty's report...

## Goddam it... the little punk bests me again, I get thrown down and lectured at and where the hell were you?
1530 Rivington Street.

## -- What?
Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.

## ...What do you mean?
Well, I mean, Roeder's gone, now... A dead end. Believe me, I'm sorry too, but...

## Let's get a cab.
But what?

## You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?
I followed her from the courthouse.

## -- What?
I've seen this picture before.

## How long did it take Badalato to drive Jimmy Chin's body from Chinatown to the morgue?
... An hour. That's why I thought the morgue was on the other side of town.

## You're the police expert in Chinatown gangs?
...For ten years, now.

## Do you speak Cantonese, Mandarin, or both?
-- Me? Neither.

## Pardon... Which dialect do you speak?
Neither.

## You're doing a murder case?
It hasn't been that long.

## Just which Constitutional amendment protects our right to peddle PCP?
Forget it. You've blown your chance to participate in this case, Kitty.

## \"Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators...\"?
I embroidered.

## \"...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed Jimmy Chin\"?
I lied.

## A fucking wheelchair?
Eddie, these things take time. Particularly at this hour...

## Got any booze in the house?
You don't drink \"booze\".

## My mother find you?
That's right.

## Want to tell me what went down here?
Racist asshole came at me.

## Exactly what happened then?
I killed the motherfucker.

## But why would a guy would do that? Paint black teardrops on his face?
I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.

## But why?
Maybe... because someone's afraid.

## Afraid of what?
I don't know. The truth, maybe.

## -- About what?
About Chinatown. What went down.

## What went down?
You tell me, man.

## \"No,\" what?
...I'm dying out there.

## I didn't need to know that a man I'm defending on a gang-murder rap is a prison soldier who kills over drugs?
It was self-defense.

## -- How could I help you?
By trusting me. Shit, man...

## Are you willing to testify that the man you saw shoot Jimmy Chin was not the man the cops arrested?
They g-got the wrong g-guy.

## ...You told the Desk Sergeant you were certain Mr. Kim wasn't the killer? You left your telephone number?
Y-yes, sir.

## Did the police make any attempt to phone you, to follow up?
No, s-sir.

## Of course you know Dean Rabin, one of my Assistant D.A.s. Dean generally handles nuisance cases like the... what's the man's name?
Shu Kai Kim.

## Are you implying that my motives are less than sincere?
What am I looking for? You're the one talking deal.

## You're my only problem, Ed. What does it take to make you go away?
I see, He'd walk out next month.

## We reconvict, your man's looking at 25 years on two counts, served consecutively. So what I'd like to ask, Ed, is, Are you joking?
I never joke about waiving a client's Sixth Amendment right to trial.

## Isn't it unusual for a man who's just committed a murder in plain sight to bring the weapon back to his apartment?
Calls for speculation.

## You don't speak any Chinese dialects? Then you get your intelligence from snitches?
Badgering.

## To the best of your recollection, were you sober when you performed the tests?
Objection.

## -- Can't Mr. Dowd find his own expert witness, your Honor?
I'd need a continuance. Three weeks at least.

## Did you do any hands-on work or did you just supervise, from on high?
Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.

## And who were the detectives who assisted you, Mr. Reynard?
Lou Sklaroff, Vin Badalato, Dave Montell.

## And who was Arturo Esparza?
I don't think I know that name.

## I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
You're trespassing into the area of witness protection, Mr. Dowd. Such showboating puts lives at risk.

## Isn't it true that without Esparza, you had no investigation?
I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd.

## -- Eddie told you?
My skip-trace turned up two Cecil Stipes. One's in Butte, Montana. Other's at Riverhead Veterans Psychiatric.

## You getting this?
-- Every word.

## Shouldn't one of us...?
No -- leave him be. It's better for everyone.

## What do you want?
I'm Roger Baron. I work with Edward Dowd.

## -- What trial?
I followed you here from court.

## ...And you were at the trial to... to see that justice was done?
That's right.

## -- Why don't you ask Chuckie?
I would tend to plead the Fifth.

## Mr. Ortega... What is \"La Compania\"?
A Cubano army, basically... inside and outside prisons.

## And its purpose?
Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.

## For control of the prison drug trade?
I would tend to plead the Fifth.

## Do the rival gangs compete for control of the prison drug trade?
Yeah, we do some of that.

## What is your rank within La Compania?
\"Name, rank and serial,\" Mr. Ortega. Let's not hide behind the Fifth.

## And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do?
A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...

## \"Materiel\"? What do you mean by that?
Cigarettes, candy bars... PCP, crack...

## If a member of the Aryan Brothers tries to cut in on your distribution?
...A soldado, he takes care of it.

## Mr. Ortega, what is Shu Kai Kim's rank within La Compania?
Soldado.

## Isn't it unusual for an Asian to be accepted into a Cuban prison gang?
Shu's the only one I know of...

## And why was an exception made?
Chinatown. Sounded pretty cold...

## You mean to say Mr. Kim told you that he murdered Jimmy Chin?
You're a l-lawyer? I... I haven't had my meds, or m-my vital signs t-taken yet. I...

## Mr. Stipe. A young man named Jimmy Chin was shot to death eight years ago, in Chinatown. Do you remember talking to the police?
That guy they arrested -- he was the wrong g-guy.

## And you b-believe that.
CIA?

## Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper?
Albert.

## Let's test it for the record. Will the next victim be a man or a woman?
A woman.

## What color hair will she have?
Blonde.

## You're describing half the high school girls in America. What is she doing right now?
She is preparing a great abundance of food.

## SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO DONNA?
NO! GOD, NO...

## Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
I am the One who wants to breathe thru your nose and taste thru your mouth.

## Where were you for the last hour? I've been lookin' for you?
I was right behind you, but you're too dumb to turn around. If he turned around he might get dizzy and fall down.

## I'M NOT KIDDIN'. WHERE WERE YOU? WHO WERE YOU WITH?
Get lost Bobby.

## Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11,00.

## This isn't Mike. Is this Mike?
Bobby... ssshhhh... you killed Mike.

## What was?
The stuff we got last night.

## What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?
Don't get funny with me again.

## Why? Why not? Where are you goin'?
We can do it right here.

## That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?
Out back in our morgue.

## Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.

## Sam, get the body and put it in the van. Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
My alibi is as strong as these bands of steel.

## Well, where are you going?
I am going over here.

## Can you tell me who's trailer it was... and who stayed in the trailer?
An old woman and her grandson.

## Can you tell me what their names were?
Chalfont. Weird. Chalfont was the name of the folks that rented the space before they did. Two Chalfonts.

## Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?
Yep, it sure is.

## Did she have someone with her?
Right. She had a friend with her. The friend took off.

## Yes they do. Did she have visitors?
No, hey, I already told this whole damn thing to Sheriff \"Not-Quite- Able\"... Here's the trailer now.

## Is there a golf course around here?
Not a lot around here, no. Got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls.

## Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' witnesses.

## Did you know Teresa Banks?
No you couldn't.

## Smell something fishy, huh?
Congratulations. I heard about that.

## What is it, Gordon?
COOP, AGENT CHET DESMOND HAS DISAPPEARED. GONE LIKE THE WIND IN DEER MEADOW.

## Phillip?
COOPER, MEET THE LONG LOST PHILLIP JEFFRIES. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM AT THE ACADEMY.

## What?
ALBERT, COME BACK HERE. HE'S GONE CALL THE FRONT DESK.

## QUICKLY MEN... WORD ASSOCIATION, COOP. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW?
Teresa Banks.

## ALBERT?
It was a year ago today that Teresa Banks was killed. I'm wondering if the murderer will ever kill again.

## Did Gordon show you a woman named Lil?
I'm up to speed, Stanley.

## And no one found the ring?
No, sir, we did not.

## Where is the ring?
ANOTHER PLACE Someone else has it now.

## Where am I? And how can I leave?
ANOTHER PLACE You are here and there is no place to go...

## Where's Hap?
He's dead -- good and dead.

## Any friends?
No.

## Ever see her with someone else?
No.

## Did she ever mention any friends?
No. Ask Irene over there.

## How come Jack let's you work here?
Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.

## Came looking for a job with a friend of hers. Pretty girl. Could've been her sister.
She only worked here a month. Nice girl. Never seemed to get here on time though. Ask me she had a little problem with --

## What happened to her?
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.

## Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
No.

## Do you take cocaine, Irene?
No, I do not. I never took cocaine or any other drugs. I don't take drugs.

## He's with me. Anything you would like to tell us about Teresa Banks that would help us out?
I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a \"freak accident\".

## What do you mean?
Thanks.

## That was really something. That dancing girl. What did it mean?
Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.

## Shorthand. Really?
We're heading into a difficult situation.

## I'll explain it to you. Do you remember Lil's dance?
Lil was wearing a sour face.

## What do you mean?
Oh, the uncle is missing.

## Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
A blue rose.

## What did Gordon's tie mean?
What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.

## Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
He talks loud. And he loves his code.

## Yes, it is good. What do you think is in these other drawers?
I don't know, Sam.

## Accidental?
Agent Desmond, would you hold the finger for me. There's something up there.

## What is it?
It is a piece of paper with the letter \"T\" imprinted on it. Take a look.

## Geez, Agent Desmond, it's three-thirty in the morning. Where are we going to sleep?
We're not. You and I are going to get some food.

## Yes, it's been several hours since we've eaten. I didn't realize that so much time had past, did you, Agent Desmond?
Agent Desmond, it's...

## Are you speaking to me in a code?
No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.

## I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond?
He's not the murderer. But he's a bozo.

## When he says, \"Discussion\", how do you take that, Agent Desmond?
I don't take it, Sam. I give it.

## We do notice things, don't we, Agent Desmond? Are you going back to the trailer park for the Blue rose?
If I am going to get through math today, you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick.

## You didn't do your homework?
Noooo...

## When?
The usual, 9,15.

## Are you going to tell him about that \"someone else\"?
I don't know what to do.

## Are you going to see James tonight?
Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.

## You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
Maybe.

## Well, why not?
Because Bobby is a loser, you said so yourself. He's a goon. James is the one. He loves you with that \"lasting love\"... \"true love\".

## Yes, James is very sweet. Why don't you get out your violin, Donna?
Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.

## Do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster?
Faster and faster. For a long time you wouldn't feel anything. Then you would burst into fire... forever.

## Sure. What do you want me to call you?
Call me anything just don't call me late for dinner.

## Donna, are you my best friend?
Of course...

## What is it Laura? What's wrong?
I just want a friend. Just one friend for just one minute...

## Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
Yes, that's what I want. Thanks D.

## Do you want to talk?
No, I want to smoke.

## I'm in a mess today, too. I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think?
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.

## This is about sex, not like. Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins. You want a muffin?
If I can smoke it.

## You want a muffin?
Donna, you are a muffin.

## Where are you going?
No place, fast. And you're not coming.

## You mean Fred and Ginger?
Dancing.

## What are you doing?
Nothing.

## Not you, Donna, not you.
Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?

## I can't remember anything about last night. Is there something I should remember?
No, you should forget about last night.

## You're not mad at me?
No.

## How did the car get back here?
WE got it back, that's all.

## How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
I can't help you there.

## Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
All my things have me in them. I don't want you to be like me.

## Why do you do it, Laura?
Cause I like it.

## What'll it be?
Fill 'er up.

## Who would do that?
Bob.

## What does Bob say?
He wants to be me... or he will kill me.

## Did you make me a tape?
I already made you two tapes.

## What? She asked about my father?
Right on time, baby.

## Laura, do you love me?
Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter.

## You're on somethin' again, aren't you?
James...

## When am I going to see you?
I've got to see you.

## This afternoon?
Okay. Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.

## What about tonight?
I can't tonight.

## What's going on?
I just can't, James. I can't do it.

## What do you mean?
You know it and I know it.

## What?
When he finds out.

## What?
Bobby killed a guy.

## See what?
Right. Open your eyes, James. You don't know me. Even Donna doesn't know me. Your Laura disappeared... It's just me now.

## Boating?
No.

## Hiking?
No.

## Eating?
You'd think so.

## Sex?
You're getting warmer.

## Trees?
Exactment. They are nuts about wood. They get goofy over trees.

## What are you afraid of? What people think?
I don't want to offend the customs of your country.

## Fish eyes?
Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.

## Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
I understand.

## Sure honey, what's the hurry?
I forgot my books at school.

## What?
You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.

## What were you doing in my room?
I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand.

## Mom... what are you wearing?
My god, I am going to have another breakdown. God, god.

## Where's Dad?
Ben asked him to stay late to plan for the Norwegians.

## Hi, honey, how's Donna?
Fine.

## School?
...school's fine...

## Sit down... sit down... Are you hungry?
Not really.

## Who was that?
A friend from school.

## No, you haven't met him. Have you met him?
No.

## Are you sure you're okay?
Yes.

## Dad?
Yes.

## Did you come home during the day last week?
No.

## Laura. What's wrong this morning?
Stay away from me.

## Leland, what are you doing?
Look at this finger here.

## Did you get this from your lover?
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.

## Did Bobby give you that or is there someone new?
Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.

## How do you know what she doesn't like?
Oh, Leland, sit down and eat you dinner.

## Soon. How about next time we party with the girlfriends you told me about?
I can arrange that. I like that.

## Who am I?
I don't know.

## What's wrong?
Nothing, I chickened out.

## Shelly, would you give Laura a quick hand with the \"Meals on Wheels\"?
I'm kind of busy, Norma.

## Laura just took off. She asked me to do the run today. Should I do it?
What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.

## Norma, are you alright?
Come back as soon as you can.

## Abrams. Yes. How are you today?
I'm fine.

## Good. You ever been inside a hospital?
Yes.

## Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.

## What did he find?
Nothing.

## How good's your intelligence?
Very good.

## And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
As far as we know, nothing.

## If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
Well, of course, it's always dangerous...

## I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
Yes.

## How did you settle on the amount?
We thought it was just.

## What are you doing here?
It looks that way.

## To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
...a Mrs. Doneghy called... I told you that.

## What does it mean?
They want to settle. It means a lot of money.

## You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
It's a crime.

## You would not...?
No.

## In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right?
Yes.

## ...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
Yes.

## They lied.' Indeed! When did they lie? And do you know what a lie is?
I do. Yes.

## You didn't write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
Because I kept a copy. I have it right here.

## Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye. Is that correct?
That is correct. I was engaged to render an opinion.

## Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today?
Just as you are, Sir...

## Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...

## ...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine?
No.

## Neurology?
No.

## Orthopedics?
I'm just an M.D.

## Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
I know of him.

## How is that?
Through, through his book.

## What book is that?
Meth... Methodology and Technique...

## ...of Anesthesiology?
Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.

## How old are you?
I am seventy-four years old.

## Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of medicine?
I'm on the staff of...

## ...to get her heartbeat back...?
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...

## Mr. Concannon...?
Nothing further, your Honor.

## Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
Objection! This is ri... expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...

## You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby. Were you not?
Yes.

## Anything special about the case?
When she...

## Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr. Marx, of course...

## What did these people do when her heart stopped?
We went to Code Blue...

## Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
Well, many reasons, actually...

## Tell me one?
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...

## ...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear. Isn't that what you did?
My God, we tried to save her... You can't know... You can't know...

## You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up. Who do you think you are? Who do you think you are...?
Hold on a second.

## I'm going to have you disbarred. I'm going to have your ticket. You know what you did? Do you know what you did?
It's all right, Mickey.

## Dr. Thompson...?
It was good of you to meet...

## Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
It's my opinion it took him much longer. Nine... ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.

## I'm afraid that's not true. Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home.

## Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
I... given the limits of your question, that's correct.

## Why is that?
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she...

## Is that what a good doctor would do? How old are you, please?
I am seventy-four years old.

## What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
I am on the staff of...

## She getting good care over there?
Actually, yes. It's by no means bad, I...

## Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.' General textbook on the subject. Is that correct?
I. Yes. It is.

## That's perfectly all right. I'm kind of rushed. Do you mind if we walk while we talk?
I read the hospital report on your client.

## Right. Who called?
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...

## ...and you're going to do that?
Yes.

## You're going to settle out of court?
Yes.

## Why?
Her doctors killed her.

## I'm sorry...?
Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life. Her doctors murdered her.

## Do you know who her doctors were?
I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.

## Hi. How are you doing?
I've been meaning to come in a long time.

## You live in the neighborhood?
Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.

## How old is he?
Four. You're great with these kids.

## Who told you that?
Mrs...

## That's a wonderful profession. My daughter-in-law's a nurse. What did you do, stop?
Kathy Price...

## These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
Kathy Costello. That's my maiden name.

## D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
Yes.

## What did she say?
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.

## And did you write the numeral 'one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
I did.

## Why is that?
I was held up.

## What is it?
Thank you for seeing me.

## Is the Plaintiff ready?
Ready, your Honor.

## Defense...?
Do we have time this morning to... All right. Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.

## Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue. Dr. Thompson. Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
Sustained. Yes. The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.

## Yes, Mr. Galvin?
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...

## Are you done?
Nothing further, your Honor...

## Mr. Concannon...?
I object, your Honor...

## D'you find an apartment?
Still looking.

## I changed my life today. What did you do?
I changed my room at the Hotel.

## Why?
The TV didn't work.

## And what are you? A cop?
I'm a lawyer.

## Who says I'm the one that called it off?
Laura.

## What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
You just got lucky. D'you eat yet? Come on.

## The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth? You want another drink?
I think I will.

## Maybe what?
Maybe I can do something right.

## And is that what you're going to do? Is that what you're going to do...?
That's what I'm going to try to do.

## What...?
Is this a bad time.

## What happened...?
They, uh, they got to my witness.

## ...and is that serious?
I've got to work...

## Do you want me to go...?
No, no, I'm just...

## Why don't you get some rest?
I've got to work.

## You're going to stay here...?
Yes.

## Do you think it's my fault?
Isn't there something you...

## And it's over...?
Yes.

## You do what you want. You want to leave... You want to go kill yourself?
I...

## Who told you that?
You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.

## And what makes you so tough?
Maybe I'll tell you later.

## Is there going to be a later...?
Not if you don't grow up...

## What is that to you...?
What would you like it to be to me...? I, I, I can't invest in failure.

## Is it over?
No.

## What are you going to do?
I don't have a goddamned idea.

## I have to reach him. This is an emergency. Could you give me his home number?
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...

## This is Miss Costello...?
Yes. Price...

## Pardon?
Kathy Price.

## ...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no question of that. It's just a matter of how big...

## Then why aren't you testifying for their side?
I can subpoena you, you know. I can get you up there on the stand.

## And ask me what?
Who put my client in the hospital for life.

## I do. Who is it? The Doctors. What do you owe them?
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.

## Then why don't you testify?
You know, you're pushy, fella...

## I'm... Mrs. Doneghy? I'm Frank Galvin... why didn't you go in?
It's locked.

## It's locked?
It's not a good case. It's a very good case.

## ...You saw her?
Yes. Yes, I have.

## ...fifty thousand dollars?
I don't want to leave her. Dick... the, the... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will...

## Where is he?
I... please. My wife... my wife's prescription has run out. If I can call him...

## Another, Frank...?
I want to buy you a drink.

## Well, well, well. Huh?
Yeah.

## What the hell do you think you're doing...? What's going on here...?
Uh...

## ...now who is that...?
...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them...

## Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
One lousy letter eighteen months ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case your way...

## What do you want?
Come on. Let's get a drink.

## Are you out of your mind...?
...I'm going to need your help...

## You -- Listen, you said to me, 'if not now, when...'
...I have to stand up for her...

## Who have we got?
We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.

## Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
I'm going to get laid.

## I'm getting it back. Don't worry about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find the obstetric nurse?
Mary Rooney. She won't talk to me. I tried her at the hospital. I'm going to try her back at home. Read this.

## John, gimme a cuesta-ray.
So what?

## I've got to go see Gruber. What's the best cigars you have?
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.

## What happened, Joey...?
I can't talk now.

## D'you find the obstetric nurse?
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital. She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...

## How are you holding up?
I'm swell.

## Okay. What do you do when you don't have a witness?
You use their witness.

## Are you with me... are you awake...?
Yeah. I'm awake.

## Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
Who? They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.

## All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?
What difference can that make...? All right...

## The 'History'...?
How old are you, how many children... when did you last eat...

## We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
The broad has disappeared...

## The Hospital...?
...yeah... good...

## What the hell are you doing here?
We got to talk.

## What are you doing in New York...?
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...

## We got a mistrial, you know. Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
I don't want a mistrial.

## She did?
I just saw her.

## You saw Kat in New York... ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?
Dr. Towler...

## What happened in those three minutes...?
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...

## Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
Yes.

## Huh. And why is that?
Because she was anemic. It's right there on her chart. Her brain was getting less oxygen anyway...

## Should I?
Yes.

## The Big Boy did...?
Huh.

## Looks almost cold now, don't it?
That won't start no more fires. We might's well go home.

## The same thing that happened on our Pacific Coast. Anything from them yet?
STAFF Mister Secretary - if they link up with those others near Fresno...

## Is that it over there?
Yes...ugly looking, isn't it.

## Did you see it come down?
Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.

## Well, I did a thesis on modern scien- tists - working for my Masters degree.
What's that fellow over there trying to do - dig it out?

## Why, sure -- I got it! Do you have a match?
I'm sorry. I don't smoke.

## What's he like?
Like...ah...

## How does it happen cars are running?
Automobile ignitions are insulated.

## Would you like some coffee, General?
We can't go into town - everybody's getting out of there! I'll fly you over to Pasadena.

## I bought it for the square dance. I thought I ought to wear some- thing Western.
Can you handle one of these?

## Is that... machine...?
It's gone now.

## I almost forget when I ate last. It looks so good.... You know, mostly I get my meals in coffee shops and restaurants.
Where are we?

## Don't you live at home?
No, on the campus. I haven't any family.

## I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
How long was I out?

## My kid brother has one. You know why?
Yes ... Fits better in a football helmet.

## I wonder if they're going through this too...?
I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...

## If we get what transportation we can, and pick up instruments and books from Pacific-Tech...
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?

## Gratzman! -- Gratzman! Did you get those biotics?
No. I thought you had them.

## I got a message for you. You're the guys from Pacific-Tech, ain't you?
Right.

## Couldn't you try to communicate with them first - and shoot later if you have to?
My orders are not to go into action unless they make a move out of there.

## That probably dropped half way to Pomona!...What do you think?
It was nearer than that.

## Everything human don't have to look like you and me....
Better'n a lion farm or a snake pit. We won't have to feed it!

## I thought you'd killed Freddy off.
What'll we say to 'em?

## Which means he's having nightmares again?
He's very excited about it.

## Can I read it?
You mean that was a...

## So?
So I don't know about horror.

## I know. We asked him to keep it kind of surprise until we talked. Look, how about we get in touch your agent. You still with Jerry?
Yes, but...

## And since you've been thinking of making it. Has anything funny happened?
I don't follow.

## Like weird calls, by any chance?
Chase...

## You get any sleep last night?
More or less. Dylan, time to get dressed. I'm late.

## Anything other than the obvious bothering you?
Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.

## Hasn't been another call, has there?
Maybe. Or maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.

## What if it isn't over?
Maybe you should tell me your dream.

## I should survive two days in Palmdale supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial, don't you think?
Guess so.

## Heather?
Chase. Hi...

## What's up?
Chase, you'd better come home.

## What? What kind of episode?
He was just acting very strange. He thinks somebody's after him, Chase. It's scary, it scared me. He was acting like...

## Like what?
Like Freddy.

## Forget those two clowns, Heather. Answer me, did you get another call from that guy or not?
Yes.

## Any history of epilepsy in your family?
No.

## Diabetes?
No.

## Was there any trigger event? A trauma, shock or... You haven't shown him any of the films you make, have you? The horror stuff?
No...

## Does he have to stay here over night?
Absolutely.

## Sometimes what a child says or fantasizes will give a clue to what ails him. Did he say anything while he was still lucid?
Ms. Langenkamp. I'm afraid there are no evening visiting hours in Intensive Care.

## Is he all right?
Dylan? He's holding well. Earlier he had some problems, he's in an oxygen tent just now...

## If these had been a few inches nearer to the wrist... What did you say you cut yourself on?
It was an earthquake and it was dark. I have no idea.

## What?
He sleepwalks, you idiot! He's fully capable of walking out of this hospital. Oh my God...He thinks I've gone home...

## You going away?
Just for a few hours. Julie'll be with you.

## Dylan, I gotta go. Forgive me?
Bye.

## Rex? Who's Rex?
Finish, please!

## Who?
The mean old man with the claws.

## He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
Right.

## Mommy's fine, Dylan. Just had a bad dream. What're you doing out of bed?
Rex woke me up. He was fighting.

## Your bed?
Under my covers. Kids singing, and way down there, the man...the mean man...

## And...what's the man doing?
Trying to get up...trying to get into our world.

## Do you have to die to see God?
No, I don't think so. You just have to...pray, or reach...

## Why does God let there be bad things?
I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.

## Can you come with me in my dreams?
Home.

## You okay, champ?
Can we go get Rex, now? The bad man's getting awful close.

## Tell you what. I'm gonna go get Rex for you right now. You know home isn't far from here, right?
Right 'cross the freeway.

## You saw him, didn't you, Dylan!?
Coming for you...

## Dylan, where's the man?
Here.

## A story?
Yes. It's a story. A story for a movie.

## You okay?
I'm fine.

## Everything went great, I thought. We really got you, didn't we?
I don't know why you didn't tell me, that's all.

## In what, a romantic comedy?
Just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two.

## Heather? You doing okay?
Holding my own. You know that guy who was calling me all the time? He's started again. He's been putting stuff in my mail.

## Yeah...how'd you know?
Call it a guess...

## Anyway, what I was calling about was...have you seen any of the script, by any chance?
Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least. I asked him at the funeral.

## What...happened?
Quake knocked you off your feet. You got bumped pretty good, actually.

## Kids know when something's bugging a parent. You've got no idea who this is calling?
Freddy, for all I know.

## Holy...
You really think Dylan's okay?

## Where's Dylan?! Have you seen him?
I know how Chase really died.

## What are you talking about?
Fred Krueger did it.

## 1 Is Chase Porter your husband?
Yes.

## The car's no there yet?
No. I...listen, I can't make it in today.

## You're kidding, right?
I'm sorry, I can't.

## Heather, what is it?
Dunno. Just have this feeling today...

## I'll call the cops for you. You've got the number on the fridge, right?
Thanks. Just give them the time he called. They're keeping a list, supposedly. Sorry. My nerves are so raw these days.

## No, Rex is not going to die. Julie, you know where the sewing stuff is, don't you?
Sure. We'll do an operation, Doctor Dylan and Doctor Julie. We'll fix him good as new.

## No, I don't think that at all. How is he?
They wouldn't let me...

## What's that?
Killing innocence, one way or the other.

## This is still a script we're talking about, right?
I think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress.

## Then, in this nightmare in progress, does this thing have any weaknesses?
It can be captured, sometimes.

## Captured? How?
Like the Genie in the bottle.

## If Freddy's loose, I mean, in your script, where's he going to go? Another age? Another form?
That's not what the dreams say he's doing.

## Me? Why me?
Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense. You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.

## Dylan. And... Chase. My God, Wes, did you know?
Heather, it's just a movie, a dream, really...

## Choice? What kind of choice?
Whether or not you're willing to play Nancy one last time.

## Now that you have a child, is it possible you've decided horror is bad for children?
No, not really. I...

## Do you let your child watch your movies?
My child? No...but...

## And how about your co-star in NIGHTMARE I. Would you trust him alone with your child?
Robert? I...

## Oh, hi. I'm fine, Sara. My God, a voice from the past!
Yes?

## Uh...sure...when?
No time like the present. The car will bring you.

## Now?
Just take a minute. You'll be glad you did, I bet.

## Can I get you something to drink?
Coffee'd be nice.

## Sounds good. Kim, would you get Heather and me a coffee? How you like it, Hon?
Black's fine.

## Did we lose anybody?
Not yet.

## Your father?
All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.

## What?
He never would have believed a woman like you existed.

## Do you remember the last time you and I danced under the stars?
Guilty.

## Why did we begin this?
We were idealists.

## What are they doing?
Yes, Sir.

## Why wasn't I made aware of this Bill?
I didn't know sir.

## Why didn't you drop any sail?
Skipper called us out of the rigging.

## But your instinct was to lose sail?
My instinct was to not get electrocuted.

## How old are you, son?
Fifteen.

## Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
You came back, Tod. You came back.

## What do you mean?
It's me, don't you see. Terry's right, I'm the escape hatch. I disobeyed order.

## Where's Mom?
I couldn't bring her down here until I knew you were safe.

## I thought we'd find a store, get you fixed up and then get you some lunch. That sound good?
Yeah, sure.

## Why don't you go and try some of that on?
Okay.

## Albatross?
Yeah.

## Rick March. Who the hell are you?
Gieg, Chuck.

## What the \"Bowsprit Affair\"?
Well, Romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the bowsprit.

## What do you mean?
I mean she looks pretty damn good in her all-together for being thirty.

## Where you going?
To take a piss.

## Yeah, that's right. You wanna come in and shake it for me?
If you're gonna cheat, you might as well copy off somebody who's gonna get the answer right.

## Believe what?
Her name. Bregitta. It's poetry.

## You okay?
Yeah. How'd you do.

## Yes you could. You did. This is all you. Nobody else.
What about you?

## What?
That we're going back. I don't want it to end. I don't want to be what I was when I left.

## What was that?
Anonymous.

## Figured what out?
Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.

## You gonna jump? Or are you just having a last look?
I was just thinking that I never had a new pair of shoes till I was twelve.

## Hey, shut up will ya?
It was a bad dream...

## You only hurt yourself you know?
Like you really care. Like any of you give a shit what happens to me.

## Can we talk?
I guess.

## Is it true Phil?
I gotta go.

## Honey, did you know that the Albatross was captured by the Germans during World War II?
No, I didn't.

## Do you have your ticket?
Yes.

## Passport?
Look, I just better go.

## What the hell is going on?
Maybe it's an air raid.

## How ya doing?
Fine.

## I'm used to spending a lot of time alone. I guess that's what I thought it would be out here. But, it's not is it?
I'm sorry I left you hanging up there.

## Do what?
Ya know... \"It\".

## What'd you do?
I said \"Sorry, wrong room\" and walked away.

## Depths of hell... Ohio. How 'bout you?
Kennet Square, PA. 'Mushroom capital of the world'.

## Who told you that?
My dad.

## It works?
Swear to God. Only good advice he ever gave me. Now, go back to sleep.

## Jesus, you never told them?
I couldn't.

## I can't make it out?
I can't go in there.

## You all right?
It was my fault. I slipped.

## Face what?
Uh, huh.

## Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
Sometimes it gets exciting out here.

## Shouldn't we turn away?
You can't run from the wind son. You trim your sails, face the music and let the chips fall. Bill, let's close her up, dog, tight.

## What's on your mind?
I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.

## Sir...?
Close the door. Sit down.

## Why do you think I'm sending him home?
He killed the dolphin.

## Of what?
Of a fight he can't win out here.

## I mean he has all these expectations and he doesn't even know who his own kid is. What right did then have to show up here?
They have every right Chuck.

## Does Phil know how you guys feel?
I don't know.

## Stow away?
He left his passport in Curacao. It's being mailed to Panama.

## Why didn't you turn hard to port as the wind hit?
I thought we'd have a better chance if I headed into the wind so we could spill air from our sails.

## Is that what you were trained to do?
No.

## So when the captain gave you an order contrary to your training, you thought he was making a mistake?
No.

## What is it we can do for you today?
Well, we've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony.

## What's wrong, you don't like steak?
I should be eating with the crew.

## I can take care of myself.
Why are you here?

## Oh, really?
It has nothing to do with him.

## It's okay. I'll be in, in a minute. Look, what do you want?
I think you were too hard on Weathers.

## You do?
Yes. I do.

## What's that?
A padlock.

## What's that?
They'll know about it in the morning.

## How the hell are we gonna get outta here?
We'll think of something.

## Why would you do that?
I couldn't do it.

## How would you know?
Trust me donut. I know.

## They tell you that?
I figured it out.

## Why, man?
I don't have to listen to this.

## You will if you wanna eat. Right George?
That's not a satisfactory answer.

## You know what he is talking about here?
This isn't just a story!! It's history made allegory. It is a philosophical handbook for life! It holds the secret of this very voyage.

## What?
If it were only that simple, my young friend. Read on, gentlemen. Read on.

## What do you think?
Barometer's dropping. The first blow'll come from the south. Might get interesting.

## What's that?
Terry left his passport in Curacao. We could hide him...

## What?
Fuck off man. It's just a fish.

## About yourself?
About anything.

## How long you been standing there?
Long enough.

## You've gotta be kidding?
But, they don't speak English.

## The first thing is I don't like people talking when I'm talking so the two of you, shut up.
Phil. What are you doing?

## Do you have something to say?
No.

## What?
Up you go. Right now.

## What's it going to be?
I'm sorry...

## What are you blubbering about?
I don't know...

## What makes you so sure it was one?
I can't be sure.

## How'd you manage to piss off a guy as powerful as Francis Boutillier?
It wasn't hard.

## And you didn't do anything about it?
No. I didn't.

## If this young man had responded instantly to your command, do you believe the ship might have been spared?
I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.

## Then what are you trying to say then?
Soon as we ship it'll be \"forgetta\".

## Yes, ma'am. What's on your almost- perfect mind this evening?
How ya feelin', Artie? I heard you wasn't doin' too well recent.

## So you're gonna be needin' the \"blue- bird\" pretty soon?
Real soon... I'll be makin' the swap tomorrow, and thanks again, Beany.

## Y'all take American Express?
Yessir.

## How old are you?
Twenty.

## Hey, pretty woman... Sailor here?
No, he's out changin' the oil in the car.

## Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there?
Well... Yeah - okay.

## Hey... You gotta smell in this room of puke... You been pukin' in here, little girl? Huh?... You sick?... Pregnant?
You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.

## Need a hand?
Thanks, Bobby, 'bout done.

## How 'bout a beer?
That'd be fine, Bobby.

## Let's go by Rosarita's. You been there yet?
No, haven't heard of it.

## This your car?
Restin' in our room. She ain't been feelin' well.

## You black?
No.

## You an indian?
No.

## They look like a bunch of good ol' boys to me. I guess it's oil money, huh?
Oil, gas, cattle, farmin'. Ain't nobody shows off around here. Iguana County's one of the richest in Texas.

## Why not?
I been studyin' a situation over in Lobo, take two men to handle it.

## Feed store keeps up to five K in their safe. Need me a good boy for back-up. Even split. You interested?
No... I don't think so, man.

## Whattaya mean family?
Well... I mean like Lula bein' in a family way.

## When did you talk to Lula?
Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out.

## Just took a guess is all... You in or out on this deal?
I ain't fuckin' sure, Bobby.

## Don't think about it too long. You had enough?
Have now.

## Why should it?
That's right... Take one of these.

## What is it?
Nice of you to drop by.

## You still screwing sixteen-year-olds in the ass?
Ain't never had no girl pull a blade on me.

## You heard from Reggie?
Juana called. They're stayin' another week.

## No shit?!?! You know him?
Used to.

## What'd you say?
No, of course.

## Gas?
Mostly black though in that boogie place.

## What's the name of it?
Club Zanzibar.

## You say it's straight ahead a mile?
About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.

## What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
Set one up.

## So who you out sleuthin' for now?... Can I help ya?
Actually, I'm lookin' for Marietta's daughter, Lula. Her and 'er beau took off the other day. Marietta's real upset about it.

## You hitched yet?
No sir...

## Whattaya do there?
I thought you two were in Austin, Texas. Or Takes-us, as they say in these parts.

## But how are you finding New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
Call me Johnnie... N.O. has always been a good town to sit around in.

## Do you know Honduras, Johnny?
Oh, many things...

## What happened on the charges?
The Good Witch...

## You are from New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
Johnnie, please. Nope. Charlotte, North Carolina. Here on business.

## In what capacity?
In many capacities.

## Why not? How was the fishin'?
I think they are too serious, these American fishermen. In Honduras, we are not so concerned with the method.

## How's that?
Gotta admit, you guys are - two in four dozen.

## Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.

## What?
I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.

## What is it, Johnnie?
Just some guys I met here... I keep seein' 'em... Now tell me...

## Honey, I have to ask you this... Is Santos involved in any of this?
Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.

## This 'bout the fifth time?
I'll pack my things and meet you downstairs.

## How'll he know what we look like? He seen our photo?
Damn it, child! Now look what you made me do.

## What I made you do, mama?
Nothin', honey. Mama's just actin' strange.

## Why, Pace Roscoe Ripley, ain't you got one cute mouth tonight?
I still ain't sure what my daddy looks like.

## Course he ain't never killed nobody. Why'd you say that, Pace?
Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin'.

## And?
Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.

## Why we sittin' here, mama?
Thinkin' a second, baby.

## Why, honey?
Case daddy don't like me. What if he don't like that I don't got his color hair.

## Stab it and steer.
Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at \"The Hurricane.\"

## What brand'd she smoke?
Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.

## Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth white neck. It was like on a statue it was so white?
But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.

## You're terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know?
I can't hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth.

## So how'd he finally nail you? Right there in the kitchen?
No, he picked me up.

## And you never told nobody about it?
Here she goes again...

## You okay, honey?
That woman's laugh creeps me out. I heard somethin' like that... somewhere before... Sound'd like the wicked witch...

## I'm always ready to dance. But I need me a kiss first, honey. Just one?
Hell, you just rubbed up against the wrong girl is all.

## That's good... Now go get yourself a beer. You fellas have alotta the same power Elvis had... Y'all know this one?
What you want to watch this trash for? Ain't one of those people have a real thought in their brain.

## That so? You want to tell me what, if any, real thoughts you had lately?
What you have to get personal about so quick? All I mean is you could possibly read a book.

## We didn't have no TV up at Pee Dee, baby, you know?
I'm sorry, sweetie. I forget some moments where all you been the last two years.

## Don't the reject guys get anythin'?
Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.

## You think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes, peanut. Ain't we been doin' a pretty fair job this far?
Oh, you know exactly what I mean, honey? It'd make the future so simple and nice.

## Musta been a lesson tellin' ya it was the wrong time... What did you do, your mama find out?
She got me an abortion...

## You tell the boy who knocked you up?
It was my cousin, Dell, done it? His folks used to visit with us summers.

## Actin' funny how?
Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell's mama? She found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.

## One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell puttin' one big cockroach on his anus?
Hell, peanut...

## What's that?
When he was about seventeen, he startin' losin' his hair.

## So?
I'd got to the far end of the world for you, baby... You know I would.

## Sorry, baby... When's the first time you done it with a girl who wasn't hookin'?
She looked right at me and run her tongue over her lips and put her hand on my arm - told me her name was Irma.

## What'd you say to her?
I guess.

## Poor baby. She don't know what she missed. What color hair she have?
I'll drop mama a postcard from somewhere. I mean, I don't want her to worry no more'n necessary.

## It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?
They sure do stink.

## Thank the Lord. Well, you ain't let me down yet, Sailor. That's more'n I can say for the rest of the world?
Life is a bitch and then you marry one.

## What kinda trash talk is that?
What it says on the bumper sticker up front. On that pickup.

## That's disgustin'. Those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?
Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.

## Got anyplace special in mind?
How about that one? The Host of the Old South Hotel.

## What's that, honey?
There ain't no water in the swimmin' pool. Just a dead tree fell in, prob'ly from bein' struck by lightnin'.

## Sailor? You expect me to believe a man'd be goin' around with a arm sewed to his nose?
Sailor Ripley! You stop! You're makin' this shit up and I ain't gonna sit for it!

## We sure don't, honey... Get me a Mounds?
You really are dangerously cute, honey. I gotta admit it.

## What lesson do get outta that story, Lula?
It's just another case, Sailor.

## What's that, peanut?
One person thinks he's doin' somethin' good and ever'body else gets upset about it.

## My God, it better be, darlin', cause it'd be the last... What time is it?
Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts...

## You certain?
I ain't never met anyone come close to you, sugar.

## What was this one?
It wasn't no fun, Lula. The wind was blowin' super-hard and I wasn't dressed warm. Only instead of freezin', I was sweatin' strong.

## Who do?
Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.

## He was sittin' there havin' a beignet at the Cafe Du Monde. Do you think he saw us?
Lula, darlin'... Makes no difference anyway... We're outta here.

## Just part of life on the road, peanut.
You don't feel you was a little hard on the guy, honey?

## I wouldn't mind a little night life. How about you?
Hard to tell what's shakin' in a place like this, honey. You don't want to be walkin' in the wrong door.

## You ready for this?
We'll find out in a hurry.

## I'll be damned if I'm leavin'. That band is too good?
Uh huh.

## You notice that woman when we come in? The white woman sittin' by herself?
Yeah.

## Well, she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?
Honey, we bein' strangers here and all, this is the kinda place we don't want to make nothin' of nothin'.

## What's wrong, sweetheart? Somethin' botherin' you?
Mama. I been thinkin' about her. She's prob'ly worried to death by now.

## Pardon me? Y'all got a phone here I can use?
I was just wastin' time, peanut, till you come back.

## How much we got left, honey?
Under a hundred.

## You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?
Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.

## This ain't news, sweetheart. I hate to tell ya.
What's that, peanut?

## You knew my daddy?
Yes I did... I sure did... The bad side of it is I did some drivin' for a man named Marcello Santos...

## How'd you know my daddy?
Met him through Santos... Clyde - your daddy - had some sorta business deal with Santos.

## Lula, you there?
Yeah, I'm here.

## You upset with me?
No, Sailor darlin'. Just shockin' sometimes when things aren't the way you thought they were... I been carryin' a secret too...

## Well, we're really out in the middle of it now, ain't we?
There's worse places, honey.

## What's that?
I don't know, honey, but we gotta help that girl - get her to a town and hope no one catches on I broke parole.

## You think she's gonna make it?
Don't know, but she's gonna bleed all over our car, I'll tell ya that... Hey... Hello... Girl... You gotta come with us, honey.

## She died right in front of me. Why'd she have to go and do that, Sailor?
Let's get outta here, honey.

## Now what?
Let's get a sandwich and find out about some work.

## Yeah?
This ain't exactly my most thrillin' notion of startin' a new life.

## That you, Sail, honey?
The only one.

## You find any work?
I barfed. Tried to make it to the bathroom... Turned out it was the wrong door anyways... I sorta got it cleaned up.

## Yeah?
Come sit by me.

## Anything I can do for you?
No, I don't think so, Sail. I just need to lie down.

## Sailor? You know what?
I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.

## Can't tell yet. Where'd you go?
That smell's still fillin' this room good.

## So where'd you say you was?
Went with Bobby.

## Uh-huh?
Let's leave here.

## What could I be up to, Lula?
He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.

## I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?
That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.

## What?
Was a massacre. Soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped 'em in a trench. Bobby Peru prob'ly killed the most.

## How can you say that, Sailor?
You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story.

## Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?
If you mean Sailor, mama, yes I am.

## I ain't that dumb, mama. Sailor and I been on a crime spree? Knockin' off convenience stores all across the south? Ain't you read about it?
Lula? I love you, baby. I just want you to be all right.

## What time's Sailor's train get in?
Six.

## Got any plans?
Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.

## What if I asked you not to?
Wouldn't make any difference.

## What if I told you not to?
Mama... if you get in the way of me and Sailor's happiness, I'll fuckin' pull your arms out by the roots.

## I'm sure I wouldn't know, ma'am... and buffalo hunting too... hmmmmm?
And jus when my baby's out on some Texas road with a killer.

## What do you want me to do about it?
I want you to take care of Sailor, so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again.

## Take care of him?
Yes.

## What does take care of him mean? Do you want me to give him food or some clothing?
What's with you? You know what take care of him means. I don't call Santos except for one big reason.

## Get rid of him?
Yes... Get rid of him.

## Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin' this stupid game?
Just tell me what you want.

## Simple? Kill him? How?
That's your business... I don't care how.

## Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
Santos...

## Shoot him? Like with a gun?
Yes.

## Where? In the leg?
No.

## Where?
In the head.

## Through the forehead?
Yes.

## Why didn't you send Johnnie Farragut?
Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.

## You're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him?
No... But...

## What?
Put your shoulders back, I said.

## Santos... Where's J-J-Johnnie?
Shhhhhh... Thank you, gentlemen... I'll look after her now...

## Where we goin'?
Got word the kids are moving through Texas... I think an ending is being arranged there... Come on, lemme see a smile.

## ...Sailor Ripley... Can I talk to Lula?
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...

## Whattya mean?
Well, Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos...

## So?
You're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.

## Oh... Look at this... What do you want, snakeskin?
Just passin' through on my way to who knows where...

## By who?
I think Santos or Marietta Fortune.

## That's pretty simplistic, don't you think?
Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens.

## What he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. It lives in the mind.
Excuse me. Did you, or did you not, have a gun to his head?

## Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was about, why were you writing it?
That's just how my brain works, I guess.

## Hey. What are you guys doing here?
We're springing you, Leer. Get some pants on.

## I like what you've done with it. When's Captain Nemo moving in?
The candelabras were my Gran's.

## You all right, Professor Tripp?
Brimming. Say hello to my new friend, Miss Antonia... uh...

## Emily?
Your wife.

## Perfect. Well then, shall we?
Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.

## Isn't she?
It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort of... tinkering with it.

## Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it sometime this weekend. Think that might be possible?
I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical... juncture.

## You didn't actually purchase this car, did you. Trip?
It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.

## Trip?
She left me. Crabs.

## Left you...? Who? Emily?
This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.

## But. ...why didn't you say something, Tripp? I mean, what are we doing here?
I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, Tripp.

## Is that just beer?
Primarily. Although I gather you two staged a little raid on the Crabtree pharmacopoeia. You missed a few bottles, by the way.

## I'm sure. Where is everyone?
Sara and Walter declined. Guess they wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog.

## So. Is he any good?
No. Not yet he isn't.

## No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?
Shut up and drink.

## What's this guy's problem?
Just go around him.

## You stay there.
Where would we go?

## Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would sneak in here and read your book without asking you?
Gee, I don't know, Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.

## James? My James? What's happened?
Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped.

## Kidnapped? By who?
His parents.

## Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?
Maybe... I don't know.

## How bad is it for you?
Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit the new corporate profile.

## Which is?
Competence.

## What's to tell?
Plenty, I'm sure. But, for what it's worth...

## Jesus. There must be two dozen windows on that thing. How are we supposed to find his?
I told you. They keep him chained in the basement. Come on.

## Is he awake?
I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.

## Great. Between you and Officer Pupcik out there he can be the next Jean Genet. It's been awhile since somebody wrote a good book in jail.
So what's the problem?

## So -- what do we do now?
Find the jacket.

## Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?
First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.

## Want some help with that?
Don't touch it.

## So whose car is it?
My guess -- Vernon Hardapple.

## The hood jumper?
He said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his.

## Christ, Tripp. How did you know?
Call it a hunch.

## Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his?
Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer to jail, Crabs. I know that.

## Do you know he won't expel him?
No. But I don't think that matters.

## Me? What can I do?
Gee, I don't know, Crabs... Improvise. You're good at that.

## You peeked, didn't you?
I peeked.

## How are you -- is it Joe?
Jeff. Sorry. I didn't even know this was your house until about an hour ago.

## This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving this car?
It's mine.

## How long have you been having them?
The last month maybe.

## How long have you been smoking marijuana?
Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.

## That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently?
I've been trying to finish a book...

## Is that in my chart?
I spoke with the woman who saved your life. You're lucky she came along when she did.

## So is my friend... is Sara still here?
No. There's no one here.

## No, really...
Who's got a gun?

## Who the hell is that?
A Manhattan book editor murdering a Mormon girl's clutch.

## Let me get this straight. All that paper that went into the river. That was the only copy?
Fraid so.

## Hey, Vernon. Can I ask you a question?
Shoot.

## As long as it looks like her, I don't care. You know what I'm saying?
Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.

## No sweat. Only do me a favor?
Sure.

## Hello?
Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.

## Could you hold on a minute, honey?
Sara? Hi. It's Grady.

## Where are you, Grady? An elevator?
I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some things we need to talk about...

## You're in Kinship?
Yes. But that's not why I called...

## With Emily?
What? No. There's no one here. I'm just... just...

## Just what? Doing a little dusting?
...reconcile with Emily.

## Are you there to not reconcile with her?
Goodbye, Grady.

## Yea?
How you choose to live your own life is your business. But you be careful with that boy, Grady. With James. He belongs to somebody else.

## No! What gave you that idea?
Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent her a room.

## You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw?
Huh? Oh. Son of Fury. With Tyrone Power and Frances Farmer.

## You cold, James?
A little.

## So what are you doing out here?
It's colder in there.

## Heaven?
James. Don't leave just yet. There's something I think you ought to see.

## Is that really it?
That's really it.

## The one she wore on her wedding day?
So I'm told.

## Really?
Really.

## You're really good friends with the Chancellor, aren't you?
Pretty good. I'm friends with Dr. Gaskell, too.

## He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead dog when I see one.
I had to. Didn't I?

## Professor Tripp? Can I ask you a question?
Yea, James.

## You?
Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.

## Does she want to hear it was one of her professors?
I've got tenure.

## Whose tuba is that anyway?
Miss Sloviak's.

## Can I ask you something about her?
She is. Ah. Here we go...

## Most of the time he is, James. Some of the time he isn't. Now what do we have here?
Looks like... our old friend Mr. Codeine. That should take the pinch out of my ankle. Have one.

## Is he all right?
Mmhmmm... knap... sap...

## What's he saying?
Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the auditorium.

## I thought you might -- I don't know -- swallow your tongue or something. I guess you really miss her, huh?
Huh? Oh, no. This isn't Emily's. I just write in it.

## Want me to get that?
Sure.

## Who?
The guy on the phone.

## What'd he say?
He wanted to know if a Grady Tripp lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 with black interior.

## What'd you tell him?
Yes.

## Washed up?
Blocked.

## Professor Tripp?
Hm.

## How did I get here last night?
No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.

## And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad?
Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the English Department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia.

## How's that?
Well done, James.

## So where have you been staying?
The bus station.

## But James. I mean... How long?
A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection.

## Who?
I don't know... Me.

## Isn't this...?
Hm.

## Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you think's the matter with you?
She seemed to take it pretty well.

## Humboldt County?
Maybe...

## Glaucoma?
Colon cancer.

## Where's that?
Carvel.

## Carvel? Where's Carvel?
Outside Scranton.

## Your father worked in a mannequin factory?
Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my mom. She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before that, she'd been a dancer.

## What kind of dancer?
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.

## Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic school?
When we fall, we fall hard.

## This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again?
Kinship.

## Kinship. And what's here?
Unless I miss my bet... my wife.

## The one that left you?
That's right. That one.

## How can you tell?
You can see the outline of a butt.

## I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, exactly what point was it that you turned into Serpent Boy?
Probably about the time you gave me the codeine pills last night.

## What?
You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog.

## It wasn't her dog. It's her husband's -- Who said anything about girlfriend?
Thanks for the halo, James, but I've never done that much thinking ahead in my life -- ever.

## I don't know, James. I don't know why I do half the things I do. Who does? Why do you wear that coat?
It's warm.

## Because of my coat?
Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.

## Jealous? Of me?
But, last night...

## You coming?
In a minute. Get us a table.

## Want a bite?
No thanks.

## I eat.
What would you call them then?

## When?
When nobody's looking.

## You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?
Okay.

## Where you going?
Nowhere. You just sit here and... eat.

## Near Carvel?
Get out of here.

## Can I -- I mean -- do you mind -- if I wear this again. Professor Tripp?
Ah, wear whatever you want.

## Does she mean -- does she know about... her dog?
It's Walter's dog and yes, she does know. But let's spare her the details. Come on, your shoes are in the hail.

## I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp?
I'm a little worried, James.

## Professor Tripp...?
Yes, James.

## Me? Sure. Why?
Just checking.

## The answer's yes. I think. Yes. I don't know. Where are they exactly?
James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.

## Do?
I just mean, I -- I guess Emily isn't going to be there when you get home.

## Look, Hannah. When you get him home... make sure he's all right. Before you leave. Okay?
I would if I knew where I was taking him.

## Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives?
Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it.

## No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around?
I don't know -- maybe -- I don't think so.

## Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?

## The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James that day?
I told you, Sewickly Heights.

## That good, huh?
Walter just got it back from the framer today.

## Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...?
I think Walter would find this a little more than surprising.

## Is that Cristaile?
Hm.

## My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't, she?
If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.

## Has he asked to see the book yet?
Yes.

## And? Are you going to tell him?
No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.

## Not have it.
You had another one, didn't you? You have to see a doctor, Grady. First thing Monday morning. All right?

## No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
Well, no, I don't see any way. And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.

## Who's gun is that?
It's -- it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.

## Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk?
I heard.

## You heard? How?
A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.

## Did you confess?
Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.

## I'm kidding. Hello?
Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...

## Are you limping? Why are you limping?
Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...

## Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell you something.

## Who's that sitting in your car?
James Leer.

## What's he doing out there?
I'm sort of helping him work through some issues.

## Oh?
Inside.

## And the jacket?
Over there. In the backseat of the...

## Are you sure you parked it there?
Of course, I'm sure. Ah, Christ, the puberty police are back.

## Would Walter really press charges?
It's within the realm. He takes his souvenirs pretty seriously. And he was just a wee bit prickly this morning.

## You didn't happen to call the house last night, did you, Grady?
I think I might have.

## And what do you think you might have said?
I think I might've said I was in love with you.

## And what did you say?
I said it didn't sound like you.

## I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady?
I'm through improvising.

## Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?
I lost it all.

## Ouch. How many?
Dozens. It's very sad.

## Oh?
I guess you have to go on faith.

## Did you tell Walter?
I told Walter.

## Does he still love you?
It didn't come up.

## Did you just make that up?
In the hospital. I was kind of excited about it at the time, but then I was on pretty heavy painkillers.

## Why yes. How did you know?
Lucky guess.

## Who's he barking at now?
He's still barking at me. He's blind.

## Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing?
James is... I don't know...

## Forget it. I should've known better. Your friend is just, I don't know, into collecting weird tricks. Mind?
He's writing his name in water.

## What's that?
Like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one.

## Jesus. Is that what he told you?
He said he hasn't had a success in ten years and everyone in New York thinks he's kind of a...

## Who's this ?
It's Grady, Walter.

## Grady?
GRADY Tripp. English Department.

## I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it?
It's three-thirty, Grady.

## Oh?
I... I...

## What is it, Grady?
I'm in love with your wife.

## Excuse me?
Sara. I'm in love with her.

## Is it good?
I don't know. It might be...

## Well, jeez, you're reading his biography, aren't you?
Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub all kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground lamb.

## Who's that guy?
Her husband.

## What exactly are we doing here, Professor Tripp?
Taking the long way home.

## Do you get high, Sam?
Only when I'm working.

## Holy shit. Are you serious?
As a heart attack.

## What made you pull out that old thing?
I was thinking of you.

## And?
It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you know that. It's a young man's book. It got me remembering how it felt to be young.

## Where's Emily, Hank?
I don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, Grady.

## Where you stand?
I -- just want to say I'm sorry.

## Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley together.

## Horses, right. Vernon something... Hardapple.
Why did you come here, Grady?

## I could be wrong. What happened anyway?
Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's closet. And the dog's missing.

## George Sanders?
Mr. Crabtree was saying how George Sanders killed himself, only he couldn't remember how.

## I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in here. You haven't seen it, have you?
I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.

## You doing okay?
Got a job at old Frank's place. His son runs it now.

## Yeah, you still with Northland?
Foreman now.

## Beautiful. How's business?
Booming. Lots of building going on. We can't keep up with all the work. In fact, I just hired a few new guys...

## Hey, is that a school?
K through sixth.

## Something wrong with that?
I was just thinking of... the noise.

## I should go. Your sister worries, and when she worries she yells.
What?

## How is she?
Annette? She's good... tense.

## When can I see her?
I'm working on it.

## Is it because of Anna?
I don't know. She won't talk about it.

## How old is Anna?
She'll be twelve next week. We're throwing a big party on Saturday. Wish I could ask you to come...

## What are you doing?
This little table is one heavy bitch.

## Huh?
It's made from cherry. That's a hard wood.

## Notice the grain. See how deep and rich the red runs?
Yeah. It's really nice.

## What's happening?
Mariners are pounding the shit out of the Tigers.

## What party?
The birthday party.

## I've got some pictures. Want to see?
No thanks.

## What's that?
Annette will see you.

## When?
Soon.

## Next week? The week after?
Early July.

## Isn't it?
The important thing is that you and Annette need to talk. She needs to see you, and you need to see her.

## Carlos, can I ask you something?
Sure.

## What do you mean?
I mean... feelings.

## What are you looking at?
Birds.

## There's little chicks! You want to see?
Sure.

## Is that right?
I don't like starlings.

## Why not?
They're extremely aggressive birds. Plus, their habits are rather filthy.

## You always carry these?
When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here.

## How does it sound?
It's hard to describe.

## Not too far. Are you a bird-watcher too?
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.

## Were you watching me?
Not at first. You would stare at the tops of the trees so intently. Any second I thought you would take off and fly.

## Do you come here often?
My daddy likes me home before dark.

## See anything interesting?
Not yet.

## What are you writing in that book?
It's my bird book.

## Don't you have friends?
I have friends.

## What does that mean?
It means uncommon beauty is commonly overlooked. Most people only notice birds with the brightest colors.

## What's up?
Have a seat.

## You don't know?
I have no idea.

## Why don't you just tell me?
I haven't broken any laws.

## Doesn't everybody?
I could get a search warrant.

## Cherry?
Yeah.

## You can't talk to me like --
Who said I wanted to buy it?

## Okay?
Okay.

## What?
Your ivy. Too much direct sunlight. These plants don't like a lot of sun.

## You going to take me on a nature walk?
I fell asleep.

## Do you believe in them?
No.

## The one with the ax?
I don't know.

## What?
The girl.

## I'll be asking the questions. Last night, you hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts?
No.

## A man was badly beaten across the street. You know anything about that?
I was asleep.

## What's with the boxes?
You're a cop. Figure it out.

## The passionate one?
Yes.

## You sure you don't know nothing about this?
Fraid not.

## So. How are you adjusting?
I'm adjusting okay.

## And your new apartment?
Apartment's okay.

## Are you taking your medication?
It gives me headaches.

## But you are taking it?
Yeah.

## Sergeant Lucas. May I come in?
You are in.

## What?
The new man. I'd keep away from him, if I were you.

## Why's that?
You don't want to know, but he's damaged goods -- real damaged goods, if you know what I mean.

## Lovers' quarrel?
People have the right to know.

## Can I ask how old you are?
I'm twelve.

## Do you have many friends?
No.

## How come?
A long time ago, I was sent far away. When they let me come back, all my friends were gone.

## Would you like to sit on my lap?
No thank you.

## Are you sure?
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.

## Do you want me to sit on your lap?
They sound like finches.

## Does he?
Yes.

## What's her name?
Ms. Kramer.

## What will happen if I do?
Someone will talk to your daddy. And then he'll stop doing those things... the things you don't like.

## But will he... ?
Your daddy will always love you.

## How do you know?
I know because... it's just something I know.

## Do you still want me to sit on your lap?
No.

## Can't I stay a little longer?
It's getting dark. Go home.

## And how's your job?
The job's okay.

## Do I take \"okay\" to mean you feel good about working there?
I said the job is okay.

## That's right, you did. Have you made any friends there?
I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.

## What?
I'd like you to keep a journal.

## A diary?
That's right.

## Why not?
Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.

## How's that?
Try it.

## How's the journal?
I'm still thinking about it.

## You don't like coming here, do you?
It's okay.

## Good. That's an honest answer. And why don't you like coming here?
Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch.

## Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
Forget it.

## How do you feel about that?
I don't feel anything.

## Then why are you talking about this?
Have to talk about something.

## What are you afraid will happen?
I'm not afraid. I'm just saying that Carlos has a thing for his daughter, and if he isn't careful he's going to suffer.

## Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
I'm not that crazy.

## Why do you think you're here?
You know why. It's part of the parole deal.

## Is that what you are angry about?
Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round.

## How long is this going to take?
We have a few more minutes.

## Will I ever be normal?
I couldn't say.

## Do you know what \"normal\" is?
I suppose it's however society defines it.

## How do you define it?
I don't.

## Then how do you know if your patients are getting better?
They usually tell me.

## What is your idea of being a Jew?
Whatever my ideas are of being a Jew is not going to help you. Why don't we continue this on Thursday.

## What did you think would happen?
I don't know.

## You know that if anything happens, I spend the rest of my life in prison. No parole, no nothing.
What did you want to happen?

## We'll talk about it more on Thursday.
Is this the first one?

## Remember when you asked me what my idea of \"normal\" was?
Go home, Walter.

## You mean my problem?
If by \"problem\" you mean your desire for prepubescent girls, yes.

## What?
I'd like you to close your eyes.

## Why?
To relax.

## Okay. Eyes closed, mind a blank. I'm all yours. Do it, Rosen.
Hey, Rosen, you going to hypnotize me?

## In your mind, Walter. Take your time.
When I say the word \"girl\" what is the earliest image that you can remember?

## Who do you see?
I see my sister.

## Sorry. Where is she?
In my bedroom, sleeping.

## Where are you?
In my bed too.

## How old are you and your sister?
We're little kids.

## But roughly, how old?
I'm maybe about six... which would make her four.

## And what are you doing?
Just lying there. We're taking a nap.

## I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been there.
A nap?

## Walter, what did you do while taking a nap with your sister?
Nothing.

## Okay I'll tell you what I did -- just to shut you up! I smelled her hair.
Did you touch her? Did you take off her clothes? Did you take off your clothes?

## What else?
That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.

## I smelled her hair. That's it. I just liked smelling her hair.
Did you get an erection?

## Accept you?
It's going to take time, Walter.

## How do you feel about that?
I feel... okay.

## Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fucking fantastic.

## Want a ride?
I'm all right.

## What picture?
I'm talking about you.

## Me?
Yeah, you.

## What's weird about that?
Most women wouldn't choose it.

## What do you think?
Southern light.

## What?
Your windows face south. Northern light is the purest. But southern light is very good.

## You plan to drink both those beers?
Sorry.

## Is that a school?
K through sixth.

## Doesn't it get noisy?
I like the noise.

## What about them?
They could eat you.

## What?
You're damaged.

## Yeah?
I'm not easily shocked.

## Are you going to tell me your deep dark secret before we have sex?
It's been a while since...

## Since you've had sex?
Tell me about it.

## The morning?
I thought I'd stay the night.

## What for?
Well, Walter, this is going to sound off-the-wall, but I like to sleep with a man after we fuck.

## Did I say something wrong?
I suffer from insomnia.

## Is that all?
When I do sleep, I sweat a lot. Usually I get nightmares and wake up screaming.

## I sleep like a dead horse. Anything else?
Hey, there.

## Why do you want to know?
Because I like you.

## The worst?
Yeah.

## So, what did you do?
I molested little girls.

## Molested little girls?
Yeah.

## How many girls did you molest?
Sorry.

## What did you do to them?
It's not what you think.

## How young?
I never hurt them. Never.

## Why don't you just go now, okay?
I told you I'm not easily shocked.

## What?
Get your kicks somewhere else.

## You don't molest little girls anymore, do you?
No. Never again.

## Yes! I want to know.
What was prison like?

## You mean the time you're locked away?
No. Prison is time. That's it. You think time, you feel time, you hear time. Your heart doesn't beat to live, it just beats... time.

## Why young girls, Walter?
Is it their innocence? Their beauty?...

## They seduce you?
I was always the one seduced.

## You really believe that?
No. That's what I used to tell myself.

## And what do you tell yourself now?
Nothing. It's over.

## What?
Being here, with me.

## For men like me. They say most of us end up back... there. I'm saying there are risks... seeing me.
What odds?

## Why not tell me now?
I got poked around... here and there.

## Which brother did this?
All three -- in chronological order.

## Not ever?
Not ever.

## What?
Us seeing each other.

## Who doesn't?
Most people don't have my kind of problems.

## What's it look like?
I don't need a plant.

## Do what?
Sneak up behind me like that.

## What's going on?
Nothing.

## Do you want to talk about it?
I need a shower.

## You okay?
Yeah.

## Goddamnit! D'you tell him we need it right now?
I told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked ASAP.

## We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests. If you were married you got a state-room. Otherwise it was bunks.
Where're you?

## Okay, good reason. Then what?
No way that could just be seawater.

## How you guys doing?
I'm alright, I'm dealing.

## You got it?! You got it?
Yeah, yeah... yeah. It's turning.

## What is that? You drop your dive light?
Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig.

## Where are we?
Missile compartment. Those are the launch tubes.

## Hey, you okay?
Deep and slow, big guy. Deep and slow. Just breathe easy.

## Thanks. How you feeling, big guy?
Figured I was dead, there, when I seen that angel comin' toward me.

## I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here. Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?
My rig. I designed the damn thing.

## Who else?
I can't believe you were dumb enough to come down. Now you're stuck here for the storm... dumb, hot-rod... dumb.

## You wanna know what I think?
Not particularly. Jeez, look where this is set! Morons.

## What are you still wearing that for?
I don't know. Divorce ain't final. Forgot to take it off.

## So what about \"Michael\" then... Mr. Brooks Brothers... Mr. BMW. You still seeing him?
No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.

## What happened?
Bud, why are you doing this? It's not part of you life any more.

## Did you get anything on the cameras. Video or anything?
No. Look, forget it. I don't want to talk about it.

## But you think it's something else. What? One of ours?
No.

## Cute, Virgil.
But what did he see that made him panic?

## What's the scoop, ace?
I can get power to this module and sub-bay if I remote these busses. I've gotta get past the mains, which are a total melt-down.

## What about O-2?
Brace yourself. We've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we're not using.

## I need you to believe me, Bud. Look at me. Do I seem stressed out? Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
No.

## How can I go on a feeling? You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
I think it likes you.

## Now what?
Okay, I'm gonna free-swim to hatch six... get inside, get the door open from the other side.

## Then I guess you better wish me luck, huh?
You owe me one, Virgil.

## You totaled it, huh?
Yeah. So sue me.

## You see where it's coming in?
Somewhere behind this panel. Hold this.

## Can't get to it. Have to pull this panel off. You go any tools?
I don't know, look around.

## Listen... will you listen to me for a second!? You're for the suit on and you're a better swimmer than me. Right? So I got a plan...
How?

## WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!?
It is insane.

## Hey... big boys don't cry, remember?
Hi, lady.

## Hi, tough guy. I guess it worked, huh?
Course is worked. You're never wrong, are you? How d'you feel.

## I've been better. Next time it's your turn, okay?
No, Bud, no... not you.

## Who then?
Hello, Brigman.

## Did you find Wilhite?
No.

## Virgil?
God, I hate that bitch.

## What's the matter with you?
Now we're right in the middle of this big-time international incident. Like the Cuban Missile Crisis or something.

## Do we just leave him there?
Yeah, for now. Our first priority's to get something to breathe.

## Why bring it here?
Lins, stay away from that guy. I mean it.

## Yeah. The dude's in bad shape... you see his hands?
Got it. Over.

## Is that it? Is this right?
Hafta... go on to... the moonpool. Only way.

## Missed what?
Y'all could be more specific.

## Turn it up, bozo.
What good's the money if your dick drops off in six months?

## That thing was probably their version of Big Geek... like an ROV.
Are we talkin' little space friend here?

## Lady, we better fish or cut bait.
Just checking is out, huh? How come?

## Just hold your water, okay? So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk about it?
We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.

## Cab One, radiation readings?
Neutron counter's not showing very much.

## Copy that, continuing forward. You just want me to get shots of everything, right?
Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving. We're on a tight timeline.

## How many are there?
24 Trident missiles. Eight MIRVs per missile.

## You're right... I don't. I just need to know that this thing is out of here! You hear me, Roger Ramjet?
Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on final approach.

## Gotcha, Cab Three. Who is that? That You, Lindsey?
Cab Three, check. Right behind you.

## What's you depth, Cab Three?
1840... 50... 60... 70...

## Figured that out for yourself, did you?
A non-terrestrial intelligence.

## Look, you can just punch into his little chip where you want him to go, and he goes, right?
Let's go for it. We could get lucky.

## Shut up, Hippy. Bud, how you doing?
Uh, oh...

## What kind of luminous things, Bud?
Fluid breathing system. We just got them. We use it if we need to go really deep.

## How deep?
Deep. It's classified... you know. Anyway, you breathe liquid, so you can't be compressed. Pressure doesn't get to you.

## Getting a reading?
High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome. Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first. Nausea, increased excitability, disorientation.

## 8500 feet, Bud. Everything okay?
Ask him a pressure effects. Tremors, vision problems, euphoria.

## What kind of light?
He's hallucinating badly.

## Would we see the flash?
Through three miles of water? I don't know.

## When do you have to go back?
I don't know... It depends on Ettore... He's now in the process of negotiating for a contract here in Sicily...

## I'd like to find a place where I can get some peace and rest, maybe around here somewhere. I'd like to try...
Then how come you're not with him?

## Fine. Can't you see so yourself?
Anna... Maybe it would be better to wait a while.

## Wait for what?
Sandro... A month is too long a time. I have become used to being without you.

## But I think we should talk about it. Or are you fully convinced that we too won't understand each other?
There will be plenty of time to talk about it later. We'll get married soon. That way we'll have more time...

## But where are you going?
I'm thirsty.

## Did you sleep well?
Yes, fairly well. But I went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things ... instead, I fell asleep.

## Which one shall I wear?
This one is gorgeous.

## Claudia, aren't you coming?
I'm certainly not going to swim across.

## Isn't it fashionable any more to put on a sailor's cap with the name of the yacht?
No, Dad, it isn't.

## And how long will you be away?
Four or five days.

## Used to what?
To the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father.

## And have you any other truths to tell me?
You already know what they are.

## It's already two hours... What are we going to do?
It takes about twenty to twenty-two hours for the current to reach here from Lisca Bianca.

## And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?
Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.

## What is that one over there called?
That must be Basiluzzo.

## At what?
At the ruins. They're very ancient, you know.

## Have you decided?
All I said was that it sounds like a good idea.

## More so than the shark?
There's no comparison.

## But Anna wouldn't be staying with the kind of people who live here.
Then why don't we go up and see the ruins?

## Really! Still, it remains to be seen why she invented a shark. What was her purpose in that?
Maybe you'd better ask him.

## But of course... arrogant, haughty... Hasn't Anna ever told you?
There's nothing much to laugh at.

## Shall we go for a swim?
Oh, no... please... not here. It looks too dangerous.

## I'm beginning to have my doubts. It couldn't be that they're in love?
Could be. They're the kind of people who are capable of anything.

## Find anything?
No.

## And why do you tell us this only now?
I... I don't know... I didn't think it was worthwhile... She was laughing over it...

## But why don't you tell him? A girl who was with us has disappeared.
And how do you explain that?

## And I suppose it's my fault... Why don't you tell him that too. That's what you believe, isn't it?
Rather than being so occupied with my thoughts, you would have been better off trying to understand what Anna was thinking.

## Are you feeling better?
I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.

## You're very fond of Anna, aren't you?
Yes, very much so.

## Has she ever spoken to you about me?
Occasionally, but always with affection.

## Where are you going?... To Montaldo's?
Yes.

## Sandro, I don't want you to come with me, I don't want to see you... How can I make it clear to you?...Why did you come?
I don't know why. I just couldn't help it.

## I'm sorry. I didn't want to sound cynical. But isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye?
It takes even less.

## And what about you?
Me... I... I... Please leave me alone.

## Any news?
Yes... but it's all so conflicting... However, there is some slight indication...

## What is it, Claudia?
Oh, Sandro... I'm so ashamed of myself, so ashamed...I tried to hide myself...I feel so small... I hate myself ...

## Does it please you to say such things?
Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...

## Then why do you say them?
Because what I'm doing is so ugly ... Because if you told me right now, \"Claudia, I love you,\" I would believe you...

## Why are you looking at me like that?
I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.

## Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say?
You look at me as though I had said something foolish...

## And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?
That's why I asked you...

## But why am I so infatuated with you?
Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...

## So, you wonder why?
Then I'll see you later.

## Sandro ...What's the matter?
Nothing.

## Why?
No reason why...

## What are you saying?
I was only joking, really... Can't I make a joke? And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to.

## Did the hotel manager speak to you about that place nearby?
Yes, she started to but I didn't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say. If we had to listen to everybody...

## Aren't you going to change?
You said you wanted to quit working for Ettore.

## Why?
I'm too sleepy.

## You're that sleepy, eh? What time do expect to get up tomorrow?
Late, very late.

## Tell me, Claudia, what do you think of Raimondo?
I would say he's pretty depraved.

## He amuses me. I don't know of anything more amusing. Outside of this jigsaw puzzle. Don't you find it so, Claudia?
One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.

## Not really... It's suffocating in here... Shall we go out?
What amazes me, is Sandro. He seems so calm.

## To do what?
It was futile. We went all over.

## Do you consider that a compliment?
No.

## Shouldn't we try to find a quieter place?
Quieter? Oh, yes, of course.

## What do you mean by sensible?
It means being without money.

## Patrizia... Patrizia ... Where's Ettore?
I imagine he must be inside sleeping.

## Who are you talking to?
To the shark.

## Please, do come... Don't leave me alone with him. He's capable of... I don't know... Have you noticed his eyes?
They're all nudes, if I'm not mistaken.

## But why all nudes?
It couldn't be any clearer.

## Now what do I have to do to be left in peace?
I think all you have to do, Giulia, is to close the door.

## But Corrado... If something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so?
He never misses a chance to humiliate me, to let me know that he doesn't care about me any more.

## But why?... What if it starts to rain?
If it rains, I'll buy myself an umbrella.

## Corrado, why don't you ask them to give it to us as a gift?
Really! So that you can stuff it with your geraniums.

## But how can you carry on a discussion in this heat?
When one approaches fifty, my dear, he is affected only by the cold.

## Me?... I no longer have any interest in building... And, then, where can you find boulders of rock like this in Milan?
Then let's get started... It's senseless to waste any more time.

## And what are we going to do now?
We'll try again.

## So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible, then, that Anna...?
I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.

## But for what reason would she have wanted to go away?
I think it's possible.

## This is Claudia, Anna's friend... You've never met my husband, have you?
First let the poor thing have something to eat.

## What is it?
Nothing, nothing at all. I was just looking for Sandro.

## Where is she going?
Ask her.

## I know we are. But as the years go by, we become even worse. Isn't that so, Corrado?
Goffredo is the Princess' nephew. He's eighteen years old, the lucky boy. And, what do you know -- he paints.

## And where do you find the models?
Oh, there are as many as one wants.

## I thought the model was something obsolete nowadays. Didn't you, Claudia?
It's strange how anxious women are to display themselves. It's almost a natural inclination.

## Why don't you try?
Me... Goffredo, you're mad! He's mad.

## Don't you ever paint men?
Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint you a beautiful portrait.

## They tell me you have a lot of trouble at home. Is that right?
Yes, sir. My sister is sick... and my father, too.

## Now look, my men saw it and they also saw you men throwing those crates overboard. What have you got to say about that?
I ... I ... wasn't feeling well ... I.. I was sleeping... I don't know anything ... I ... I'm all mixed up and ...

## And who is she? Does she work in Catania?
Yes, she takes care of the garden.

## And what did they say about me?
They told me that you were a very nice girl, that you always mind your business... In other words, things of that sort.

## And why wouldn't we have one like this?
Because this is a Chinese radio.

## But for you, what comes first, music or love?
Music, of course. To get a sweetheart, one has to look around, but to get a radio, all you have to do is buy one.

## Anything new develop?
Unfortunately, no.

## And do you remember where she got off?
Well...probably at the last stop, which is Noto.

## Then you should also be able to tell me where a young girl might stay in Noto; are there any hotels or rooming houses?
There's the Trinacria Hotel... or the Regina, near the municipal building. As for rooming houses, I don't know...

## Are you the owner of this place?
No. The owners are in Australia.

## Just a moment ago... didn't you hear the sound of a motor?
At this time of the year there are so many boats...

## Early? Is four in the morning early for you?
Perhaps she wasn't feeling well... Maybe a cramp or something...

## Patrizia, what are you going to do?
What do you want us to do? I don't know myself... But we'll do something.

## And here's Sandro. Why don't you two go upstairs and change?
Yes, we will.

## Did you manage to find good rooms?
They didn't seem too good.

## Raimondo... Do you enjoy fishing underwater?
I detest it. But, after all, what can you do... It's the latest...and I try my best to adapt myself.

## Take it easy, Raimondo. Why are you getting so impatient?
Here I am, Patrizia. I'm always here.

## Zuria?
Yes. Until proven otherwise.

## Wait a moment. Can't you see I'm busy?
I read one of your articles regarding the disappearance of a girl. I'm that girl's fianc.

## Is that far from here?
About fifty miles or so. If you want, I'll give you the name of the storekeeper.

## Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor?
Then let's call it a business proposition. Something to round out your salary.

## He talked to you Himself?
No.

## Through someone else?
Yes.

## Who?
I can't say.

## Why?
She'd punish me.

## One of the other Sisters?
No.

## Who?
Because I'm getting fat.

## Who told you this?
It's a sin to be fat.

## Why?
Look at the statues, they're thin.

## Who tells you these things?
Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.

## Who?
Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen.

## Why?
I don't know.

## Sister Marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress Sister. Is that true?
Yes Mother.

## Why?
In the medieval days the nuns and monks would sleep in their own coffins.

## Then tell me. Where are your sheets?
I burnt them.

## Why?
They were stained.

## What do you mean?
It's not my time of month.

## For what?
I don't know... I don't know...

## Hello. I'm Doctor Livingston. I've been asked to talk to you. May I?
Yes.

## Was it Sister Marguerite?
No I'm not.

## Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
Let's talk about something else.

## Anything... may I sit down?
Yes.

## First thing that comes to your mind?
God! But there's nothing to say about God.

## Have you ever loved anyone?
Yes.

## Who?
Everyone.

## Right now?
Uh huh.

## Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?
Yes.

## Who?
Oh, there are so many.

## Do you think he loves you?
Oh, I know he does.

## He's told you?
No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.

## You've been alone together?
Yes.

## Often?
At least once a week.

## And you like that?
Oh, yes.

## Where do you meet?
In the confessional.

## Would you like to talk about it?
I never saw any baby... I think they made it up.

## Why should they?
I don't know.

## Do you remember the night they said it came?
No. I was sick.

## How were you sick?
Something I ate.

## Did it hurt?
Yes.

## Where?
Down... there.

## And what did you do?
I went to my room.

## And what happened?
I got sicker.

## And then what?
I fell asleep.

## In the middle of all the pain?
Yes.

## What baby?
The baby they made up.

## Where'd it come from before that?
From God.

## Don't you know?
Yes I do, but I want you to...

## What do you mean?
Just that... you ask and I'll answer.

## Anything?
Anything.

## What's your real name?
Martha Louise Livingston.

## Are you married?
No.

## Would you like to be?
Not at the moment, no.

## Do you have any children?
No.

## Would you like some?
I can't have them any more.

## Does it bother you?
No questions.

## Where do you think babies come from?
From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know.

## Why should I?
I don't know.

## You liked Sister Paul?
She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.

## What else did she tell you?
She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.

## Sister Paul was in her eighties? Did she climb up here often?
No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.

## Like what?
Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end.

## I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.

## What happens if the bell rings and you're under there?
Oh, it's even more wonderful then.

## Oh, no place as wonderful as this. Agnes... have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else?
No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.

## You have trouble sleeping?
I get headaches. Mommy did too... oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew things that nobody else knew.

## What things?
She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.

## How did she know that?
Somebody told her.

## Who?
I don't know.

## I promise I won't laugh. Who told her?
An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.

## Did your mother see angels often?
No.

## Do you?
No.

## Do you believe she really saw them?
No, but I can never tell her that.

## Why not? Mmm?
She'd get angry.

## Agnes, did you love your mother?
Yes.

## Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
I could never be a mother.

## Why not?
Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby.

## Why not?
Because I don't want one.

## If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
From someone who didn't want to have a baby.

## How would that person get one if they didn't want one?
A mistake...

## Agnes, how did your mother get you?
A mistake... it was a mistake...

## Is that what she said?
Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...

## What the child?
Everything... I don't have children.

## But you're troubled... aren't you?
That's because you keep reminding me. If you go away then I'll forget.

## Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
Agnes...

## What did you do?
I'm always bad.

## I breathed!
No...

## She's dead isn't she?
Yes.

## How?
She watches... she listens.

## Yes?
... makes me...

## Yes?
... take off my clothes and then... she makes fun of me.

## She tells you you're ugly?
Yes.

## And that you're stupid?
Yes.

## That you're a mistake?
She says my whole body's a mistake.

## Why?
Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby.

## How does she know that?
Her headaches.

## What?
She touches me down there with a cigarette. Please Mommy, don't touch me like that any more. I'll be good, I won't be a baby any more.

## Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
No I'm not.

## Are you pretty?
Yes.

## Are you intelligent?
Yes I am.

## Do you really love me or are you just saying that?
I really love you.

## As much as Mother Miriam does?
As much as God loves you.

## Who am I?
Doctor Livingston.

## And why am I here?
To help me.

## Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
Because I'm in trouble.

## What kind of trouble? What kind of trouble Agnes?
I'm frightened.

## Of what?
Of telling you.

## But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
I had a baby.

## How did you have a baby?
It came out of me.

## Did you know what was going to come out?
Yes.

## Did you want it to come out?
No.

## Why?
Because I was afraid.

## Why were you afraid?
Because I wasn't worthy.

## To be a mother?
Yes.

## No not yet Agnes, very soon but not yet. How did the baby get into you?
It grew.

## What made it grow? Do you know?
Yes.

## Would you like to tell me?
No.

## Did anyone else know about the baby?
I can't tell you that.

## Will she be angry?
She made me promise not to.

## Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
Fish... ... brussel sprouts.

## You don't like brussel sprouts?
I hate them.

## And then what happened?
We went to chapel for vespers.

## What is it?
Someone's following me.

## Who?
Sister Marguerite I think.

## What else?
A crucifix.

## Above the bed? Any... anything else? What do you you see, something different? What is it?
A wastepaper basket.

## Do you know who put it there?
No.

## What do you think it's there for?
For me to get sick in.

## Are you ill?
Yes.

## What do you feel?
I feel as if I've eaten glass.

## What do you do?
I have to throw up...

## Of what?
Of me. Oh... God! My God... Water... it's all water...

## Why isn't anyone coming?
They can't hear me that's why. Oh God... I don't wanna...

## Who?
Go away, I don't want you here.

## Is someone in the room with you?
No... don't hit me please...

## Do you remember what just happened?
Yes.

## That's good. Do you feel well enough to stand?
Yes.

## Agnes, can you hear me?
Yes.

## What did she mean?
The statue. She had shown it to me the day before.

## And the passage to the barn?
Yes.

## Why?
So I could go to him.

## Who?
Him.

## How did she know about him?
She'd seen him too.

## Where?
From the belltower the day she before she died.

## So she sent you?
Yes.

## Are you frightened?
Yes.

## Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?
No...

## Agnes who did you see?
I hate him...

## Of course you do. Who was it?
I hate him for what he did to me.

## Who?
I hate him.

## Agnes, who did this to you?
God! It was God. And now I'll burn in hell because I hate him.

## It was alive wasn't it?
I don't remember.

## Mother Miriam was with you wasn't she?
Yes.

## She took the baby in her arms?
Yes.

## You saw it all didn't you?
Yes.

## What did you do?
I put her to sleep.

## H... how?
I tied the cord around her neck... wrapped her in the bloody sheets... and stuffed her in the trash can.

## What?
Look into the convent records.

## Why?
The bishop is breathing down our necks.

## And the sooner she goes to prison, the better off she'll be?
Here you are. Don't let anyone know where you got them.

## Marty, what are you doing here?
Larry there's got to be something missing.

## I gave you the pictures Marty, what else do you want?
Something they... that they overlooked.

## What? You think that the girl is innocent?
I don't know.

## You're too involved Marty. Jesus look at you. Why don't you turn this case over to someone else?
Thanks.

## You have proof?
I'll have it.

## When?
Next week.

## Who are you?
It's Martha, Mama. There you go.

## Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right?
I... I'm Martha, Mama.

## How do you survive?
Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves, some wheat, corn, some vegetables.

## Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you?
No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.

## Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room?
Oh that one there, in the corner.

## The one up on the third floor?
Yes.

## What does this have to do with..?
And you had a sister who died in the convent.

## What business is it of yours..?
Oh, we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case.

## I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?
Well somone's got to suffer for this Doctor. You've got to be merciful and quick. Excuse me.

## You were a smoker?
Two packs a day.

## Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?
No-one.

## How did she hide it from the other nuns?
She undressed alone... she bathed alone.

## Is that normal?
Yes.

## How did she hide it during the day?
She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to.

## Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.

## Who was the father?
I haven't a clue.

## What man had access to her?
None as far as I know.

## Was there a priest?
Yes, but I...

## What's his name?
Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.

## Could there have been anyone else?
Obviously there was.

## And you didn't try to find out who?
Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.

## She can't even remember the birth. Do you think she'd admit to the conception?
Look, someone gave her the baby.

## Why do you think that?
Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.

## What's your opinion?
I believe Agnes is different.

## How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.

## If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
So, someone else could have done it.

## And in your eyes?
I've already told you what I thought.

## Who?
No-one knew about Agnes' pregnancy. No-one. Not even Agnes.

## When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?
Shortly after she came to us.

## And you weren't shocked?
I was appalled, just as you are now.

## And what happened?
She stopped eating completely...

## This was before her pregnancy?
About two years before.

## Why didn't you take her to a doctor?
It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...

## I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.

## What?
Nuns... you hate nuns.

## What?
Aquittal.

## How?
Innocence. Legal innocence. I know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court.

## When would Agnes have conceived the child?
Oh, some time in January.

## Earthquakes?
Visitors to the convent.

## Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
Yes.

## Was the child full term?
Oh, Dear God...

## What is it?
The sheets...

## What sheets?
Oh, Dear God, I should have guessed...

## When was that?
The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.

## Sister Paul?
Yes. I don't remember where Agnes was. I was needed in the sick room.

## Like keeping her home from school?
Yes.

## Listening to angels?
She drank too much. That's what killed her.

## Do you know what she did to her?
I don't think I care to know.

## Why didn't you do anything to stop her?
Because I didn't know...

## And my permission?
I'd like yours too.

## Then why did you call the police in the first place Mother, huh?
Because I am a moral person.

## What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
Nothing...

## Stupid woman... and that's all?
That's all? That's enough! She was a beautiful little girl.

## So you left the Church because you had freckles?
No, because I... yeah, yeah I left the Church cause I had freckles.

## My sister died in a convent. And it's her voice I hear. Does my smoking bother you?
No, it reminds me.

## Would you like one? Huh?
I'd love one.

## All right?
Fine thanks...

## Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...

## Right...
Saint Peter?

## Mary Magdelen?
Oh, you've come a long way baby.

## Right. What do you suppose today's saints are smoking?
There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.

## Do you think they ever existed?
Yes I do.

## Do you want to become one?
Become? One is born a saint.

## Do you think Agnes is still attached to God?
Listen to her singing.

## Would it stop you if I did?
No.

## May I be present?
Of course.

## You're what?
If we want to hire a psychiatrist for Agnes. we'll find our own, thank you.

## For the Church?
For Agnes.

## You think she's a saint?
My God, you're as crazy as...

## How ?
This is insane.

## But how did it happen?
You'll never find the answer for everything God did.

## I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe.

## That's what you believe she is? The sum of her psychological parts?
That's what I have to believe...

## That's crazy. How could she find out about it?
Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.

## Who was that person Mother? Was it you?
If you believe this is murder, it is the Crown attorney you have to talk to, not me. And definitely not Agnes.

## Hasn't she had enough?
I have a few more questions to ask her.

## Who knew she was pregnant?
Why do you insist upon pressing...

## Did you know she was pregnant?
Yes.

## For what? An abortion?
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

## Too late for what?
I don't know... too late to stop it.

## The baby?
The scandal...

## Before or after you killed the child?
I left it with her and I went for help.

## Agnes, what happened to the baby?
She can't remember.

## Of course, John.
What happened to the baby?

## Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
How fascinating. Do go on ... ... John.

## Eh?
Lay them down.

## They are?
The cards... you're bank.

## Well! A boy of your age bowling \"hoop\" at people. How old are you anyway?
Nine.

## Y'what?
You heard, it gets on my wick.

## Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?
I'm a deserter.

## Are you now?
Yeah, I've blown school out.

## Just you?
No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.

## Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?
Yeah, that's right, they was supposed to come with us but they chickened.

## Yeah? And they're your mates are they?
Yeah.

## Not much cop without 'em, is it?
Oh, it's all right.

## Yeah?
Yeah.

## What they like?
Ginger's mad, he says things all the time and Eddy's good at punching and spitting.

## How about Ding Dong?
He's a big head and he fancies himself with it but you know it's all right 'cos he's one of the gang.

## Why aren't you at work?
I'm a deserter, too.

## Isn't it always the way? Picking on us little fellas.
What about all these letters?

## Can you fix him for me?
Yeah.

## Aren't you supposed to be in that box?
Leave them drums alone.

## Would you like to be a little more precise, sir?
Well, that's the wrong line for a start.

## Oh, yes, now I'm with you.  But, gee, Mister, I've got my license to think of ... we're doing a hundred now ...
Sorry?

## Ah ... a shamus, eh?
I see you go to the night court.

## Are you going in?
No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.

## Me? Why?
Bag-snatcher.

## Eh, Ringo, do you know what happened to me?
No. I don't.

## Well, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out and you'll learn it. Can he read?
Of course I can.

## I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
I'll have a bash.

## Good. Hart, get him whatever it is they drink, a cokearama?
Ta.

## Grotty?
Yeah, grotesque.

## And who's this Susan when she's at home?
Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.

## I beg your pardon?
She's a trend setter. It's her profession!

## A butcher?
Yeah, she was fickle.

## Did you look in here?
He's sulking again.

## Is he?
Come on, Auntie, you're winning.

## Should I say it?
Follow your impulse.

## How'd you like a dirty great drum roll giving you a clout right in the middle of your solo?
You're getting out of hand. I don't know what's come over you today.

## What are we waiting for?
Come here.

## Morning! Who's that little old man?
It's Paul's grandfather.

## Oh, sorry I spoke.
Well, what happened?

## I've got you worried, haven't I?
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.

## How'd you guess?
Oh, it's the way you talk.

## Are you pulling my leg?
Something like that.

## Thank you.
Gear?

## Don't mench ... well, why don't you give us a few more lines, like?
I'm not ...

## Oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?
No. I'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines.

## Oh, I see. You are an actress though, aren't you?
Yes.

## What's that mean?
Well, the way you were spouting, like .... \"I don't believe you, sir...\" and all that. Yeah, it was gear.

## The big hammer?
Oh aye, a sledge.

## Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
They ought to be.

## What are you?
I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.

## Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
What of? Look, I wouldn't do it unless I was. I'm dead lucky 'cos I get paid for doing something I love doing.

## Why selfish?
Well, you've got to have people to taste your treacle toffee.

## And you honestly think that's what she meant?
Well, it's nice to know you think we're clever.

## And what do you do about it?
You can learn from books.

## So you are a man after all.
Out where?

## What's that mean?
Oh ... I dunno.

## Yeah ... a bloomin' book!
And what's it all come to in the end?

## Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
You're only right.

## Ringo, me old scout, they grabbed yer leg for the iron too, did they?
Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.

## Have they?
Me!

## What are you doing?
Lip reading.

## What are they saying?
Nothing good.

## Is there a fire, then?
You ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.

## Eh?
I'll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.

## What's he on about?
I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.

## Would you two like a cup of tea?
You see, sly villains.

## And we're looking after him, are we?
I'll look after meself.

## Oh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time ... and who's paying for all this?
It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.

## A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
Oh, well that's all right. What?

## Why do you always use your left hand?
Well, don't be daft, I've got to.

## Anything to spare?
We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.

## And another thing, where's that old mixer?
Here, Pauly.

## Clean though, isn't he?
Oh yes, he's clean all right.

## Is that yours?
For Ringo.

## Well, what are we waiting for?
Aye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours is worse than any of you lot.

## What are you doing there?
Hiding.

## What little old man?
That little old man.

## How d'you reckon that one out?
Well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.

## Well we know that but what's he doing here?
Well, me mother thought the trip 'ud do him good.

## Eh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?
Him, he costs you a fortune in breach of promise cases. He's a villain and a right mixer as well.

## Shall I?
I hope he fell off.

## Like what?
Well, I've got me gob stopper. Look, a genuine Stradivarius, hand tooled at Dagenham.

## You won't interfere with the basic rugged concept of my personality, will you, girl?
Eh, don't take out me lines.

## What's he know?
Nothing, he's trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh, he's a swine but a clever swine, mind.

## What's old got to do with it?
You needn't bother.

## Y'what?
If you're going to have a barney I'll hold your coats.

## Eh, have you got Paul's grandfather?
Of course, he's concealed about me person.

## Please, can I have one to surge with?
No.

## Well, yes your nose is. Very.
What?

## Is it?
I would have said so.

## What have you heard?
It's all over the place, everyone knows.

## Is it? Is it really?
Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.

## Well, that's just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul?
It'll only get you into trouble.

## That's right. It's always me, isn't it?
Since you ask, yes. Aah, come on, Ring, we love you.

## And?
Your Grandfather pointed out Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me.

## Have you lost him?
Don't exaggerate.

## Eh, where's my grandfather?
Don't start. Look.

## None for me, then?
Sorry.

## What do you think are you're up to?
Someone put it on me.

## Do I have to raise me voice?
Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.

## Who?
Paul's grandfather.

## Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
Down the ... er ...

## Oh, down the ... er ...?
Yeah, down the ... er ...

## What?
Nerves.

## How's that?
Oh ... he's nursing a broken heart.

## Oh, he's gone to my club, has he?
Yeah, It's all your fault, getting invites to gambling clubs. He's probably in the middle of an orgy by now.

## Eh, what's all this?
Oh, him... He's been lurking.

## Shove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room or something and keep your eye on him, will you?
I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.

## Oh, a little savage, is he?
A proper Aborigine.

## Is that you, Roby?
I feel like shit...

## Are you in pain?
Not exactly, just feel like somebody's been beating me with rubber hoses for about six years.

## Dell, what's the last thing you can remember?
... I don't know...

## Where's Irth?
Sandy, scan the whole sky.

## Where the hell are we?
Just short of Zeta II Reticuli. We haven't even reached the outer rim yet.

## Can you get it a little closer?
That's what I'm going to do.

## Any rotation?
Yeah. Two hours.

## Gravity?
Point eight six. We can walk on it.

## Is it solid?
Receiving.

## What's up?
I'm on my way.

## What is it?
Take a look.

## You want to try?
Sure.

## Can we come up?
No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.

## Can you see anything in the hole?
Dell, you want to come down, we can figure out where to go from here.

## Are you okay in there?
Yeah, I'm okay. Haven't hit bottom yet. Definitely a column of warm air rising; it keeps the shaft clear of dust.

## What was that Dell, I lost you, do you read me?
Yeah, but this is hard work. Can't talk now.

## Don't you remember?
Don't remember nothing. Can't hardly remember my name.

## I'm really starving; can we get some food before we go into the freezers?
I think that's a pretty reasonable request.

## Computer, this is Captain Standard. What conditions are you talking about?
I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.

## A transmission?
A voice transmission.

## Computer, what language was that?
Unknown.

## Just hold it! Computer, have you attempted to analyze the transmission?
I have interrupted the course of the voyage.

## What? Why?
I am programmed to do so if certain conditions arise.

## Unknown! What do you mean?
The reaction has proceeded too far. The core has begun to melt. Engines will overload in 2 minutes, 35 seconds.

## How long to fix?
He died.

## What?
Not they...

## Sorry to interrupt, but I'm gonna charge up the engines for a minute, okay?
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.

## Yes? What is it?
Jay, we've got a problem. I was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability.

## Why, what's wrong?
The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.

## You like this shit?
It grows on you.

## You know what they make this stuff out of?
Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what? It's food now. You're eating it.

## Where's it coming from?
Machine's screwed up, I can't tell. Needle's spinning all over the dial.

## What happened to the lights?
Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em.

## Where does that go?
All over the ship; we'll have to check the charts to know for sure.

## What happened? Where's Sandy?
Dead.

## What the hell's going on?
Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.

## Hurt! How?
Well, we should at least be able to each buy our own planet.

## What was that? What the Christ was that?
And then we run out of food and oxygen.

## Jay... how's it coming on the repairs?
Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...

## And when will you be ready to do that?
Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.

## Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
Right.

## What?
The engines are fixed.

## So does anybody have any suggestions?
We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship. That would kill it.

## Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on?
Meet us on the bridge. Be careful -- it's huge now.

## Where did it come from?
He's the only one that knows that.

## How does he breathe?
Blood's thoroughly oxygenated.

## Isn't there some way we can get it off him?
It's a crude symbolic language -- looks primitive.

## That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him?
It wouldn't come.

## Hey now, what is this?
Ask him.

## What do you mean?
How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid? It's dead.

## How's Broussard?
He's running a fever.

## Still unconscious?
Yes.

## Can you do anything for him?
The machine will bring his temperature down. His vital functions are strong.

## How do we locate the creature?
Maybe we don't have to. It's trapped in there. We could just leave it in there all the way back to Irth.

## Got a better idea?
We'd better seal off the lower maintenance level; at least trap it there.

## I don't buy that. There's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers.
Does anybody know what happened?

## How?
It's time for drastic remedies.

## Should we go outside and bring him in?
I've completely lost their signal.

## Can you get them back?
I'm trying.

## What? What was that?
The computer just translated the goddamn message. It's not an S.O.S. It was a warning.

## What do you mean, no?
We're not going anywhere.

## What's happening up here?
I think it's fizzled out.

## Hey! what about the film?
That must have been when he got it.

## You mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him?
It was horrible -- horrible. Like a chicken.

## Recognizable! In that?
In symbolic form... very stylized... but if you stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with.

## Well... I suppose that star-shaped thing could be the parasite that got on Broussard. Is that what you mean?
And right next to it, that oval design with the markings -- it's a dead ringer for the spore casings.

## Blow the ship up?
And the creature with it. We can make it back to Irth in the lifeboat.

## Just keep your finger off the button till she's way away from the ship, that's all.
Isn't \"bait\" the word you used?

## Is it armed?
If you press the button right now, it will blow the whole nose of the ship off.

## Sandy, you want to give us some vision?
Feast your eyes.

## Computer, what's the frequency of the transmission?
I've got it. It's coming from ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds, declination -39 degrees 2 seconds.

## Well, we can't go anywhere in this darkness. How long till dawn?
Well... this rock rotates every two hours. The sun should be coming up in about 20 minutes.

## Just settle down. Sandy, you get any response yet?
Sorry. Nothing but that same damn transmission, every 32 seconds. I've tried every frequency on the spectrum.

## All right. Now just remember, keep away from those weapons unless I say otherwise. Martin, do you read me?
That way.

## What's wrong?
My signal's fading.

## How far?
We should be almost on top of it. I just can't quite...

## Doesn't seem much doubt about it, does there?
That creature sure must have considered it important... using his last strength to draw it...

## What'd he say?
No, it's coming.

## It won't come -- it's stuck.
Can you see anything?

## Let's let the machine work on him.
What is it?

## It's stopped?
Yes, thank heaven.

## Is it still dripping?
It appears to have healed itself.

## How?
Room by room, corridor by corridor.

## And what do we do when we find it?
We'll have to trap it somehow. If we had a really strong piece of net, we could bag it.

## That's the one about the albatross, right?
We came out there, we'll go back. A long time by the clock, but a short time to us.

## Are they close?
They're on the next level up.

## All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door. Okay?
Okay.

## And you and I will bag it, and then we'll take it to the ventral air lock, got it?
Men have waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe. This is an opportunity which may never come again.

## These day and night cycles are totally disorienting. I feel like we've been here for days, but it's only been how long?
About four hours.

## Yeah?
They never made it off the planet. The parasites won.

## Couldn't the pyramid have been built here by space travellers?
First thing I'm going to do when we get back is eat some biological food.

## What's the matter, you don't like this stuff?
Tastes like something you'd feed a chicken to make it lay more eggs.

## Where are we?
Sandy, contact traffic control.

## Computer, you have signalled a priority three message. What is the message?
Oh my God.

## Engine room, what happened?
Yeah, okay.

## Sandy... how far are we from the source of the transmission?
10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon... and some trace elements.

## Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.

## Good! Moisture content?
Zero. Dry as a bone.

## Any microorganisms?
Not a one. It's dead.

## Anything else?
Yeah, rock particles. Dust.

## Found what?
It appears to be some sort of spacecraft. We're going to approach it.

## Martin?
I agree. This is the single most important discovery in history.

## Find anything we missed?
I don't even know what I'm looking for.

## Still worried?
Oh well... you know me.

## What would you say that was supposed to mean?
Well... it's obviously intentional... some kind of attempt at communication... maybe it's a symbol that means something to them...

## But why draw it on the wall?
This ship is full of cat hair.

## Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?
It's some kind of organism, it's attached itself to him. Let us in.

## What film?
Broussard had film in his datastick, didn't he? We can see what happened to him.

## Is that its mouth?
They seem native to the planet. It's got an atmosphere and a dense gravity. It's dead now, but once it must have been fertile.

## Now what?
I guess we open the door and net it.

## Now what?
What do you think? Now we go in.

## Are you crazy?
The man would need protection, obviously -- as well as some way to drive the thing before him.

## So the only question left is, who gets to crawl down the airshaft?
Let's be democratic.

## How did it get so big?
By eating our food supplies.

## What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing.

## Can you make out any pattern in all that?
Well... yes... there's a pattern... but it's meaningless to me.

## Can we get to him?
No, I had to seal off a whole section. We'd lose too much of our remaining air if we opened the connecting door.

## So what do we do? Do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat -- or do we flush it out now?
Now. If we can get it into the boat, we won't have to blow it up -- we can just eject it into space.

## Who gets the privilege?
All right, Martin, we'll be in touch with you on the communicator.

## What did it do to you?
Look...

## What can I do?
Kill me...

## Headache? Dehydration?
The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.

## Can I... um... have some water? Please?
Sure.

## What is it?
It's nothing, Doc. Just a... touch of indigestion... something.

## Better?
Yeah...

## Do you wanna head back and call it in?
Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.

## Is it dead?
No, it's still breathing. Kinda clammy though. Are you sure your stick's not broken.

## Looks like a spore. Fungus of some kind, maybe?
Bloody big if it is. Top's open.

## Good argument for gun-control. What are you going after, rhino?
We've got no option. We're gonna have to get it off.

## Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?
Okay, give me the numbers.

## What do you need?
Cassie, thank Christ! We're under attack.

## How many of them are there?
Too many.

## Where is she?
Comin' up the Central Reservoir.

## And?
Drains right into the Central Reservoir.

## Shit. When?
Yesterday. We got the Network feed from Gateway; it was the top story on 'Sixty Seconds'. Biggest market crash since twenty-four.

## I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock. Anything else you wanna ruin my day with?
No, but I got something that might interest you.

## Where're they headed?
We ran a trajectory simulation. If they carry on along that path, it's possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion.

## Can we move it to a different orbit in time?
The door's sealed from inside. Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts.

## What's our weapons situation?
Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off.

## Has anybody talked to them?
Not yet.

## How much air-time have I got?
About thirty minutes. Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.

## Ah, quit griping. Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
Hey! I was in shape before we started doing this.

## Listen to what?
That's what I mean. This is the quietest I've ever heard it. It's unnatural.

## Yeah?
Next time you have a thought like that? Keep it to yourself.

## Something spooking the rhinos?
I dunno.

## What?
Take a look at this.

## What?
Just got a reading...

## What? Are you nuts? Just the two of us?
I've seen this mother, De Vries. We can bag it, no problem.

## What the hell are you doing?
Hey, fair enough. If you won't come, I'll handle it myself.

## What?
I'll come with you.

## Still got him?
It's moving slow. About... eleven metres. On the left.

## What's wrong?
I'm picking up another signal.

## What? Where?
Just behind us, over to the right.

## Can't see a thing. Are you sure?
Yeah, I...

## How?
I dunno. Might be a glitch.

## Is it still moving?
No, he's stopped; he's totally still. Just take it nice and easy, babe. Nice and easy...

## What happened?
York just turned up outside. We're trying to get him into Infirmary.

## Where does that lead to?
Okay.

## That sounds promising. Can we operate the crane from here?
Which mean physically going outside.

## Is this the suit?
Uh-huh.

## How tight are these shafts?
Hey, Jan. See if you can get someone to check out the chopper.

## What's the problem?
She was running a little sluggish on the way back. Think the turbines might be playing up.

## And...?
And, nothing. They checked out just fine.

## Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?
Done it already. Nothing matches.

## Fort Powell. What do we tell 'em?
Just give them the facts. They can leap to their own conclusions.

## How many... how many people are missing?
They knocked out the external feeds.

## What? Why?
There's still time to back-out.

## Forget it. I wouldn't ask somebody to do something I wouldn't do myself. Where's the disk?
Thanks.

## I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while. Clear my head.
Right. Auto-shop, you all set?

## Didn't feel like whoopin' it up with the rest of us blue collars, huh?
I've got a lot of thinking to do. 'Sides, the room was getting too crowded for me.

## Not too much of the socializing type, then?
No, not really. More sort of the 'claustrophobic' type.

## How long you been out here for now, anyway? Three months?
Four.

## And before that?
Six month stint on Datus.

## What is this? 'Twenty Questions'?
Just curious. There's a lot of talk goes around.

## What is that?
Real man' drink.

## Any luck raising Ackland's party?
First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.

## We'? You wanna fly out there with me?
Sure. Do me good to stretch my legs.

## Do you think Ackland'll sit tight?
There'd have to be a helluva good reason for him not to.

## What do you mean?
Think I spoke too soon...

## They...they snapped my legs to fit... fit me in here. I don't...remember what happened next.
What?

## What can I do?
Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linson's Range. They're making their own way back tomorrow.

## How's it going?
Yeah, 'Good Evening' to you, too.

## What time's sundown?
Bout five minutes.

## Hello, there. Who are you?
Miss Harrington's resting, Mr. deWitt. She asked me to see who it is...

## How do you know my name?
It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.

## And what is your name?
Phoebe.

## Phoebe?
I call myself Phoebe.

## May I come in?
Certainly, Mr. deWitt...

## We all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns. If we don't blow them - who will?
Even so. One isolated pretty good performance by an understudy. It'll be forgotten tomorrow.

## I'm not enough for a paragraph.
I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy?

## San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco?
Yes. I do.

## And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?
Yes. The Shubert.

## Eddie what?
I'm about to go into the shower, I won't be able to hear you...

## Hungry?
Just some coffee.

## She mentioned, of course, that Margo expects to play the part?
Oddly enough - she didn't say a word about Margo. Just that she'll be happy to do what she can to see that I play the part.

## Just like that, eh?
Just like that.

## Aren't you?
Frankly - yes.

## All paved with diamonds and gold?
You know me better than that.

## Paved with what, then?
Stars.

## What time?
Almost four.

## Why not?
The mark of a true killer. Sleep tight, rest easy - and come out fighting...

## Why'd call me a killer?
Did I say killer? I meant champion. I get my boxing terms mixed.

## Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd had a terrific row but Lloyd insisted... well. Can I fix you a drink?
Also with the reluctant compliments of Max Fabian.

## We're?
Lloyd and I.

## What else?
So that's it. Lloyd. Still just the Theater, after all...

## I see. And when was this unholy alliance joined?
We decided the night before last, before we came up here...

## Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?
I don't know what I take you for anything...

## What have you got to do with it?
Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me.

## No-no-no...
What of it?

## And you realize - you agree how completely you belong to me?
Yes, Addison.

## Why not?
Because I don't want to.

## It's the same thing, isn't it?
Exactly. Here. Take it to the party instead of me.

## Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
Because that is what they are. Go make him happy.

## Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what?
You next move, it seems to me, should be toward television.

## Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television?
That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions.

## What makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair?
This answer satisfies me a hundred percent.

## You were there? At the play - last night?
A happy coincidence.

## From the smartness of your dress, I take it your luncheon companion is a lady?
Margo.

## Margo? Lunching in public?
It's new Margo. But she's just as late as the old one.

## Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support - moral or otherwise.
I distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list. What are you doing here?

## The ladies' - shall we say - lounge?
Being violently ill to her tummy.

## Didn't you know?
Of course I knew.

## How... how was Miss Caswell?
Frankly, I don't remember.

## Was she that bad?
I take it she read well.

## Where?
Right here. A minute ago.

## We know you, we've seen you before like this. Is it over - or just beginning?
I guess at this point I'm what the French call 'de trop'...

## When? When are you going to do it?
Tomorrow we meet at City Hall at ten- - and you're going to be on time.

## Nothing?
Everything... everything's so funny...

## Real diamonds in a wig. The world we live in...
Is it sabotage, does my career mean nothing to you? Have you no human consideration?

## Where's my coat?
I told her. I sounded off.

## you're a setup for some gorgeous wide-eyed young babe.
Huh?

## And cut that out right now.
How childish are you going to get before you quit it?

## Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
That I am...

## in a tin can, cellophane or wrapped in a Navajo blanket, I want you home...
When - when are you coming back?

## You in a hurry?
A big hurry, be quick about it - so good night, darling, and sleep tight...

## Sing it?
Sure! Like the Western Union boys used to do...

## And who remembered it? Who was there on the dot, at twelve midnight...?
Happy birthday, darling...

## Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?
It's no secret, I know all about the party - Eve wrote me...

## She did...?
Yeah... I will.

## How is Eve? Okay?
Okay.

## You're in a beehive, pal, didn't you know? We're all busy little bees, full of stings, making honey day and night- - aren't we, honey?
I had no idea you were even here.

## Cut! Print it! What happens in the next reel? Do I get dragged off screaming to the snake pit?
Thank you.

## Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?
You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural.

## Then without feeling, your guests were also wondering whether the music couldn't be a shade more on the - shall we say, happier side?
If my guests do not like it here, I suggest they accompany you to the nursery where I'm sure you will all feel more at home.

## What's all over?
The audition.

## Who?
The kid. Junior.

## You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
I'm trying terribly hard.

## Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me?
It's not nonsense.

## But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me? Isn't that enough?
I wish it were.

## Then what would be enough? If we were married?
I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.

## Bill... ... where are you going? To find Eve?
That suddenly makes the whole thing believable.

## What would you like? Texas?
You've got it backwards. Even for Wilkes-Barre.

## You know what I'm going to be?
A cowboy.

## Hello, what's your name?
Eve. Eve Harrington.

## Why?
I just wondered.

## Just wondered what?
Why.

## Why what?
Why you have to go out there.

## Is it the money?
Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.

## I think we'd like very much. Sure you won't mind?
Of course not.

## Are you proud of me, Bill?
I'll admit I was worried when Max called. I had my doubts.

## Is that what you want me to be?
I'm talking about you. And what you want.

## What have I got to do with it?
Everything.

## You're always after truth - on the stage. What about off?
I'm for it.

## I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
You hear all kinds of things.

## The bed looks like a dead animal act. Which one is sables?
But she just got here...

## What did you expect - live sables?
A diamond collar, gold sleeves - you know, picture people...

## Imagine. All this admiration in just one room.
The same size?

## Kill the people. Got your key?
I haven't got a union. I'm slave labor.

## Do you want an argument or an answer?
An answer.

## Why not?
Now you want an argument.

## She thinks only for me... ... doesn't she?
Well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...

## You're not being funny, I could get actors for less. What about the food?
The caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres- Voila.

## Late for what?
Don't be dense. The party.

## Who are you?
Miss Harrington...

## What are you doing here?
You were just looking around...

## What for?
You probably won't believe me.

## What report? To whom?
I've heard of them.

## Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?
Lots of actresses come from Brooklyn. Barbara Stanwyck, Susan Hayward - of course, they're just movie stars.

## How'd you get all the way up here from Brooklyn?
Subway.

## How long does it take?
With changing and everything, a little over an hour.

## To speak to just a playwright's wife? I'm the lowest form of celebrity...
Why should you think I wouldn't be?

## You're Margo Channing's best friend. You and your husband are always with her - and Mr. Sampson... what's he like?
Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director.

## He'll agree with you. Tell me, what do you between the time Margo goes in and comes out? Just huddle in that doorway and wait?
Oh, no. I see the play.

## You look just fine... ... by the way. What's your name?
Eve. Eve Harrington.

## Eve... why don't you start at the beginning?
It couldn't possibly interest you.

## You're not going, are you?
I think I'd better. It's been - well, I can hardly find the words to say how it's been...

## Now who's show up at this hour? It's time people went home - hold that coat up... ... whose is it?
Some Hollywood movie star, her plane got in late.

## Karen... ... isn't it awful, I'm about to ask you for another favor - after all you've already done.
Tell me, Eve - how are things with you? Happy?

## Nobody's done so much, Eve, you've got to stop thinking of yourself as one of the Hundred Neediest Cases... what is it?
... you want to be Margo's new understudy.

## Do you think Miss Channing would approve?
I think she would cheer.

## Then - would you talk to Mr. Fabian about it?
Of course.

## You won't forget it?
I won't forget.

## I seem to be forever thanking you for something, don't I?
You mustn't mind Margo too much, even if I do...

## Karen... ... you won't forget, will you? What we talked about before?
No, Eve, I won't forget...

## May I have your coat?
No! I don't expect you to believe anything. Except that the responsibility is mine. And the disgrace.

## If you told him so, he'd give me the part. He said he would.
Tell me. How did your lunch turn out - with the man from Hollywood?

## After all you've said... don't you know the part was written for Margo?
It could have been - fifteen years ago. It's my part now.

## Every performance? Then - am I safe in assuming you like it?
I'd like anything Miss Channing played...

## How'd hear about it?
There was an item in the Times. i like the title. 'Footsteps on the Ceiling'.

## Did you see it here in New York?
No, don't go...

## You haven't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating...
What - again?

## Well, you've done so much... what's new?
The curtains. I made them myself.

## No trouble at all.
They are lovely. Aren't they lovely, Birdie?

## Well - what do you think of my elegant new suit?
Very becoming. It looks better on you than it did on me.

## I can imagine... you know, all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there - are you sure you won't want it yourself?
Quite sure. I find it just a bit too - too \"Seventeenish\" for me...

## That's my job. See you at tea time...
Oh, come now, as though you were an old lady... I'm on my way. Is there anything more you've thought of-?

## Of course.
Eve... ... by any chance, did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?

## The hors d'oeuvres are here. Is there anything else I can do?
Thank you, Eve. I'd like a Martini - very dry.

## Really, Eve? Why?
Well, if you'd been here to begin with, I wouldn't have dared to read at all...

## Ain't it the truth?
Yes, it is! You're talented, famous, wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain...

## You've what?
She's just outside the door.

## Dear Birdie. Won't you sit down, Miss Worthington?
Harrington.

## I'm so sorry... Harrington. Won't you sit down?
Would you like a drink? It's right beside you...

## How much time have we?
Roughly ten minutes.

## How far to the station?
Three or four miles...

## Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...

## Do you want it on?
It doesn't matter.

## What about Bill?
He's in love with you.

## Why should he - and why should you?
Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.

## I don't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn't?
Silly, isn't it? You'd think they'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm...

## Well... all right.
About what?

## With tears?
With tears.

## How was the concert?
Loud.

## Coming?
In a minute...

## Margo hasn't done badly by it.
Lloyd, what happened...?

## What is?
We're driving out to the country tomorrow night. Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I...

## Just a little skid, that's all. This road's like glass.
What time is it?

## But it can't be! We can't be out of gas! I filled it myself yesterday! Wasn't it full when you drove to Brewster this morning?
Eve.

## Eve?
She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...

## Maybe get some younger actress for the part? Someone who'd look the part as well as play it?
You've got to admit it would be a novelty.

## Such as?
You - for one. I told her you were set on Margo playing the part - and I certainly wouldn't make a change without your approval.

## What are you going to wear?
After all, maybe she just wants to apologize...

## well? What happened?
Nothing much. She apologized.

## You mean - all this time - she'd done nothing but apologize? What'd you say?
Not much.

## What's so funny?
Nothing...

## I doubt very much that you'd like her in 'The Hairy Ape'.
Who is it? What's it all about?

## How about calling it a night?
And you pose as a playwright. A situation pregnant with possibilities - and all you can think of is everybody to go to sleep...

## What is he talking about?
There you are, both of you. Max, Karen has decided it's time to go.

## Where is she?
Up in the room.

## Who's left out there?
Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood.

## You disapprove of me when I'm like this, don't you?
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.

## How's the new one coming?
The play? All right, I guess...

## \"Cora.\" She's - still a girl of twenty?
Twentyish. It isn't important.

## How do you mean?
Don't be evasive.

## What do you mean?
That's beside the point.

## What's your being married got to do with it?
Hello..

## We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time, to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills...
Call, what call?

## I placed...?
I ain't gonna die. Not with a hit.

## Margo. You by any chance got bicarbonate of soda in the house?
Poor Max. Heartburn? It's that Miss Caswell. I don't know why she doesn't give Addison heartburn.

## Miss Caswell? What?
An audition for the part we're replacing. What's-her-name, your sister...

## When's the audition?
A couple of weeks.

## Would you?
Anything to help you out, Max.

## You get quick action, don't you?
Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...

## What is it about my writing that's so rotten?
Mainly it has to do with your choice of words.

## Yeah?
Fuck you, Carl.

## Forget it, the main thing-- --did you call me a failure?
I was sure trying.

## Hey?
Hmm.

## What do you think he meant, this particular incident? Were there others? How would we find out? You know anyone important?
It makes sense; Hunt worked for the C.I.A. and the White House was paranoid about Teddy Kennedy.

## That was fun. What now?
And?--And?--

## Who's first?
Alphabetically, on the CREEP phone list, Miss Helen Abbott of South George Street.

## Facts or theory?
Anything you've got.

## Republican?
Sure.

## When?
68.

## Did he just say what I think he said?
You voted for him.

## How do you want to handle Sloan?
You mean, who's going to play the mean M.P. and who's going to be the nice one? Whichever.

## Think Sloan's back? What's wrong?
Nothing--I just found out that Jeb Magruder from CREEP is a bigger bike freak than I am. I never like it when the other guy's human...

## --Haldeman I know, who else?
You asking would I have been one of the President's men? I would have been.

## You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal. God knows it worked.

## Who?
Haldeman.

## What if I went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me?
Well, we are trying to ruin his life.

## What's the matter?
Only everything...

## So I guess you could say that we screwed up, but we weren't wrong.
You overslept?

## --what time is it?
11,30.

## Morning or night?
Night.

## Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow?
I'm on deadline.

## You want Barker's phone stuff or his money stuff?
Whatever.

## I never could figure just who this Dahlberg was. Think it might be anything?
Sure. Him I liked, he was a very nice person. Secretive too, traveled all over, but a decent man.

## I told you, he had to go out on a case.
Any idea what he did?

## Could you reach Mr. Dardis by car radio?
He is not in the car. Sorry.

## Mr. Dardis does call in every so often?
That's right.

## Mind if I try?
According to what we've been able to verify, you've been busy.

## Listen--we know you're involved in this--we're going to get the story, why not help?
They never told me anything except my own role--I had to find out the rest in the papers.

## By \"they\" you mean...?
By \"they\" you mean the White House, don't you? Your buddy from USC, Dwight Chapin-- he works for the White House.

## Do you feel much about the things you did?
I didn't do anything wrong.

## Chapin did contact you then?
Sure--off the record.

## On the orders of Haldeman?
Can't help you.

## --so?
I think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Miami.

## What's a real denial?
If they ever start calling us goddamn liars-- --it's time to start circling the wagons.

## --if he did it or just said he did it, God knows.
I thought you guys were supposed to be working on this story-- --you think I like being aced out?

## --what about you?--
--Bernstein, are you sure on this story?

## Oh, they're here. I'm keeping much better records now, Hannah. See?
Hey... very tense.

## You're two months behind--you got enough to cover?
I think.

## If you don't like it down there, why don't you quit?
I don't know what they'd do to me.

## All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff?
I'm relaxed--light your cigarette.

## Which people?
The ones who could disburse the money.

## Who were they?
There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.

## It's awfully hot-- --and you haven't finished telling me about the money--
Sloan knew which five, didn't he?

## Gordon Liddy, you mean?
Think Sloan's being set up as a fall guy for John Mitchell? Sometimes it looks that way.

## Why couldn't you have just dialed me from the office, Irwin?
Cause I'm not calling out from the phone company anymore-- --I think the place is bugged.

## What do you want to know?
No games, Irwin; give.

## My big civil rights buddy-- --boy, if John Mitchell was after your phone records, would you be screaming. What're you onto?
Something maybe big.

## And that makes anything you do OK, is that it?
Just tell me about the goddamn article.

## Who by?
A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis.

## --they're worse. That's why I quit.
Irwin? I really feel bad, doing something like this--you know that, don't you?

## Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.

## Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
We were never told flat out \"Don't talk.\" But the message was clear.

## To cover up?
Well, they sure didn't ask us to come forward and tell the truth.

## But they both worked at the White House?
I will not talk about the other two.

## What happens when the baby comes?
I really can't talk now--

## Then it's our asses, isn't it?
My non-denial denial.

## You saying the Democrats bugged themselves?
I was told by this guy at the White House that Hunt was investigating Teddy Kennedy.

## You asking me to disclose my source?
Just tell me his title.

## --I saw him. He verifies.
Is he on the level of Assistant to the President or not?

## We can't talk inside either?
Electronic surveillance.

## Anything else from Mr. Throat?
Mr. Caddy? My name's Bob Woodward, I'm from the Post and I wanted to ask about how you happened to come on this case--

## Did you know to come because one of the other men involved in the break- in called you?
There is no reason to assume other people were involved.

## Are you implying you don't believe me?
I have nothing more to say.

## She's an awfully good reporter--I can't remember her getting too much wrong before, can you?
That's a bullshit question, that's a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas.

## --I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment.
Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing, where did your talk with Berger happen?

## ...you're definitely doing a story...?
Yes, sir.

## I see. And how do you think it reached Miami?
That checks out with our finding, thank you, Mr. Dahlberg.

## I saw the flag signal--what's up?
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.

## Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in. You come up with anything?
Follow the money. Always follow the money.

## To where?
Go on.

## --melodramatic? Things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge City.
You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?

## What's the whole thing about--do you know?
What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.

## My turn to keep you waiting. What's the topic for tonight?
Ratfucking.

## Who?--be specific. How high up?
You'll have to find that out, won't you.

## Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?
They know, but they focused on the burglary--if it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it.

## Why didn't they?--who told them not to?
Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you? Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.

## Why did they do all this for Chrissakes?--what were they after?
Total manipulation. I suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines.

## Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
I was being cautious. You can safely say more then fifty...

## Hello, I'm Bob Woodward of the Washing Post and... Mullen and Company Public Relations? Could you tell me when you expect Mr. Hunt? He is?
Howard Hunt here.

## And what is your occupation, Mr. McCord?
Security consultant.

## Where?
Government. Recently retired.

## Where in government?
...Central... Intelligence... Agency...

## Where?
The C.I.A.

## Are you sure?
No.

## When will you be, do you think?-- when are we going to know it all?
It may never come out.

## And the underground garage one. Would I know him?
I couldn't say.

## Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse?
Two o'clock, work the phones 'til you go.

## As a rough rule of thumb, as far as I can throw Bronco Nagurski, that's how much I trust John Mitchell...
You can't believe that.

## I can't sell hints to Simons-- --you called everyone you know? Call someone you don't know.
What'd you get on W.House?

## Who's Colson, Harry?
The most powerful man in America is President Nixon, probably you've heard his name.

## So?
One Senator just gave a speech slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes.

## He just did.
You think she wants us to ease up on the story?

## The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?
No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.

## And as treasurer, you could release those funds?
When so ordered.

## Haldeman. Right?
I won't talk about the other two.

## One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?
Go on.

## A boy or a girl?
A girl. Melissa.

## No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.
--look, when the Watergate grand jury questioned you, did you name names?

## LADY The what to what?
You work there, Miss Abbott.

## What the hell was that?
Sorry.

## Okay then. The rest of you okay with that?
Good work, Ostreicher.

## Great evening, isn't it?
Sure.

## Suck me...beautiful?
Uh...you know, my friends call me Nova -- as in Casanova.

## Like what?
Alright, well...you've got to tone it down. You don't need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic.

## Finch! Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
I thought a fashionably late entrance would enhance my appearance. When I got here, the Bacchanalia was over and the nymphs had left.

## You're just gonna sit there and drink your coffee?
Mochaccino. Actually, in the spirit of the pact, I do need to ask for your cooperation in one small matter.

## When was the last time you looked at the facilities here?
Ah, Stifler's mom! Thank you for letting us have a great party.

## I'm so happy for you. Takes the edge off, doesn't it? And where might your date be?
Oh no, no date. Bathroom incident.

## ...Nevermind. You have anything to drink?
I believe the kegs are upstairs.

## Single malt?
Aged eighteen years. Why don't you get the glasses. Behind the bar.

## Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
Yep.

## Of course, Finch. What?
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.

## What are we gonna hear?
You'll see. Gotta go. Sixteen minute round trip.

## What do you suppose they're saying?
No idea.

## So Oz, you almost made it, huh?
Not bad, Chris.

## Really? Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.

## Okay. I mean, I agree, but...aren't you supposed to be out, like, trying to decapitate someone with your lacrosse stick or something?
I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you. I was interested.

## You can call me Oz.
Hey, what're you doing here?

## Do I have to?
You can call me Ostreicher.

## What's your middle name?
Forget it.

## You don't like it?
No, I like the car. By the way, though, about prom? That was like a bad idea. Sorry I invited you.

## Why are you doing this?
Because I want to.

## How did you know I was here?
Stifler told me.

## You talked to Stifler?
Well...I needed to find you. We are gonna have to practice that song.

## Well, State's got a good business school. And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team. Green peppers?
Yeah. So wow, you've got it figured out.

## I know. Salt and pepper?
Sure.

## So we're gonna be close next year?
You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.

## What's that?
It's gonna sound really bad, but I want you to know.

## Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex. So did you do the physics write-up?
Please.

## Of course he does. What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period?
I think I've had one.

## Well that's a no. No wonder you're not psyched about sex. You've never even had one manually?
...I've never tried it.

## Jessica, can you drive me home?
Sure.

## You mean...and orgasm?
You got it, stud.

## Do you?
Of course.

## Do you love her?
I -- I don't know, you can't ask me that.

## Did you guys hook up or something?
Are you kidding? No.

## Duh. Of course. Naturally, I embellished a little bit. Hey, did you hear that Finch had sex with an older woman?
Oooh, yeah. Oh, baby, you're so good.

## There's our man.
You think she was serious?

## Finch, you got the Latin homework?
Unlisted age, plus \"youthful mind,\" equals old.

## You can crash at Stifler's?
It's all good. Breath check.

## So, does my hair look better -- like this, or... like this?
What about you? You're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base.

## You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base?
Sorry, I thought you were dead.

## Like a bet?
No, a pact. No money involved. This is more important than any bet. Now here's the deal, We all get laid before we graduate.

## Hey, where's Finch?
Went home to shit.

## I don't get it. How does a guy like that get this sudden reputation?
You can send me the address too.

## Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?
I'll save you a seat.

## But, but -- what would I do?
Anything! Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.

## Come on, Jim. Where are you?
Please, God. Let this be it.

## How do you know that?
She's already on a plane back home.

## No, no that's fine. So you doing okay?
Yeah.

## Can I come in?
Yeah, sure.

## You're not...busy?
Yes dad.

## Dad, please stop. Please. I'm sure I know what you're talking about.
Jim?

## Hold on. You have no idea why I'm angry?
Michelle.

## Really? You seriously want to go with me?
Yes. Seriously.

## You know, at band camp? We have dances like this. Only they're way funner. Don't you think prom is just highly overrated?
Highly, highly overrated.

## A hot cartoon.
So, the end of the story is...you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds?

## No -- Kevin, you?
Ooh, here's an easy one, \"Attractive SWF, fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion.\" Okay...\"Attractive\"...ugly.

## This was remade? Into what?
Bli-hinded by the light -- cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night, blinded...

## Nadia does, that Czechoslovakian chick, she might be there tonight. Now, do you think she'd prefer -- Cool Hip Jim... or Laid Back Jim?
Shortstop. 'Course, you don't make it to third, and you're out.

## So let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like?
Feels like warm apple pie, dude.

## Apple pie... McDonald's or homemade?
Hey, you did better than I did, Nova.

## Hey guys, you came to watch me in action?
Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.

## You can do that?
Oh -- no way. I can't do that to her.

## You've still got a chance with Nadia, right?
No. Her sponsors here saw the thing on the net. I don't think they liked it.

## After getting laid?
After high school.

## What's up, fellas?
Hey Sherman. Scopin' the babes.

## Did you see that Central chick? Brunette?
You did it.

## Me?
Yes. No. Yes.

## Well, I do have ballet practice. Perhaps I can come by your house afterwards. I can change clothes at your place?
I suppose that would be okay.

## So you need to change, right?
Do you mind? This fabric is so uncomfortable.

## Strip?
Yes, slowly.

## For me?
Uh...

## Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.

## Oh, Kev.
You think so?

## Yeah, it's such a perfect evening. Isn't this how you've always pictured it?
Let me know.

## Indeed I did. But, our relationship. It's progressed a lot. It's time for us to...express ourselves in new ways.
How?

## Like how?
Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.

## Kevin? Do you not love me?
No, I don't not love you. I like, I know that we've definitely got something between us. Something good. Something special.

## I know, Vick. I'm just not ready yet, okay?
Okay.

## Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
It's like a six or seven hour drive. That's easy, I don't mind driving.

## Yeah, are you?
Yeah.

## Yeah. Are you sure?
Yeah.

## Okay. Did you bring a condom?
Yeah, right here.

## I don't know. How do you?
Like, normal style. The...missionary position.

## Yeah Vick?
I want to hear you say it.

## You called me to ask me how to get laid?
What was I gonna do, call dad? I don't even know his number.

## What? Not the Bible?
Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.

## Does it tell me how to get laid?
You know what, nevermind. You're not ready.

## Ready for what?
Whoop, you're fading out. Good luck at that party.

## Say that again, Kevin?
Uh...I thought you might know a trick or something. To make her, you know...

## Uh -- forget that. Look, is that all you're interested in? Ways to get your girlfriend into bed?
That's good, that's what I needed to hear. Now you qualify.

## Qualify for what?
You've just inherited The Bible.

## What's that?
Once, in church, dude.

## How the hell do you know all these random songs?
It's early Springsteen, dude, this is classic. This was before the cheesy remake.

## Feeling better, Oz?
I'm such a loser.

## No shit, I'm never gonna get laid. How the hell am I gonna become this Mr. Sensitive Man?
Dude, it's not like I haven't been trying to get laid.

## So does your tongue cramp up?
Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.

## What reputation?
Observe.

## ...Guess what?
I don't care.

## He didn't?
I guess we'll call you two-ply.

## Wow. You two really have something going, don't you?
Depends if my date wants to stop by.

## That junior chick?
She works part-time at my dad's store.

## What the fuck are you doing here?
This place is an untapped resource. Check it out, dude, these vocal jazz girls are hot.

## You dipshit, you're expecting to score with some goody-goody choir-girl priss?
Dude, watch me work. They go for sensitive studs like me.

## I'll bet you do, you little horndog, she's givin' you fuckin' stiffies, right?
Oh my fucking God. You're gay.

## Really?
Uh huh.

## Doing what?
You know. If we hook up, tomorrow I'll just be some girl you go telling all your friends about.

## Oh give me a break! He could use pills back in America! Why not get a little culture?
Let's face it. It's a, how do you say... mother-fucker. But we're all in it together. That's why we're trying to help you.

## Would you shut up?
Tell you what, we'll jump together.

## Wow. You know Kung Fu or something?
Yeah. Apparently.

## Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?
A-duh... You're a werewolf. And we, as your victims, have to walk the earth until your curse is lifted.

## Uh huh... And, supposing I believed that, what could I do about it?
Look, I didn't mean to hurt anybody... God, I didn't mean to... to...

## Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.

## Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.

## What?
If you leave it for more than a few minutes it locks up. Now I must reboot and type a dozen fucking passwords. He was security crazy.

## Medusa... What's this? some kind of club?
It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh...

## Like an underground club?
Yes. It's a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on.

## And who's Claude?
Professor Claude Rousel. The one your uncle was working with. He teaches cultural history.

## What good can you do? Why are you being so fucking stupid?
Thank God! What a relief! I thought... After you disappeared... I couldn't find you... I thought all sorts of horrible things...

## What happened? Did you cut yourself?
Um... sort of... Maybe... It's all kind of blurry. We met at the club, then... Damn, that was some weird shit.

## Fan-fucking-tastic?
Come on Serafine. Let's go out. Show me the real Paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with German tourists.

## What about your glasses?
It's okay. I can see fine.

## So tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study English with?
Like I should talk. Monsieur foot-in- the-mouth. I'm really sorry about that whole Woody Allen thing...

## Fixing your makeup with a phone, huh? Who the fuck are you calling?
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.

## Are you okay?
No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...

## Where did you go last night? What did you do?
I don't... I... I can't remember...

## What?! He told you? When?
You two faced bastard. I knew you were full of shit.

## A cure?
Andy... I should never have let you go underground. I'm sorry...

## What makes you so sure this will work?
I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this.

## Are you crazy!?
Before Hemingway, there was Starsky and Hutch.

## What the fuck!? You too!?
I... I didn't think you would... I'm sorry... I believed that son-of-a- bitch...

## Andy?... What? What is it? Andy... are you okay?
Here! Come on! Do it! Go ahead.

## We can't stop him. Not now. Handcuffed, with no kind of weapons. Please Andy...
What...?

## Where?
Somewhere where there are no police, and plenty to eat.

## What?
It's making me hungry.

## It bit me! My leg! Jesus, it's down there, shoot it! Shoot it for Christ's sakes!
What does it say?

## You on drugs? Huh?
No... I...

## Where's the ADM? Where did your uncle put it?
And you call me a moron...

## Ha. Some wonder drug...
If you know about the church, why ask such stupid questions?

## Looks like he lied to you too.
Why isn't it doing anything!?

## Merde... Wait here. When I return you tell me about last night, huh?
But... I don't remember anything, I swear...

## What about me?
My men think you died and floated away in the Seine. If I wanted to, I could let them believe that. But that would be illegal...

## Yeah well, that's like really groovy and everything, but who hacked my uncle's legs off?
Andy...

## Yeah?
You didn't know? But then why did you... well, don't worry. It's relatively mild.

## Why the fuck would I do that?
Yeah, well what if it's the Weekly World News...

## Claude.
Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?

## Andrew Mc-dair-mo?
That's McDermott, but yeah.

## Right. Listen, my uncle, it's not serious is it? Did he eat some bad snails? Slip on the bidet? What?
Jesus...

## How well did, er, do you know him?
No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.

## Yeah. I guess so. Did he say anything? Before the coma?
Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.

## I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
Not that I know.

## Good man. Now can I have my arms back?
Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...

## What've you got?
Just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. I wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.

## What did she say?
Something about a monster, underground, in the catacombs under Place Denfert.

## Well?
Okay. So maybe you were right.

## I was showing Sonya something ...
You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?

## What were you showing her?
How to read.

## Oh, Grandmama, why do you have to go back to Paris?
No. I'm running to.

## Where is your home, Anya?
I'm not sure but look...

## I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them! Do you know Dmitri?
I'm fine.

## Who's Sophie?
We're just going to refresh your memory...

## Did I tell you that?
I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution...

## Why do you want to go to Paris?
I have my reasons.

## Do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.

## Yeah ... well, yours. You still don't believe that you're the Princess, do you?
I'm sorry.

## Nervous?
Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana....

## Who are you, child?
I don't know! I don't want to hurt you...

## Do you remember this?
PAR AWAY, LONG AGO GLOWING DEEP AS AN EMBER

## Don't you, child?
Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...

## Dmitri didn't want the money?
No, he just wanted to know you were happy.

## Why does everyone have to act that way?
I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.

## What?
Oh my God! Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...

## No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached. Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
And what do you want, my little rat-with-wings?

## Why would I ever be angry with you, little friend?
Evil, powerful beings - I have their power only if I contain them, control them. If they should all be released at once... well ...

## We will. We have to. Come on, Vlad - she's out there.
Bartok ... have you ever been to Paris?

## It's her.
What was that?

## Hurry up with those papers.
He's her?

## Would you have leaned over Rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster?
Wake up, young lady, that's our train.

## What do we do now?
If I used the word \"bleak\" I would be optimistic.

## The \"Odessa Dunk\"?
It worked in Odessa...

## Are you feeling all right?
Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl ... and then you lose her.

## What do you mean?
But this invitation came from the Empress herself! It's the social event of the decade! You can't turn it down!

## I should go
Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.

## Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana?
Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.

## Hey, you on television?
No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.

## What's your name?
You don't want my autograph.

## Who's on television?
This guy, on the Johnny Carson show.

## You're a thinking person. How can you choose this lifestyle?
What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city! You-you read \"Death in Venice\".

## Who are you?
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.

## What do you mean, next?
Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.

## Why not?
No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't... I don't wanna go on after that comedian.

## Do you feel all right?
Allison.

## Yeah? Allison what?
Portchnik.

## Yeah, Earl Warren?
Hey... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.

## Lyndon Johnson?
L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician. You know the ethics those guys have? It's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester.

## Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
Tsch.

## The FBI, and the CIA, and J. Edgar Hoover and oil companies and the Pentagon and the men's-room attendant at the White House?
I-I-I-I would leave out the men's- room attendant.

## Okay. Please, I have a headache, all right?
Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.

## Look, while we're talking we could be inside, you know that?
Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.

## Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie? So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.

## How can you possibly oversleep?
The alarm clock.

## I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?

## Okay, I'm very sorry. My sexual problem! Okay, my sexual problem! Huh?
Boy, those guys in the French Resistance were really brave, you know? Got to listen to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.

## What-what-what-what's the matter?
I-you know, I don't wanna.

## Gimme! Gimme! Let me do it! What- what's he think we're gonna do, take him to the movies?
Oh, God! Here yuh go! Oh, good, now he'll think- Aaaah! Okay.

## Well, then, w-who was?
Oh, well, let's see, there was Dennis, from Chippewa Falls High School.

## Oh, why-uh... y-y-you gotta car?
No, um... I was gonna take a cab.

## Yeah.
I don't... I don't... Geez, I don't know, I've... I wa- This... yeah, I got this VW out there... What a jerk, yeah. Would you like a lift?

## So, how long do you know Janet? Where do you know her from?
Oh, I'm in her acting class.

## I, uh... well, you're not from New York, right?
No, Chippewa Falls.

## Right! Where?
Wisconsin.

## Yeah... so, listen-you drive?
Do I drive? Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving.

## Oh, you do?
Yeah. I got, uh, I got a license but I have too much hostility.

## You keep it nice. Can I ask you, is this-is this a sandwich?
Huh? Oh, yeah.

## You want your tennis stuff?
Huh? Oh... yeah.

## Who? Grammy? Grammy Hall?
Yeah, my grammy.

## You're jo- Whatta yuh kid- What did you do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting?
Jesus, my-my grammy... n-never gave gifts, you know. She-she was too busy getting raped by Cossacks.

## You sure?
No, I got time.

## Oh, you see an analyst?
Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.

## Fifteen years?
Yeah, uh, I'm gonna give him one more year and then I'm goin' to Lourdes.

## Fifteen-aw, come on, you're... yeah, really?
Sylvia Plath.

## Neat?
Neat, yeah.

## Duane?
Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.

## Well, who's Sadie?
Uh, narcolepsy.

## Well, didn't you take, uh... uh, a shower at the club?
Me? No, no, no, 'cause I never shower in a public place.

## Why not?
Cause I don't like to get naked in front of another man, you know-it's, uh...

## Fifteen years, huh?
Fifteen years, yeah.

## So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?
Yeah, yeah, I sorta dabble around, you know.

## You know, I gotta get there and begin whining soon... otherwise I- Hey... well, are you busy Friday night?
Me? Oh, uh. No.

## I know.
Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?

## Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too.
Gee, boy, what do you have? You have plague?

## No, I'm not gonna letcha. You have a great voice.
what I mean?

## Yeah?
It's terrific.

## What?
Gimme a kiss.

## Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna go home later, right?
Yeah.

## Okay?
Yeah.

## Oh. And your first wife was Allison?
My first... Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault. I was just... I was too crazy.

## H'm?
\"There goes another novel.\" Jesus, you were great.

## Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

## Yeah?
Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.

## Yeah?
big subject with me, yeah.

## Yeah?
M'hm.

## ...you know, they're- The-the horrible would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal cases, you know?
M'hm.

## Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?
Oh, yeah.

## Oh, yeah?
And there's the winner of the Truman Capote look-alike contest.

## Do I love you?
That's the key question.

## Well, I certainly... I think that's very- Yeah, yeah... yeah. Do you love me?
I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...

## Don't you think I do?
I dunno.

## Whatta you mean? You're not gonna give up your own apartment, are you?
Of course.

## Yeah, bu-bu-but why?
Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.

## How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
Mine.

## How is it any different?
That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.

## That place is four hundred dollars a month?
Yes, it is.

## Then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like I was dumb or something?
Cause adult education's a wonderful thing. You meet a lotta interesting professors. You know, it's stimulating.

## Well, okay. Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay?
Yeah, grass, right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday.

## Well, have you ever made love high?
It relaxes me.

## Well, what's the difference, anyway?
Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. You can sleep through it.

## What are you doing?
No, no, no, what... You can once, you can live without it once. Come on.

## Uh-uh-why?
I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.

## Really?
U-huh.

## Is it my imagination or are you just going through the motions?
Oh, you have my body.

## Were you always funny?
Hey, what is this-an interview? We're supposed to be making love.

## Are yuh?
Following is different. I was spying.

## Do you realize how paranoid you are?
It's his name.

## Oh, yeah? How'd it go?
Oh, it was... really weird. But she's a very nice woman.

## Yeah?
M'm.

## And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that?
Me? I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so... you know.

## Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
M'hm.

## Sinatra?
Yeah, and he's strangling me...

## She said, your name was Alvy Singer.
Yeah?

## Whatta you mean? Me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.

## Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
Oh, and God, Alvy, I did... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.

## She said, \"Will it change my wife.\" You heard that because you were there so I'm not crazy.
Tsch, what'd the doctor say?

## There's a spider in the bathroom.
Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?

## What?
There's a big black spider in the bathroom.

## That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.

## Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?
No.

## It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?
Alvy, you're a little hostile, you know that? Not only that, you look thin and tired.

## I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?

## Yeah, where is the spider?
It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.

## Is he in the bathroom?
Hey, don't squish it, and after it's dead, flush it down the toilet, okay? And flush it a couple o' times.

## Oh. What?
Very big spider.

## Yeah?
Two... Yeah. Lotta, lotta trouble. There's two of 'em.

## Honey, there's a spider in your bathroom the size of a Buick.
Two?

## Hey, what is this? You got black soap?
It's for my complexion.

## Whatta you mean, don't go? Whatta- whatta what's the matter? Whatta you expecting termites? What's the matter?
Oh, uh, I don't know. I miss you. Tsch.

## W-w-whatta you mean?
I mean was there another- I thought I heard a voice.

## Oh, no, no, I think we're both much too mature for something like that.
Yeah?

## Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?
You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.

## Here's a real present.
What is this? Is this a... Present? Are you kidding?

## What... huh?
Check it out.

## Thing?
yes, we had, uh...

## What's... you... well, what's the matter, You w-wanna go to that party?
I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people.

## All right, all right, you don't wanna go to the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do?
That day in Brooklyn was the last day I remember really having a great time.

## Alvy, come on, for your own experience. I mean, you wanna write, why not?
...I'm thrilled. As you know, uh... uh, on my agent's advice I sold out, and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.

## Nothing at all?
Yeah, this place is great.

## Don't you think his girl friend's beautiful?
Yeah, she's got a great-lookin' fa- A pat on the androgynous side. But it's...

## Whose \"Catcher in the Rye\" is this?
Well, let's see now... If it has my name on it, then I guess it's mine.

## God.
This \"Denial of Death\". You remember this?

## Remember that day?
Right. Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back. M'mmm.

## What?
We can always come back together again. Because there's no-there's no problem. 'Cause... Right.

## That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
So whatta you... You're not gonna come back to New York?

## You're mad, aren't you?
No. Yes, of course I'm mad, because you love me, I know that.

## Air miles, you know. I mean, you know what that does to my stomach?
If you must know, it's a hectic time for Tony. The Grammys are tonight.

## The what?
The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards.

## Alvy.
You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?

## Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
This is my room.

## Can I confess something?
Right. Tsch, well, I have to-I have t-o go now, Duane, because I-I'm due back on the planet earth.

## What'd I do?
You should be ashamed of yourself.

## Why are you so hostile?
Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television.

## No jokes-these are friends, okay?
Here you are. There's people out there.

## Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop?
Alvy, don't! You're using sex to express hostility.

## Bad?
Well, I'm-I'm gonna take another in a series of cold showers.

## You catch Dylan?
Me? No, no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.

## You have a raccoon?
Tsch, a few.

## Are you?
Yeah.

## It's unbelievably trans-plendid! I was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember?
Yeah, were yuh? I was-I was at an Alice Cooper thing where six people were rushed to the hospital with bad vibes.

## LINE You know, it must need to have had its leading from one thought to another. You know what I'm talking about?
He's screaming his opinions in my ear.

## What are you depressed about?
LINE It's like Samuel Beckett, you know- I admire the technique but he doesn't... he doesn't hit me on a gut level.

## Probably on their first date, right?
LINE It's a narrow view.

## Oh, do yuh?
LINE Yes.

## Oh, when'd you quit smoking?
Sixteen years ago.

## May I see your license, please?
Don't give me your life story just pick up the license.

## Look, now, Charlie, give me a big laugh here.
Right, Max, forget it. Aren't you gonna be late for meeting Annie?

## Do you realize how immoral this all is?
Max, I've got a hit series.

## What's the matter?
I don't know, I just got-I got very dizzy... I feel dizzy, Max.

## You wanna lie down?
No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt queasy all morning. I just started getting...

## How about a ginger ale?
Oh, Max... no, I maybe I better lie down.

## You like this house, Max?
M'hm.

## What difference does that make?
I think he has a little thing for Annie.

## Where?
The one with the V.P.L.

## V.P.L.?
Visible panty line. Max, she is gorgeous.

## Yeah, she's a ten, Max, and that's great for you because you're-you're used to twos, aren't you?
And I think they just came back from Masters and Johnson.

## No, no, I came out here to get some shock therapy, but there was an energy crisis, so I... He's my-my food taster. Have you two met?
Hi. How do you do.

## Twins, Max. Sixteen-year-olds. Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities?
You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.

## Max, are we driving through plutonium?
She was stealing.

## SO?
So the colored have enough trouble.

## I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.
How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more?

## I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?
If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.

## Oh, yes, that's right. Did you see the new play?
Oh, you remember her, Annie.

## You think so? Do you really?
We're going to take them to the airport.

## Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?
No, no, no, not at all.

## Oh. What about?
...of possibly working together.

## You can have it to use. Why-why are you smiling?
I don't know. I don't know.

## Uh, how did this personality come about?
I was very charming.

## There were many men interested in you?
Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.

## How long have you worked for the Therrians?
A long time.

## So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
Oh yes.

## Did you know the contractor?
Very well.

## Was it a contractor?
It's the way they do things.

## Did you see permits? Did he have a license?
You should talk to Mr. Joe.

## A triumph. When did you get here?
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.

## Why didn't you come in?
I hate the sight of blood. You guys don't take prisoners.

## Anouk isn't like a dog, really. More like a small person. So is there anyone here for me? No one looks new. Who's that?
You don't want that. It's married and it's the neighbor.

## Oh I think he's cute. How's the marriage part working out?
You're fucking desperate.

## Like you didn't know. Who invited the bimbo?
One guess.

## Jack. Did you compose that yourself?
Absolutely.

## Had a little help?
Absolutely not.

## The neighbors from hell. The kind that lay in wait. I'd rather move actually. Wouldn't I? Wouldn't I?
Can we... one at a time? Hold it down, and one at a time. You're last, Cal.

## Why last?
It's going. It's going.

## Isn't Skye amazing?
She's got great tits.

## Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and... The wisdom. She's an old soul. She knew that Shostakovich thing. Did you notice?
Absolutely. And she's got great tits.

## No, what?
The movie.

## Who, Sally?
I still think she sails above the rest. I mean not like her early films. But those were all such great directors.

## Any thoughts on casting yet?
Leo? It was out to Jude Law. Jude passed.

## Well, I can't make any promises, and of course I haven't read the script but I loved the novel...when are you shooting?
October-ish.

## Five years ago, I was at the party, remember?
She already has.

## It's alright, isn't it?
It's an object lesson in grace. Wow! Look who's here before me! My leading man is on time for once.

## Honey?
I'll be fine. Really babe. Give me a minute.

## Why didn't you bring him?
He's allergic.

## Didn't I say?
Well, probably.

## Whatever you like. I'm afraid it'll all be too big for you. Are you alright, Clair?
I'm fine. I'm fine. Well, I'm a little stressed. And I've been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby.

## You want a Tylenol, or something?
I'd love a Xanex. Sally, please don't tell Sophia that I'm not breast feeding.

## Why would she care?
You need to knock off the pills, Clair.

## Don't you miss it?
Never.

## What is that thing?
So this sitter can always reach me. I'm still not used to leaving him.

## Are you the funniest person I know, or what?
I can't think how you gave it all up, Soph.

## Would you leave us alone right now?
I love her too, Joe.

## That for us?
What a nose. You missed your calling.

## Please?
Directing suits you.

## When does he graduate high school?
Oh, very jealous.

## So?
I love you, Joe Therrian.

## Let's go upstairs, okay?
The suspense is killing me.

## And?
Lucy overdosed.

## And you know our friends, how?
We live next door.

## Excuse me?
We've heard lots about you.

## You have?
Well it's fucking time.

## Are you my big brave boy? Are you my brave hero?
You're crazy baby. I love you.

## Do you want me to save you? Do you want me to save you?
Oh yeah... I'm gonna save you.

## Oh yeah?
Let me heal you, baby.

## Hm. Do you like fucking out of doors?
Not as a rule.

## Hey! Would you?
It was fifteen seconds.

## He's okay, Clair. You wanna give him a little room?
Man, I must really be stoned. Thanks, buddy.

## So, you've got lifeguard papers, or what?
We closed.

## We've only been over this how many times?
You only made half your quote this year.

## Did you invite them?
The Roses? And of course they said yes.

## Did you tell Joe to behave?
Yes.

## Did he promise?
Scout's honor.

## How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?
Beats a lawsuit.

## What was it? What the fuck was it?
Ryan's novel.

## Ryan's novel?
No luck.

## Oh, well, we'll just have to try again. Sound like a plan?
Happy anniversary, baby.

## What did you get me?
In the morning, after everyone's gone and there's just us.

## Through the sweats or not?
Not.

## No. Did you?
No. I missed that.

## I missed all of you. We're okay, aren't we?
We're great.

## What?
Okay. I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you. It was the only chance I had to meet her.

## No, no of course not. How old is she? Twenty-fucking-two?
And she's a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake.

## Really?
Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.

## Who'd like to go and find Otis?
Yes.

## Well, not yet. The gate was open?
It's taken care of.

## Truce?
Truce.

## Listen to yourself... Don't worry, it's alright. We'll find him. What's wrong with you?
She left the fucking gate open.

## Love?
You walked out on a five year marriage.

## And how hard it hit?
Just stop right there, Sally. We've been through this.

## Right. And when was the last time you spoke to her?
It's a novel.

## Hello? Last birthday was?
I don't look my age, Joe.

## Who? Who? Who thinks that?
Your director and your co-star of your current movie. Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.

## Cal, too?
Sally, for Christ's sake.

## Anyone else?
This is insanity. Sally...

## Alright, good. Thanks for your trouble. So will you leave Sally and me alone right now?
Everybody hates the messenger.

## Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it?
I guess.

## Will you make love with me?
Sure.

## Panes! How are you?
Oh, you know, I am.

## What's a sign for that?
Come on, Panes...

## Coffee?
Sure.

## Thanks, I'll take that. Champagne?
Lovely.

## I love gifts. What did you guys get us?
Nothing that can't be exchanged.

## I'm not much of a reader, but I do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes. Mostly non-fiction. Did you read the new Styron?
No.

## Don't I find what?
You manage to throw me off balance. I adore you.

## And so I always manage to, do you see? Like the book/script thing, do you see?
Mmm hmmm.

## The infamous dog?
He's the best dog in the world. They're both coming tonight. Not my idea.

## You lose this?
Ah there's our snookums now.

## You got your DP?
What? Oh yeah, the camera man? They gave me a list.

## Not particularly. Weird, isn't it? God I'm rally up. Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
Kind of. Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends. And great DP's I could give them a call for you.

## God, I really need to jump about a bit. How's your film going?
Well, you know...good days, bad days.

## Right away. Are you sure you wouldn't like something soft, Ryan?
Your Eames table is incredible. And the B&B. I just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red.

## Sally did all this herself?
Mmm. It says something about the two of you maybe.

## What?
But you're very private people. You know, there's a kind of elitism...

## Elitism?
I don't think so. I feel. I feel a bit funny.

## What am I, five?
You're never too old for a lolly. I'm having one.

## Lemon or raspberry?
Lemon.

## And he doesn't smoke?
He has to find non-smoker's meetings that used to be almost impossible, you know? It's gotten much better.

## How long have you been married?
Nine...nine, yes? Nine years, just about.

## Sorry?
Yeah, it was. For a writer nothing's sacred. No, nothing at all.

## How do you do, Skye?
Yeah, well, it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends.

## What?
No, it's not... Fuck fuck fuck fuck.

## How's he doing?
Not good.

## Do you want to go home, Ryan?
Yes.

## Are you making an ass of yourself?
There's only you, Ryan. You know what, Ryan? You're beautiful. I love you so much... You need...

## Ready to go?
I'm going to go get my swimsuit. I do know, Ryan, this is non addictive so you mustn't worry. Ryan, you're a great man.

## Excuse me?
All the ugly phone calls? We're not the only people with a tape recorder, Ryan. They've gone to the canyon, we should go towards the PCH.

## Sally?
Yes. And you've met Joe.

## Hors d'oeuvres or something?
Yes, great! It's a beautiful house.

## How long ago was it?
Come on in.

## Oh my god. I've been so rude. I'm Skye Davidson. Has anyone ever told you, you look like Peter Sellers?
No, never.

## Is there space here?
Yes.

## Do you need anything else?
No, no thanks.

## Oh?
The charades.

## Oh?
The Shostakovich.

## Really?
I'll tell you who doesn't know, cute girls don't know.

## Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich?
Yeah.

## Would you, like, marry him?
If he were still alive, maybe.

## Are you asking me to marry you?
No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are.

## Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two?
Who told you that? No. I'm twenty... Five.

## Are you lovesick?
Suicidal. It's much less codependent.

## Will champagne help?
Not enough.

## She's all over him, are you blind?
It could be worse.

## How?
She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours.

## Like your business managers?
They're not just our business managers, Panes.

## What does that mean?
About five thousand dollars. With my discount.

## Why don't you go fuck yourself?
No. Really. For real. Really.

## How's the movie going? Your movie. You are making a movie, aren't you?
Yes. Fine.

## That's it? Yes. Fine?
I don't want to talk about it.

## Why not?
I never like to talk about my work.

## Oh you know. No doubts. No second thoughts. Am I a monster?
You're my best friend.

## That's not an answer, is it?
Yes, you're a monster.

## Panes?
From Jewish Folk Poetry, a song cycle...

## What did I do?
Panes is not on my team anymore. I'll have Panes if I like.

## You're keeping a record, are you?
It's just very distracting when you're trying to work.

## Absolutely. You always wonder where your books end up. Why don't we use it?
Oh my God, sorry. I'm interrupting.

## What are they?
You don't need to do that.

## Like Joe.
Oh my God! America told me your neighbors are coming?

## Hmm. Where are my kids?
In the guest room. I've laid out a paint table for them.

## Isn't this a fabulous picture?
Yes.

## So where should I put it?
I thought it was okay where it was.

## We're always in here. She really gets him, doesn't she?
The both of you.

## So how much do you hate her?
Big time.

## Well, are you sure about this baby thing? It's not the ticking clock shit, is it?
Oh Soph, Joe loves kids. Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids.

## Cal knows who he is. Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
You weren't exactly horrified.

## Why are you doing this?
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.

## This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground. Why are we even digging this thing?
Who cares, Z. All I know is, we gotta dig. We're not the ones in charge.

## Hey, slow it down, big boy. You're making the rest of us look bad...How come I haven't seen you around here before?
I'm new...I was born yesterday.

## Are you asking me out to dinner?
No -- I mean yes -- I mean -- if you don't have other plans.

## You miss him? Why?
Well, if single-handedly vanquishing the enemy and slaughtering a whole nestful of termites makes someone a hero, yes I am.

## And you are...?
I'm Princess Bala.

## Ah, yes. Well, charmed, I'm sure. So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero?
Yes.

## Divinely?
No weirdly...You remind me of someone...

## He was a worker. I danced with him at a worker's bar just the other day. I'm not shocking you, am I?
No...as a matter of fact...

## Stop fooling around in there.
Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?

## Princess, has it ever occurred to you that they're not going to rescue you?
General Formica won't let me die out here. I'm his fiancee.

## Look. How many other Princesses are there?
Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no. About five thousand four hundred by now.

## So what makes you so special?
Well...I am the oldest.

## Forget it. You go ahead, I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. \"Insectopia\".
Yes?

## So...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night?
Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.

## Oh no...
Why do they have you tied up here?

## Z! what are you doing?
I mean, I've got the whole package, right? A great life, a beautiful wife, and a few kids.

## A few?
The Club's so stuffy. I want to try someplace different.

## You did?
Yes...he's wonderful...

## Trial membership? Kid, when you join this ant's army, you're in for the full hitch.
Who is that idiot?

## Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?
No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks.

## Princess! You look -- outstanding. Is there anything I can do for you?
Actually, sir, we're ahead of schedule. We have thirty-six seconds available right now.

## Outstanding. Princess...?
No one should have to. Have him brought to me.

## What do we have on this \"Insectopia\"?
Scattered reports, sir. Rumors. Nothing reliable.

## So this Z...he fancies himself an individual?
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.

## Thank you, sir.
Well now you haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?

## So tell me. Where's Z?
I...I have no idea, sir.

## Royal victory party? Will...will Princess Bala be there?
Of course. The entire royal family will be there to honor you.

## Engaged? As in you're getting married?
Affirmative.

## So...you two are in love?
Wow, what a spread -- you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony.

## Well I, I don't think \"living it up\" is the right term -- how about \"working themselves to death\"?
Oh, hey, that's great, I think I see an old war buddy over there, it's been fun chatting. Good luck with the hallucinations.

## Can't we all settle this like adults -- we're not larvae anymore --
We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...

## I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
Yes, General Formica. Carry on, my good man! I don't know what we would do without you.

## Your majesty, I'm afraid matters of state keep me from attending the ceremony.
Conversation...yes...well... Wasn't she briefed?

## But General -- this tunnel is your baby! You're sure you can't stay ?
Ask me why we're so successful.

## What do you see out there?
...Ants...

## We declared war again? Are you scared?
I'll be back.

## Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me. Don't you want your aphid beer?
I can't help it. I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature. Call me crazy.

## Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
Of course. You were born two seconds after me.

## Yeah, I know.
Will you introduce me to some worker girls?

## I'm getting lonely. Who are you talking to, anyway?
My mother.

## Yeah. How much?
You sure this is a good idea? DOBISCH Can't think of a better one.

## I mean - barging in on your mother -- in the middle of the night?
Don't worry about the old lady. One squawk from her, and she's out of a job.

## So this is your mother's apartment?
That's right. Maria Ouspenskaya. BLONDE Hiya, Ouspenskaya.

## Something the matter?
I seem to have dropped my key. Oh -- here it is.

## Mrs. Dreyfuss, can I borrow some coffee -- and maybe an orange and a couple of eggs?
Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.

## From me the doctor has no secrets. Poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that?
Big shot! For you, I wouldn't lift a finger -- but for her, I'll fix a little something to eat.

## Beatnik! Go to my kitchen -- third drawer, under the good silver, there is napkins.
You wouldn't have such a thing as a napkin, would you?

## One napkin, coming up. I wish we had some champagne to wrap it around.
So what are you waiting for -- a singing commercial?

## All right -- I'll tell him. Hey, Baxter -- that was Personnel. Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
What did I tell you?

## Sheldrake?
It's a bet.

## It was making me nervous, so I chopped it off. Big mistake, huh?
I sort of like it.

## Why?
Well, to make the figures come out even -- since I have no colds a year -- some poor slob must have five colds a year.

## I hope everything goes all right.
Really?

## I hope so. Wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this -- with my cold and everything -- How do I look?
Fine. Wait.

## Oh -- Miss Kubelik. I've been waiting for you. FRAN You have?
I almost didn't recognize you -- this is the first time I've ever seen you in civilian clothes.

## Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
No.

## Would you like to?
Yeah.

## Oh. You mean -- like a girl-friend?
No. Like a man.

## This date -- is it just a date -- or is it something serious?
It used to be serious -- at least I was -- but he wasn't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt.

## What time does the show go on?
Eight-thirty.

## How is your cold?
What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town -- I've been taking from Arthur Murray.

## How come?
A couple of months ago I looked up your card in the group insurance file.

## What gave you that idea?
In the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once -- and then you didn't take your hat off.

## One more?
I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.

## By the power vested in me, I herewith declare this elevator out of order. Shall we join the natives?
Why not? They seem friendly enough.

## How many of those drinks did you have?
Three.

## You all right? What's the matter?
Nothing. There are just too many people here.

## Guess I made a boo-boo, huh?
No -- I like it.

## Really? You mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?
Of course not.

## Maybe if I wore it a little more to the side -- is that better?
Much better.

## He and I are like this. Sent me a Christmas card. See?
I'm afraid there are too many other girls around here with seniority over me.

## I'm so ashamed. Why didn't you just let me die?
What kind of talk is that? So you got a little over- emotional -- but you're fine now.

## My head -- it feels like a big wad of chewing gum. What time is it?
Two o'clock.

## Here. How about some breakfast?
No -- I don't want anything.

## Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik?
My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.

## Wait a minute -- let's talk this over first. Just what are you going to tell her?
Well, I haven't figured it out, exactly.

## You better figure it out -- exactly. Suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night?
I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.

## Who?
Someone from the office.

## And where are you now?
In his apartment.

## His apartment?
I mean -- her apartment.

## What's your friend's name?
Baxter.

## What's her first name?
Miss.

## When are you coming home?
As soon as I can walk.

## Something wrong with your legs?
No -- it's my stomach.

## Your stomach?
They had to pump it out.

## Yes, I've got it. Don't you think we'd better destroy it? So it won't fall into the wrong hands -- ?
Open it.

## That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
Sure.

## You want me to move the television set in here? You play gin rummy?
I'm not very good at it.

## Why do people have to love people, anyway?
Yeah -- I know what you mean. Queen.

## A bad insurance risk?
That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go -- first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.

## A cemetery?
I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.

## I just have this talent for falling in love with the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. BUD How many guys were there?
You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.

## Was he really upset when you told him?
Mr. Sheldrake? Oh, yes. Very.

## You really think so?
No doubt about it.

## What for?
I'm going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.

## Miss Kubelik, I don't think that's such a good idea.
You are?

## Why not?
Well, for one thing, you can't spell. And secondly -- if you did something like that -- you'd hate yourself.

## Do I have to?
You bet. I got a terrific hand.

## You sure you want to throw that card?
Sure.

## Would you mind opening the window?
Now don't go getting any ideas, Miss Kubelik.

## Who'd care?
I would.

## Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
-- Mr. Sheldrake.

## Gas. Didn't you turn it on?
Yes. I was boiling some water to get the coffee stains out of my dress.

## Are you supposed to?
In this house, you're supposed to.

## What are you doing with that?
I was washing my stockings, so I decided I might as well do your socks.

## Tennis racquet? Oh, I remember -- I was cooking myself an Italian dinner. I used it to strain the spaghetti. FRAN Why not?
As a matter of fact, I'm a pretty good cook -- but I'm a lousy housekeeper.

## A what?
Some people take, some people get took -- and they know they're getting took -- and there's nothing they can do about it.

## You did?
Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.

## Over a girl?
No, I don't.

## Where?
Here.

## That's terrible.
In the knee?

## Of course not. Here's the fruit cake. And you want to see my knee?
No, thanks. The fellows in the office may get the wrong idea how I found out.

## Are we dressing for dinner?
No -- just come as you are.

## Shall I light the candles?
It's a must -- gracious-living-wise.

## You usually eat alone?
Cheers.

## I don't?
We're going to finish that gin game.

## Fine. How's your eye?
Fine.

## I know. I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.

## Oh.
Yes. You walking to the subway?

## Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
No. You know how people talk. So I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise.

## Are you all right?
I'm fine.

## Are you sure? How's your knee?
I'm fine all over.

## Mind if I come in?
Of course not.

## That's funny -- so am I. What did you do with the cards?
In there.

## What about Mr. Sheldrake?
I'm going to send him a fruit cake every Christmas.

## Some weather we're having. Must be from all the meshugass at Cape Canaveral. You locked out of your apartment?
No, no. Just waiting for a friend. Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.

## All that marching -- tramp, tramp, tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.

## What for?
I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.

## Baxter?
And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.

## Tell me, Baxter -- just what is it that makes you so popular?
I don't know.

## The Vice Squad?
That's right, Baxter.

## Who?
Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C. C. Baxter.

## You better.
Are you going to deny it?

## I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter -- I want to swap them.
How would you like to go tonight?

## I am?
Now put down the key -- -- and put down the address.

## Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway, it's none of my business -- four apples, five apples -- what's the difference -- percentage-wise?
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.

## Don't thank me -- thank your friends here -- they're the ones who recommended you.
Morning, gentlemen. Everything satisfactory? You like your office?

## I like the way you handled that. Well, how does it feel to be an executive?
Yes, sir. You can't be too careful.

## To me?
I mean -- the young lady -- whoever she may be -- it was on the couch when I got home last night.

## Sir?
You know how it is -- sooner or later they all give you a bad time.

## What?
I thought maybe you'd like to be here when she wakes up.

## And I've got good news for you, Baxter. All your troubles are over.
Good. Is there anything you need -- money -- ?

## Sir?
I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik -- well, stop worrying -- I'm going to take her off your hands.

## You're going to take her off my hands?
That's right. I've moved out of my house -- I'm going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club.

## Now what was your news, Baxter?
It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.

## Mine?
Yes, sir.

## Yes, sir.
Oh?

## I suppose you'll be on the town tonight -- celebrating?
Very clever.

## What do you mean, sorry?
You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.

## No key!
I dig.

## Now you're being bright?
Thank you, sir.

## What's gotten into you, Baxter?
Just following doctor's orders. I've decided to become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.

## How do you do, Mr. Matuschka?
Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab downstairs.

## Fran been sick or something?
No, no -- just had a little accident.

## What does he mean, accident?
On account of me.

## Who else?
Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to complain -- but you were supposed to be out of here by eight.

## Mr. Sheldrake?
Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby.

## Oh, how are you, Baxter. They keeping you busy these days?
Yes, sir. They are indeed.

## A lot of guys around here have tried it -- all kinds of approaches -- no dice. What is she trying to prove?
Could be she's just a nice, respectable girl -- there are millions of them.

## What do you want?
What do I -- ? Just a minute.

## What's the matter with you, Buddy- boy? I made a reservation for four o'clock, remember?
Look, you can't stay here. Just take your champagne and go.

## Hiya, Buddy-boy. I'm in this bar on Sixty-first Street -- and I got to thinking about you -- and I figured I'd give you a little buzz.
Baxter, I don't want to pull rank on you -- but I told the lady it was all set -- you want to make a liar out of me?

## Well, that's very nice of you -- but who is this?
Dobisch -- Joe Dobisch, in Administration.

## I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch. You know I like to help you guys out -- but it's sort of late -- so why don't we make it some other time?
Buddy-boy -- she won't keep that long -- not even on ice. Listen, kid, I can't pass this up -- she looks like Marilyn Monroe.

## Of course not. But -- how can I be efficient in the office if I don't get enough sleep at night?
It's only eleven -- and I just want the place for forty-five minutes.

## Make it thirty minutes. What do you say, Bud?
I'm all out of liquor -- and there's no clean glasses -- no cheese crackers -- no nothing.

## Teamwork -- that's what counts in an organization like this. All for one and one for all -- know what I mean?
I have a vague idea.

## You threatening me?
Listen, Baxter, we made you and we can break you.

## Hi, Doc. Had a late call?
Yeah. Some clown at Schrafft's 57th Street ate a club sandwich, and forgot to take out the toothpick.

## When you make out your will -- and the way you're going, you should -- would you mind leaving your body to the University?
My body? I'm afraid you guys would be disappointed. Good night, Doc.

## What are you going to do, Doc?
Get that stuff out of her stomach -- if it isn't too late. You better put some coffee on -- and pray.

## You know, Baxter, you're a real cutie-pie -- yes, you are.
Want to tell me what happened?

## What's her name?
Miss Kubelik -- Fran.

## Any of that coffee left?
Sure.

## How do you spell her last name?
Kubelik -- with two k's.

## Why do you want to know, Doc? You don't have to report this, do you?
Help yourself.

## How's the patient?
Oh, I'm fine, Doc.

## What's this -- you packing?
Yeah -- I'm giving up the apartment.

## Forget it -- I didn't do it as a doctor -- I did it as a neighbor. By the way, whatever happened to her?
You know me with girls. Easy come, easy go. Goodbye, Doc.

## You like Castro? I mean -- how do you feel about Castro? BUD What is Castro?
You know, that big-shot down in Cuba with the crazy beard.

## What about him?
Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.

## Who is Mickey?
My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.

## Oh. Mixed up in that revolution?
Mickey? He wouldn't do nothing like that. He's a jockey. They caught him doping a horse.

## Twas the night before Christmas And all through the house Not a creature was stirring -- Nothing -- No action -- Dullsville! You married?
No.

## Family?
No.

## Where do we go -- my place or yours?
Might as well go to mine -- everybody else does.

## Poor Mickey -- when I think of him all by himself in that jail in Havana -- -- want to see his picture?
Not particularly.

## Can I ask you a personal question?
No.

## You got a girl-friend?
She may be a girl -- but she's no friend of mine.

## Good night?
The party's over.

## What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
It's an emergency -- see you some other time.

## Nothing. Just clear out, will you?
Kubelik.

## A.W.O.L.?
What gripes me is the two of them were guzzling my champagne while Sylvia and I wound up at the Guggenheim Museum.

## I see. What do you think, Al? Can we help the man?
Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.

## Hit by a swinging door? Or maybe a Yellow Cab?
That guy really must've belted him.

## Tell me again -- what's my name?
Dr. Dreyfuss.

## And what happened to you?
I took sleeping pills.

## Do you know where you are, Fran?
No.

## What's with you, Fran -- did you forget where you live?
This is my brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.

## What for?
Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.

## Why did you take sleeping pills?
You fool -- you damn fool.

## Hi. How's the branch manager from Kansas City?
Well -- thank you.

## Still afraid somebody may see us together?
Let me take that.

## No, Jeff. I can't stay very long. Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
It's on the way. I see you went ahead and cut your hair.

## Six weeks. But who's counting?
I want you back, Fran.

## Not here, Fran. Can't we go some place else?
No. I have a date at eight-thirty.

## Important?
Not very -- but I'm going to be there anyway.

## Remember what we talked about?
We talked about a lot of things.

## What do you think?
Let's get something straight, Jeff -- I never asked you to leave your wife.

## You'll miss your train, Jeff.
Are you sure that's what you want?

## Coming?
Sorry it took me so long on the phone. But we're all set.

## All set for what?
I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.

## Atlantic City?
I know it's a drag -- but you can't find a hotel room in town -- not on New Year's Eve.

## Baxter?
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.

## What are you talking about?
I'd spell it out for you -- only I can't spell.

## What guy? Whose apartment is this, anyway?
I told you -- with my mother.

## Where does she live?
A hundred and seventy-ninth street -- the Bronx.

## You mean you bring other girls up here?
Certainly not. I'm a happily married man.

## Okay, okay. Look, Sylvia -- instead of Friday - could we make it Thursday night?
Thursday? That's The Untouchables -- with Bob Stack.

## What gives?
A little mixup in signals. Let's go.

## What's your mother doing this afternoon?
She's home -- stuffing a turkey.

## Did you have a nice Christmas?
Lovely. You were a big help.

## Hey, Dad -- why don't we put a fly in the nose cone and see if we can bring it back alive?
It's a thought.

## Where are you headed?
What's it matter? Get to the point.

## Now just a second -- I'm doing you a favor, buddy -- what're you trying to pull?
We need all our fuel anyway.

## Moonby what?
Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Task Force. Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted.

## How about a drink ?
Sure, thanks.

## Which part is that ?
My part. Beer, with ice and water.

## Delta ?
No.

## North ?
Yeah. Way north.

## What unit were you with ?
None.

## Rangers, eh?
Sort of.

## Tracks ?
Yeah.

## At least you always have enough water. How many gallons does each one of those damn things carry ?
Thirty -- sometimes fifty.

## How long were you up there ?
A long time.

## Who are you ?
It's really too much -- I mean I've collected every picture of her since she was Miss December.

## So what happened ?
Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.

## What did you put in all those ammo boxes?
Arch light.

## What are you doing out here?
Cook school -- that did it.

## How?
I don't know.

## How much is left?
Less than half -- sure is a mess down there.

## And the grass?
Still got a lot of that stuff from Nha Trang. But we're running low on the other.

## Charlie?
Looks that way.

## Who's he?
God knows.

## What are we doing here?
Kurtz. I'm supposed to kill him, just like he said.

## You forgot the mangoes, didn't you?
Elevate Lance, in the tree. No, I saw another.

## What'd he say?
Said I speak French like a Spanish cow.

## We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ?
Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down.

## Where ?
We found some bodies -- let's get out a here.

## Can't be any worse than this. What do you think?
I think this river wants to take us home fast. I'm practically goin' in reverse.

## What the hell is it?
In the middle of the jungle -- a goddamn light.

## When'd you do it?
While you were sleeping.

## What is it?
Listen.

## Will they attack?
If they have boats ... or canoes... they'd get lost in the fog. We can't move either -- we'll end up on the shore.

## Which way? Right or left?
Who knows? Right.

## Anybody see some smoke ?
Too far inland.

## What cat ?
One that went up for murder -- he was an Army Sergeant.

## Forget that extra drum -- it's too damn hot.
They nail him for it bad ?

## I wonder if that was the same copter.
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?

## What do you want ?
If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon Group, we'd like you to come with us.

## Whose orders ?
I only met Kurtz once.

## Would he remember you ?
Maybe.

## What does that mean ?
Maybe it's not Kurtz. I don't believe he's capable of that. I just don't believe it.

## Our Recon flight ?
Ours.

## Terminate ?
Terminate with extreme prejudice.

## Hey, buddy, that boat still runs, eh?
Yeah, it still runs.

## What is it?
What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow.

## Charlie?
No, it'd be spooky without the war -- give 'em back.

## Charlie?
NVA regulars. They're coming again tonight. Tet -- their big -- assault.

## Who is he?
He was the tragedy -- the tragedy of this war.

## How did they know?
They must have seen the fire.

## This gentleman or myself ?
No, sir.

## I believe on your last job you executed a tax collector in Kontum, is that right ?
I am not presently disposed to discuss that, sir.

## You know much about about Special Forces; Green Berets, Captain ?
I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir.

## A lame ?
This is years ago, before he joined Special Forces, I guess. We had an argument.

## About what ?
I don't know. He was a lame, that's all.

## But why ?
He couldn't get through a sentence without all these big words; about why we kill.

## American weapons?
We took them from the dead. Now -- I assume you want to rest, to shower. We'll attend to your repairs after dinner.

## Captain?
You'll get blown outta here some day.

## Do you know that jungle?
When I was a boy, my father would take me there, to hunt. There are a few savages, but no man can live there, no white man.

## What about an American named Kurtz?
Two of my men deserted last night. It happens from time to time. I assume my daughter told you of our conditions.

## What's your name, sailor ?
Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.

## Lance Johnson? The surfer?
That's right, sir.

## Where've you been riding, Lance?
I haven't surfed since I got here.

## What, sir?
I said it's a good swell -- hell of a good swell 'bout six feet. Let's get a look at it.

## You think that section on the point is ridable, Lance?
I think we ought to wait for the tide to come in.

## Yeah -- yeah, I can understand how you feel.
They far enough?

## Mike, you know anything about the point at Vin Drip Drop?
Boss left.

## What do you mean?
It's really long left slide, breaks on the short side of the point -- catches a south swell.

## How big it is?
Six to eight feet.

## Wh -- what?
Change -- get out there -- I want'a see if it's ridable -- change.

## You want'a surf, soldier?
Big Duke Six to Hell's Angels Four -- bring it in on along tree line and huts.

## Why the hell you wanna go up to Nu Mung Ba for?
I got bored in Saigon.

## What's the furthest you been in?
Haiphong.

## Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?
No. Walked.

## What'd you do for supplies?
Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.

## Can you trust them?
Nu Mung Ba. Last I heard, Walter Kurtz commanded a Green Beret detachment at Nu Mung Ba.

## Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz still alive?
Who knows.

## Don't you agree?
He musta changed ! I got to get into the Nung River, here or here.

## Hairy ?
I mean it's hairy -- they got some pretty heavy ordnance, boy -- I've lost a few recon ships in there now and again.

## What about this point here?
We'll come in low out of the rising sun -- We'll put on the music about a mile out.

## Music?
Yeah. Classical stuff -- scares the hell out of the slopes -- the boys love it.

## Sonuvabitch -- anybody hurt?
Automatic weapons flashes along those trees -- probably eleven millimeter guns and AK-47's.

## You were not coming here, to see me?
No -- no, sir.

## What other reason could you have come? A Captain. Ranger. Paratrooper. Graduate of the Recondo School. Am I right about these things?
You know you're right.

## Do you know me?
Yeah, I like it...

## How's yours?
I can handle it.

## What Truth?
Because of all the things we do, the thing we do best -- is lie.

## What are you doing?
Going back - to the jungle to die.

## Did you know him very well?
You get to know each other pretty well out there.

## Maybe he'll get tubed.
And you admired him?

## What?
Maybe he'll get inside the tube -- where -- where they can't see him.

## What's that?
Just something I read in the Free Press.

## Are you finished surfing?
Yeah... thanks.

## Want to say goodbye to the Colonel?
Nah.

## Which one's the Colonel's?
The Yater -- the clear one with the thin stringer.

## He didn't look like he'd take that sitting down.
This one , Lance?

## You hear it again?
No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back.

## When?
Any time -- us -- Americans.

## Captain -- that was all true about the rats and chocolate and stuff?
Sure.

## What's this tiger shit?
No shit... I think I shot the hell out of him.

## You think?
Bring your rifles, that's all. Take us to him.

## Captain Willard?
That's me.

## Why?
Now I can get out a here -- if I can find a way out.

## What is this bridge?
It's of strategic importance for keeping the highway into Bat Shan open -- the generals don't like to admit that Bat Shan is surrounded.

## Why did they attack us?
Simple. They don't want him to go.

## You're Australian?
Sounds like he's gone crazy.

## Who are you?
His name is...

## May I ask where the Captain is going in his little boat?
We were going upriver when we got caught in a storm, ma'am.

## Cognac?
I should be checking on the boat.

## Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you someone there?
No. Not really.

## What will you do after the war?
I just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones.

## What's a big question?
Kurtz. I know you've heard of him.

## What did you hear?
That strange things.. terrible things have occured around this American, Kurtz.

## What things?
Gaston would never tell me. It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain.

## Did you know -- deeper in the jungle, upriver -- there are savages?
I know.

## Are you warm, Captain?
The river is beautiful.

## Well, you know I don't have the priority to do that, sir. It says here not to contact Com-Sec- Int. Who's your commanding officer ?
Right now -- I am.

## Well who the hell verifies that ?
I do.

## That's 27, sir.
What show ?

## Son of a bitch, sir.
Anyone got a card?

## Mind if I get some stuff from my kit?
CONTINUED

## How long have you been up north?
Six months.

## Had?
She's dead.

## -- Corbett's a killer.
How did she..?

## What happened here?
The radio's on the fritz.

## Where'd you say Eric is?
It's out by the pumping station, shot full of holes.

## What are you doing?
He still might be around. I saw fresh tire tracks coming in.

## Bastards took off, though, didn't they?
Thanks.

## Did you catch Corbett?
Sure did. He was one of the trappers we rousted from the Haul Road.

## Was there any trouble?
I thought I should check our emergency transmitters.

## Be careful, okay?
That's my line.

## What's going on?
I'll tell you everything later.

## Where's Corbett?
Here. A transport plane is due at eleven. Once I put him on it, it's all over.

## So what's the problem?
Please, Anne Marie, you being here only complicates things.

## Ben Corbett?
Yep. Afraid you have me at a disadvantage.

## No big deal. We just got off on the wrong foot. What's your name?
Desmond.

## New to the country, kid?
Six months. Ecological study for Northland Oil.

## Does he have people?
A daughter in Oregon.

## How the hell were they smart enough to find us?
Smart? Sure. That's why I'm sitting in this plane and they're down there blowing me kisses.

## Been driving long?
Next time you want to kill yourself, don't include me.

## Why in hell you care enough about me to die taking me in?
I don't plan on dying.

## Most dangerous thing in the world, A regular Joe, in over his head. You trying to prove how tough you are for me, or for yourself?
It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.

## You know Meyerling?
Sure. The People's Friend. Kiss your ass with precision if there's a vote in it.

## Yeah?
Yep. Sometimes they do, but usually they end up crazy or dead.

## You don't get it, do you?
What?! Fuck off. Save yourself.

## You don't feel cold?
It's a spring day...

## Where's my ELT?
Emergency transmitter? All your gear is back at Wilder's.

## You got one?
I'm sure she's fine. Seemed like a clever kid.

## Emergency transmitter? What happened to signal mirrors or two-tone smoke fires?
Answer and I'll shoot!

## Can you walk?
Wound's a through-and-through. Missed my liver, I think.

## How come you didn't let him shoot me?
Like I said, I'd still be up on that mountain, frozen solid, it wasn't for you.

## Hullo, Sam. Slow day?
Ben...boys. Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way.

## Relax. One more day without drink won't kill you. Right, Sam?
I'm living proof of that sad fact.

## Can we buy the Marshal some dinner?
No, I better stay at my post.

## All this for laying traps on private land?
Christ if I shouldn't know better than to step in soft earth. I've seen footprints in the tundra a hundred years old.

## Sam, give Dixie here fifty bucks out of my kit, will you?
Sam, listen -- I shot to defend my man. Other guy drew first.

## -- Forget it. And try not to bleed on my throw rugs. Why do this?
If you have to ask, you wouldn't understand.

## Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
Back at my place... he, uh, broke his leg.

## Jiminy Christmas. What do you want from me?
Corbett ruined my two-way. Go to my place on the Haul Road, tell Anne Marie I'm okay and to sit tight.

## Look, Mr. Desmond, I didn't count on it turning this ugly.
What's wrong?

## Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
There'll be three, four men at the most. I have some backup, nothing will happen.

## I should release Corbett because you want some votes?
Some day these people'll wake up, and you'll be the first one they'll run out of here.

## What'd you say they call these spaceships?
Mobile Arctic Dwelling -- MAD.

## Any idea who could've done it?
...You give us a ride in the Cessna you got hangared at the pumping station, we'll be in Fairbanks in a few hours.

## Wilder's missing church services; you believe it?
I just as soon he stay gone. Fool could've got us all killed, arresting Ben Corbett here in town.

## Why the smirk?
You're out of your greedy goddamn mind.

## LeMalle. We got a problem. Where's Mitchell?
Goddamn! Viking Bob! Mitchell's inside, boring bastard...

## You hear me? Ben?
Ease off. We do this my way.

## Kenai's PA -- but how the fuck she seein' us?
Doesn't matter. We know where they're going. C'mon.

## Okay, let's backtrack, try to pick up his trail. You know the kid out on the pipeline that Wilder's buddies with?
We were just talking about him.

## I didn't know you had a secret admire.
Where's the kid?

## Huh?
You met the gift.

## Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help?
It lets a crazy man into our lives.

## I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean from the bakery to baby-sit so let's go out.

## I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
Go ahead.

## What is it you want? What?
I want us to go out.

## How was it talking to him?
Well, maybe he has nice friends.

## Don't be silly. How bad?
Not bad.

## Hi... Did you know there are doctors who come to your house?
No, I didn't. So why are you h...

## Do you love me?
Uh-huh.

## Not your name... what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
He's in the bathroom... He's fine.

## How long has he been having problems?
Since forever.

## Have they done blood tests on him?
Yes.

## Have they done skin testing for allergies?
No.

## They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin?
No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway.

## Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results?
Me. My home number is on this card.

## Water... Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
No.

## Will you please take it?
I know. He's just the best.

## You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
We're all gonna die soon. I will. You will. It sure sounds like your son will.

## What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours... afraid it isn't clean?
No.

## His name?
Spencer.

## So what are you doing with a dog?
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.

## You're not worried that someone might take him?
Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.

## How old are you?
Oh, please...

## And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age... how old are you?
Otherwise, you're not ugly.

## What's with the dark?
Last week I was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so I decide I'm going to make a little joke...

## You all set here?
I'm hungry. You've upset my whole day. I haven't eaten.

## What are you doing here?
This is not a sexist thing. If you were a waiter I would still be here saying...

## Sorry, honey... I'll be right there.
My son is sick, okay?

## Carol the waitress?
Yes.

## I was working... can't you just drop me a thank-you note?
That's not why I'm here... ... though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about Spencer...

## Why did yo do this for me?
To get you back at work so you can wait on me.

## What needs clearing up?
I'm not going to sleep with you. I will never, ever sleep with you. Never. Not ever.

## Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
Just how grateful I am.

## So you'll be at work?
Yes.

## What's this?
A thank-you note for what you did for me.

## So. Anything else?
Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.

## Hey, what I did for you is working out?
What you did changed my life.

## Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say, \"what?\" I thought I said, \"what?\"... What?
I want you to go on this trip.

## The stiff one eye?
Two days.

## What's that got to do with it?
Funny, I thought it was a strong point.

## Is there another way to see it?
No.

## Are you still coming?
Yes.

## Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
Whether crabs are in season there now...

## Hello... Oh, my God, who did that to you?
I was going to do that for you.

## It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.

## No answer... Maybe we should just drive there tomorrow. Can I have that one?
Yes... sure. I'll take the sofa.

## Dancing?
Stop asking everyone.

## You wanna dance?
I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.

## And?
No... ... I don't get this place. They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. I don't get it.

## Two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer. Baked or fries?
Fries.

## Have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?
Never.

## Sex with Simon?
It's one idea...

## Sorry, didn't realize she was right there. Did you have sex with her?
To hell with sex.

## I'll take you... why not?
Hello.

## How you doing?
I can trust my brain.

## Okay to say something now?
Go ahead.

## What do you want?
Cause if you were asleep -- I'm sorry. And you could be grouchy.

## Grouchy?
... Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try.

## What a break...
What job?

## Is it a secret what you're doing here?
I had to see you...

## Boyfriend?
Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.

## Do you want to know what happened with my parents?
Yes. I really would.

## I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything?
No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.

## Was this supposed to be your room?
Our room. I don't want to see him and he's not going to come knocking on your door.

## Uh-huh...
Can you not be violent?

## Why? What have you been thinking about?
How to die, mostly.

## I just love her. How're you doing?
But what about...

## What the heck are those for?
No. No. Get Carol.

## There's not going to be a debate. You must leave.
What are you trying to do to me?

## I also regrew my beard... but you're not interested in changes in me... so it's like I always told you... when it comes to people you...
You said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease?

## He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?
Won't worry about it. You go ahead.

## So, what's new anyway? How's Verdell?
Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.

## How's Verdell doing?
He's a pain in the ass.

## What?
\"What?\" Look at you... You sense a mark.

## Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... So I'm out. Can you take him?
Think white and get serious.

## Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive?
Like the wind but I'm not doing it.

## Hi. You have hard shells, right?
Yes, we do... And I can give you a tie and jacket.

## What?
They require a tie and jacket but we have some available.

## Shall I get her for you?
No, it's all right. I'll just watch.

## How you doing, great one?
I haven't looked at myself yet. I figured I could tell from your reaction.

## Sorry. What are those cards?
Frank's idea. He thought I should have notes so I did this right... maintained focus, didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you.

## Terrify me?
See, he's right. I need the cards. Simon, you're broke.

## No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
Absolutely.

## Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?
Sure thing.

## What?
Just move on. No one here killed him.

## Oh, is he dead?
Ask him.

## My dog... you know... I mean my little dog with the adorable face... Don't you know what my dog looks like?
I got it. You're talking about your dog. I thought that was the name of the colored man I've been seeing in the hall.

## Which color was that?
Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...

## How're you doing?
Franks shows my work, Mr. Udall. I think you know that.

## Do you realize that I work at him?
No, I didn't.

## Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
No... actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...

## Could you take it just a little easy, Mr. Udall?
Thank you. Verdell... sweetheart? By the way, thanks for saving me.

## Verdell?
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.

## It smells like shit in here?
Go away.

## Where are all your queer party friends?
Get out.

## Nothing worse than having to feel this way in front of you?
Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.

## Would you leave now, please?
Stupid dog. I don't get it.

## Got any easier questions?
Yeah...

## Do you ever get an erection for a woman?
Melvin...

## Does it matter?
I told you to go on in.

## What are you talking about?
Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me.

## They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
I love you.

## You going to come talk to me or not?
I'm coming.

## What did she say?
I'm a great guy -- \"extraordinary\"... ... and she doesn't want contact with me. I'm dying here.

## Because... ... you love her?
No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.

## Did you like it that much?
Picking on me won't help.

## But you know where you're lucky?
Absolutely not.

## What's wrong?
I forgot to lock the door.

## What's it mean?
That somebody out there knows what it's like to be... in here.

## How do you write women so well?
I think of a man and take away reason and accountability.

## Exactly what is your previous experience?
How about that pose? This is not fun... Give me some direction.

## So you're practically finished, huh?
No. No. No. Hey, that painting in there... I just want to tell you...

## No. No problem. The airport, right?
Right.

## So you're from around here?
No. No I'm not.

## Not too good at small talk, eh?
Look, I'm real tired and I'm not interested in fucking chit-chat.

## Why? What happened?
No shit.

## What?
That was Peterson back there. That goes to the expressway for the airport.

## What? You think I'm running you up?
Just do your job.

## What are you doing?
Get out. You think I'm running you up? Get out.

## How long have you been freelance?
We both know what you were doing.

## After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland.
Robert Bain, driving me! Jesus fucking Christ!

## So what happens now?
We go around once.

## What are you doing?
No, no. Wait. You don't want me to jump. You're going to jump. I'm stuck back here until it's too late. Wham -- over!

## How'd you know? Just tell me that. How'd you fucking know?
I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.

## What does that fucking mean?
It means that I'm going to tell you things, even though I already know that you're not going to listen to a God damned thing I say.

## Five million dollars?
That's right.

## You understand what's going on? It makes sense, right?
Oh, yeah.

## Michael?
No. No. No. I don't believe it.

## What?
Sure.

## Where have you been, Robert?
Sick. The flu.

## What?
The contract was stolen.

## Who?
A new player. He's using the name Nicholai.

## Know what?
The fucking contract! How in the fuck did he know.

## Deadline?
Tomorrow. The buyer is Japanese. His retirement a condition of the bonus.

## Who is the mark?
Freelancer. A woman. Surveillance specialist.

## The contract?
Paid in full.

## You think this is a fucking joke?
$1,000,000.

## He has to clean up. How many bodies were there?
Um, five.

## Where are we going?
Nikita? She helped me find you.

## What? How did you know I had a cat?
Took a guess. Lucky for you, I guessed right.

## Who the fuck are you? Who do you work for?
I work for the government.

## Yeah?
Bullshit.

## What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
The bonus on the contract for you was one million dollars.

## Now what?
Turn off the engine.

## You want me to pump?
No, stay in the car. I want you to understand something. If I intended to kill you, you would already be dead.

## Okay. How did you find me?
You're the computer hacker, you tell me.

## Nikita?
Yellow Pages. V for veterinarian. There aren't that many.

## An assassin?
Until a minute ago.

## What does that mean?
If I still was what I used to be, you would not be pointing that at me.

## Who is that other guy?
Another contractor.

## Someone hired both of you?
No. They hired Bain. The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one.

## So this is something between you and him?
He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him.

## Why?
Because he is trying to retire me.

## He wants to kill you?
Yes.

## Why?
The nature of the business. You remove your competition.

## And you want to use me to get him?
Yes.

## Why?
Because he took a contract on you. He'll come for you and he'll find you.

## How?
Oh Jesus Jesus...

## Just Electra?
Yeah.

## As in daughter of Agamemnon?
No. Just Electra.

## If Bain hadn't taken the contract on me, would you have?
No.

## Why?
Because I'm done.

## This is crazy. I can't trust you. You can't trust me. How can we possibly help each other?
With computers.

## It's not the same, is it?
Better than playing with yourself.

## Had?
It looks like white's game.

## Why didn't you finish this game?
He was... taken.

## Why?
Because that's how it works. That's what it's about. He was the best. He was on top.

## How did you get into the business?
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.

## The C.I.A.?
More or less.

## How old were you?
They recruited me when I was in high school.

## Jesus -- why?
Languages. I was already fluent in nine languages.

## You were like a boy genius?
Some people said that. I never thought so.

## Why not?
I was just different.

## You went from high school to the Agency?
No. I graduated from George Washington University. Then I entered the Agency training program.

## They didn't give you a choice, did they?
No, they didn't.

## But you knew what they were training you for?
Of course. I was going to be James Bond.

## Why not?
Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.

## Why?
Because you are a women.

## They tried to kill you?
Yes. It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared.

## Then you went freelance?
Tell me about the first time.

## My first take?
Yes.

## Why?
Because I want to know.

## Are they usually like that?
No. Just the first one.

## After that?
They become complicated... messy.

## Did it ever bother James Bond?
Is that what you wanted to hear? Something cold blooded... something remorseless...

## Do you have a passport?
Several.

## Where is it?
Mexico.

## Hey, where are you?
Thinking.

## About?
Nothing.

## I've never been to the Gulf of Mexico. Is it as nice as they say?
I don't know.

## You were there?
That's where he'll be.

## What?
I wasn't expecting this. I need to think.

## Why not?
It helps me to focus. It centers me, helps me think.

## Oh. What do you think about?
Work. The things I need to get done.

## Do you think about the game?
Yes.

## Not even a stalemate?
No.

## What will you do if this works, if we get the money?
I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been.

## Here?
In Costa Blanca.

## What do you think he's doing?
I don't know... But I'm sure he's not sleeping.

## Really?
He won't be looking for you. Just be careful. Buy a book. Keep your sunglasses on.

## How was the beach?
The beach? It was nice.

## Where did you learn it?
Taiwan.

## Two way?
Transmits and receives.

## Okay. Then what?
Then, we wait.

## What? What if he brings it with him?
He can't. The bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and X-ray machines.

## We split the money?
Yes.

## What is it? I don't like this at all. What is going on here?
I don't know. It just happened. I was here ten years ago, I'm here now. That's it.

## What happened?
I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank. He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.

## What did he want?
He wanted what I want now; to get out of the business. To disappear to some empty Greek island.

## What did he say?
He said I couldn't win. That no one wins at this game.

## Was that it?
Then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business.

## Do you have ulcers?
No.

## Why did you trade a bishop for a knight?
I hate bishops. They're useless. I like knights.

## Did you think they were newlyweds?
I didn't notice them.

## How do you know they're not?
I went into their room this afternoon.

## What?
It was no big deal. I saw them leave, I went in.

## Why in the hell would you take that chance?
I heard them last night and it made me want to know something about them. I wanted to, so I did.

## No?
It's always been that way. The world has always functioned on two levels.

## Why?
I don't know. When I was in college, I was forced to go to a psychiatrist because I was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor.

## And you were drilling these holes...?
So I could watch the girl that lived under me.

## What?
That's a ridiculous move.

## Why?
Because, I'll take it.

## Can I ask you something?
I'm sure you will.

## Am I attractive?
Yes.

## Are you attracted to me?
Yes.

## Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?
Both.

## Is that why you didn't want to talk about women before?
I didn't want to complicate the situation.

## Attraction is a complication?
It can be.

## It happened to you before?
Yes.

## Who was she?
Someone like me, like you. A pro.

## What happened to her?
She was taken.

## Was she the only one?
After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated.

## Is this becoming complicated?
I'm not sure that I care anymore.

## Were you attracted to me right away?
No.

## Honestly?
Uh-huh.

## Why?
That doesn't sound normal.

## What?
I waited another four minutes.

## Jesus! Why didn't you tell me?
I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.

## Would you like a drink?
I'd love one. Whatever you're having.

## Why are you working today?
Holidays are our busiest days. No one likes to be alone on holidays. I know I don't.

## You're very good at this aren't you?
I think you're supposed to answer that question.

## For what?
Honesty.

## Do you ever regret things you've done?
Everyone regrets something.

## But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?
Sometimes.

## Do you think about their wives or their families?
No. They call me, I don't call them. If they didn't call I wouldn't exist.

## Do you ever think about starting over?
All the time.

## Can you tell me about it?
Then, I'll sail alone.

## Is that all you want?
Yes.

## How much farther?
Just a little ways. Up to those trees.

## Why not?
I don't know. Part of me wanted to but part of me always said, 'What's she going to be able to do?' I don't know. Maybe I didn't trust her.

## You're pretty famous aren't you?
I hope not.

## One hundred thousand? That's it? Jesus... Is that a lot?
Average.

## That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
Right.

## What are you thinking about?
And an R.C.

## Can I ask you something?
Go ahead.

## What do other guys do?
Everyone handles it differently. Some are ready, some are not.

## Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?
Some.

## Can I ask you a question?
Anything.

## You mean quit?
Yeah.

## Look at that. I haven't watched the sun set in a million years. Do you mind?
No.

## You wish to close this account today?
That's correct.

## How would you like the funds?
American currency.

## I'm sorry, but I am waiting for an associate. Can you hold everything for me until he arrives?
Of course, senor.

## Naz dravi!.....What do you like about this place, these people, Chris?
I don't know. It's kind of underground. Doug's right, there's too much crap in this town.

## So how's your work?
It's okay, they're training me on the cash register and after I hope to work on one of the jewellery counters.

## Sounds cool.....Do you think he's serious about squatting a place?
Well, he sure seems fired up all of a sudden.

## It won't last, believe me. And you, when will you go back to the States?
I don't know, maybe I'll enrol for postgrad' studies next Autumn.

## Like you?
No, better than me. You know, I have many friends, you should meet more of them.

## No you don't get it. Every cabby in town knows this joint. So where's the mystery, the danger?
Inspirations a fickle thing, you don't realise you had it till it's gone.

## You're outnumbered Kat two to one, got to go with the majority, that's democracy.
You guys having a go a me or what?

## What about that squat bar you showed me, is that open on a Sunday?
Yeah, let's check out the low-life.

## Anything in it?
No, just crap. I want some picture frames.

## Never heard of K-MART?
I don't have the money for those Bourgeois traps. Hell, I'm making what a Czech earns.

## Who's your friend?
Fifteen crowns.

## I ain't sure poetry will go down too well here.
Oh yeah, what's that?

## No, it's the whole idea behind it. How did they get this place?
Squatted it.

## So? DOUG Well, there's tons of empty buildings - why don't we get one?
What we need is a space for real performance art. A cultural exchange for radical expressionism.

## You've got to stop using that word \"we\" it's getting kind of scary. Right Katka?
He's not drunk, he's crazy.

## Like Custer huh?
These guys think the West is just MTV and Hollywood movies. We've got to show them there's more to it.

## Care to elaborate?
Amazing, he didn't even say \"if\".

## No \"if's\" or \"but's\" it's a cinch. Do you want to know what the icing is?
Okay, we're listening. But I'm with Katka on this one.

## It's big, right Jahn?
Okay, it's in here somewhere. Let's keep it quiet.

## You were right Jahn, it's a great space..... Hey, Chris. Do you want to come and look?
You got my word on it.

## He was an electrician?
No, he was talking about girls, I think.

## Don't worry, I'll give you a hand as soon as I can.
Too right....Now the other thing we've got to do is start clearing up the rubble. Can you make a start on that?

## Just two things. What do I use to shift the stuff and where in hell am I gonna put it all?
Scout around and see if there's something, check that other corridor. If there's nothing, nip out and buy a broom and shovel.

## And put it on expenses?
Sure....As for the crap, I've got an idea.

## So?
You sure got a handle on that word \"we\".

## A locksmith too? Why d'you ever bother with writing?
I'm making history Chris, nothings going to stop me. There could be a knighthood for us in this, once President Havel hears.

## And if the police stop by - what do I tell them?
No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.

## No, why?
cause you stink of booze.

## I'm an idiot?
Nope, not even close. I've thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though.

## Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?
None, it's mine - you said it earlier, I'm nuts.

## Can you do the lock on it?
No, it's welded up!....Let's take a look from the inside.

## But how did the wall get here?
I don't know. This wall isn't like the rest though, it's not all that old either.

## And suppose a little old lady lives there?
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.

## I'll rig up something don't worry - Do you think I could bash through with that little hammer?
I don't know Doug, we haven't even got the place together and already you want to extend it.

## Need any disks?
Yeah, I'll take some.

## Yeah, her name's Kavlova, why?
See if she can donate some paintings or something to hang on these walls, give it a bit of atmosphere.

## Moved on to plumbing huh?
We got a party tomorrow night. Can't have the place smelling like shit.

## I thought you were gonna throw these?
I had a better idea, we'll burn them. There's a drum across the road; I was just waiting for the workers to go home.

## Have you ever stolen anything?
Nope.

## Like helping a sick kid?
No, for the Asylum.

## Am I late?
No, not if you've got better things to do.

## Fancy some lunch after we_re through with this Meccano shit?
Sure, I think it_s your turn to buy too.

## No beer?
Not on the opening night, wouldn't look right.

## Red or white?
Both, see you later.

## Have you cleared all the rubble up?
No, not yet.

## What?
Thanks. Come on Chris, give me a hand.

## My God! What happened?
I fell in love.

## And a tram hit you?
No, the boyfriend.

## What happened to Katka?
Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.

## Couldn't keep your hands off the hired help, huh?
It just happened.

## She's as American as apple pie too. Have you figured out exactly what it is you despise about them?
She's cool.

## What are you on about?
Well, I take it you're going to drag her down to your minimal existence and adjust her mindset.

## Yeah and I got the bruises to prove it. So what?
Nothing, it's just that's when things usually start to go wrong.

## What?
Take the drill back to Honza at the office, I promised to get it back for the weekend and I don't want to show my face there.

## Hey Jahn.....You got a name for this thing?
It's me you want, I'm responsible for all this.

## Tell me some bad news?
I don't want to ruin your day.

## That bad?
Your too good for this town, Buddy.

## Huh?
I had a visit from the British Embassy. They think I'm a stray soccer hooligan.

## They're good guys..... Have you seen Holly?
Yeah. I tell you, they're one big happy family over there.

## What happened?
I don't know, I'm waiting for the transcript.

## So?
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.

## Did you see anything in the files?
It was all in Czech wasn't it.

## Yeah, somewhere?
Suppose those contained all the file info too? You could have a third or so of it there.

## Do you want me to see what's on them?
No point, it'll be in Czech and God knows what format. But if I'm right, they could be my ticket out of here.

## What do you want me to do?
Yeah, Dave Walters.

## Good, what's his number?
It's...42 56 76 .

## Sure....Anything else I can do for you?
God, I think I need a holiday.

## Time for lunch I think. I'll get the sandwiches. What would you like Holly?
I'm not hungry, really.

## We ain't going to give it away this time, are we?
I can't go with him.

## What?
It was a condition of getting Doug out.

## What are you talking about?
In return for Doug's freedom, I was never to see him again, I had to - it was his only chance.

## Well, he should be on his way back to his apartment by now.
You mean, Josh's father had nothing to do with it?

## Do you know the way?
Sure, it's on the red metro line you....

## No, by road?
Yeah, pretty well.

## There shooting at something.
That one?

## I'm just here to record some details, standard stuff.
Doug?

## You mean your NOT going to spring me?
So am I.

## Now - Your name is Douglas Greenwell, yes?
Yes.

## No!
They didn't look like medical files to me.

## Before you go, did you get those bruises here?
Sure, they wanted to know if I ever voted Conservative.

## Hey, Lawrence how are you doing mate?
Doug, haven't seen you for a while.

## I could pencil you in if you like?
I'll take a rain-check for now.

## Turned Czech huh?
Yeah, maybe.

## Why don't you read something after the break? DOUG What here? Weren't you listening to what I just said?
You used to read.

## So what's it going to be, Coogan's or U Vayvudoo?
Doug I can't, I've got to be at work by eight. You promised to take me home.

## So, we won't be going to London?
No, not just yet.

## I hope you're going to invite me in?
Fernet and tonic.

## That's it, I am just stupid teenager, yes?
Right now, yeah - you're talking crap.

## No Kat, I lied to you, I hate England and I don't ever want to live there again.
Will it help to get you out?

## I don't understand, it's your home?
There's nothing there for me.

## Interesting. Do reckon I could fit through here?
Sure, I've done it easily.

## Hi, want to take up dancing?
Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.

## So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
Sure, they are students.

## Can we charge admission?
Donations only! And make the thing non-lingual, so everyone gets a handle on it.

## Great. And your all set for the performance?
Yeah, it's a simple piece. If they get the floor done in time, me and the others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon, but it's not critical.

## Great....How long will it go for?
About forty minutes.

## Yeah, great....Dobchay! It will dry, yes?
Yes, of course...maybe one hour.

## How?
I'm in close with these guys, it isn't easy, but slowly they're opening up to me. Give me a month and I'll blow their movement wide open.

## A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
I don't know - maybe they are talking about it now. Mr Vitovetch is a good friend of the Judge.

## Will this thing take long?
No, it should be over soon.

## You mean it's started?
Of course, you can see that lady over there, she is recording everything.

## How do I know what's being said?
I will tell you - within a week I will have the transcript and we can go through it.

## Am I invited?
Sure as long as you don't bring that prick Josh. Thanks Lawrence.

## Why are you doing all this, what for?
Well, I've failed at everything else I've done and I can't hack it as a journalist, even for the Bugler.

## What's the Bugler?
It's a student magazine networked through Eastern Europe and funded by Republican do-gooders back in the States.

## I figured you more as a Socialist?
I moving more to Communism now it's dying out.

## A champion of lost causes huh?
No, I'm just running scared, same as everyone else.

## Shall I wash these out?
Yeah, we'd better keep them for now, I'll try and get some glasses for tomorrow night.

## Is it dry?
Yeah seems okay.

## What would you like, beer?
No, just a coffee.

## Who you saving the dishes for?
Guests.

## Don't you have a girlfriend?
Sometimes.

## Run into Josh?
Yeah, but it was okay.

## How did he look?
Better than you.

## Where did you steal the car?
It's Josh's.

## This is your doing?
Yes, they had nothing to do with it.

## And you broke into that room?
It was the biggest I could find.

## What was the real purpose behind this venture?
A kind of freedom.

## I didn't get to see what's on the disks but I can guess. Do you want to hear my terms or not.
Enjoying our hospitality?

## The choice is yours, it's not negotiable.
What is it you want?

## And the students?
I have the Director's word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.

## You have the letter and my word, if you wish you may wait upstairs....Now, where are the disks?
I'll need to make a phone call.

## I insist, it is the least we can do.
Would you like your things now?

## Hey Doug, where you been?
Working....Under cover.

## Nothing. I've got to put up some kitchen shelves that's all. You've got one haven't you?
Yeah.

## Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.

## No problem, is it at your place?
Yeah.

## So, he didn't fire you?
No way, he even gave me back pay.

## When the hell did you write that?
Just yesterday.

## Yeah, so I hear. Don't you think you should go get changed?
Later.

## What for?
Well, for a start, you've got to get cleaned up.

## Why?
I don't want to go.

## Will you come home and forget all about him?
Yes, if you can get him free.

## Why are there still such headlines?
This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.

## You know everyone can be controlled Pavel. Where are you storing the personnel files?
In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.

## You are quite sure it's secure?
The files are in a sealed room and the University are under strict orders to stay away.

## You are responsible...What has happened?
We're not sure...

## The University cannot do this. Is the room safe?
Yes, I think so, it is still barred, but it is not the University who are in the building.

## Have you lost all control of this city?
I don't understand it, there were a lot of people there last night, many Americans, I believe we should move carefully.

## And what of these foreigners?
I don't care about Americans. Arrest them all if you have to, but keep those records secret.

## And there has been enquiries from the American Embassy maybe they are involved?
All the more reason to eliminate him.

## What if his accomplices have made copies?
It was all on a Russian format, I don't think that would be so easy; we must take that chance.

## She asleep?
I'll tell her you were here.

## What if they expel you?
Kelly wouldn't do that.

## Why not?
Cuz nothing happened at school.

## Bout what?
About a job.

## Out with Belinda?
That's over. Way over.

## You saw him?
We talked. He wanted to get a bite -- after. I said no.

## You going to let him? You going to reward him by being the son he was never man enough to be a father to?
You look nice. I should have dressed.

## To see your father?
No. I won't be long.

## Were you with Jamie?
Yeah.

## You sleeping with her?
Be yourself and I don't think there is a wrong thing. Let Jamie take the lead. She'll let you know what she needs.

## What are you doing here?
He wants to talk to you.

## What kind of a man are you, son?
Get yourself a glass.

## Were?
You don't know me.

## -- I wear the sweater because I'm cold. I read because no one talks to me. My hair is my hair. What is it exactly that's bothering you?
You mean care what you say? I'm worrying about other things.

## Can't you have a normal conversation?
I don't want to have any conversation.

## This play -- ?
-- I know you don't suck at acting.

## Because that's where the fire is?
28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.

## I'm an enemy?
Kinda. Yeah.

## Are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know?
Maybe a little of both.

## So what else is on this list?
It's private.

## Because I try to be nice to people?
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.

## Do you think I'm strange?
Cuz it's dark and quiet and you can see into another world.

## The world of the dead?
Could be...

## What is that?
That is my telescope.

## Looking for intelligent life?
Looking for something -- someone.

## Do you believe you'll see your mother again?
I hope so. I think maybe she sees me now.

## In ten words or less?
Yeah.

## Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
No.

## You don't believe in anything?
The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.

## Yes. And?
Oh. Just not at school...

## He okay?
Healthy as can be.

## And that would ruin your reputation how?
Because then you couldn't hide behind your books and your telescope and your sweater and your God.

## So you're talking to me?
When I have something to say.

## No. But are you -- impressed?
Like fire.

## What?
You.

## Why not?
I'm not allowed to date.

## Is there a rush?
I have to get you home by one.

## We're doing something -- ?
Before we do this, I just want to say that a good life's gotta be about more than achieving stuff -- like on your list.

## Excuse me?
Fun.

## That what's happening to you, only faster?
Stand right here.

## Where?
You're acting like a crazy person.

## You're sometimes not sure?
I'm sure. Pretty sure.

## What do you actually know with religion?
Wonder. Beauty. Joy. Love.

## Loved?
That. And less strange.

## Assholes. This happen to you?
Twice a year.

## What's wr--?
The Challenger exploded. Principal Kelly's about to make an announcement.

## Where?
Away from here.

## How do you know this place?
Before the divorce. My father used to take me here. Fire spotting was his summer job.

## What would you do up here?
Look. Talk. Not talk.

## What'd you tell your father?
The truth. I just left you out of it.

## When did you build this?
I was twelve.

## So what do you want to see?
Mars.

## What about your father?
I'm always home by midnight and he's always asleep.

## What's the best thing I can see tonight?
Me.

## Can you locate XXI5639I?
Sure.

## Care, but just don't let it get to you. It gives them power.
Here. Why am I looking at this star?

## That what you do?
Yes. I try to keep my power.

## You're going to take a year off? Join the Peace Corps -- ?
No.

## What are you going to -- ?
Pull over.

## Then I'll take you home. You'll feel better tomorrow.
Where? Why?

## Why didn't you tell me?
The doctors said to do everything the same as long as possible. I didn't want anyone being -- weird around me.

## Are you frightened?
All the time. I feel like I have no one.

## Help me live until I die?
I will.

## What are you thinking?
That I want you to take me home.

## You know how to waltz?
I was going to fake it.

## How you doing?
Tired.

## How're you doing?
Better. I was really angry.

## Because you have hope that you'll get better?
No. Maybe I believe God has a bigger dream for me than I had for myself. Maybe I believe the journey, the big adventure, never ends...

## Can I -- go out?
You'll be fine for a few minutes.

## Will you do something for me?
Landon. I can't even do for myself.

## But if you could, you would?
I don't want you to see him outside school activities.

## Up to?
I thought we had rid ourselves of his disagreeable companionship.

## Did you give him a gift?
No.

## You're in the play?
Lead man.

## Does it have to do with Jamie?
Yes, sir.

## Like what, sir?
You decide.

## How about your family?
Since I was five. My mom's a cocktail waitress.

## Materially or spiritually?
Either. Both.

## How -- how long does she have?
Her doctors have. Jamie and I. We're still praying for a miracle.

## I've almost finished the rocker. Did she order mirrors?
In there.

## You have materials for the side bearings?
I'm using an old phonographic turntable.

## You know about this stuff?
I helped Jamie with the first one.

## Yes. You?
Getting by.

## Finding the real world to your liking, Mr. Carter?
Please.

## I'd work backstage or something?
Or something. They're doing a play for the holidays.

## When do I get time for me?
You don't. That's the point.

## Where did you get -- ?
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.

## You came here to give me my report card?
I've seen students with records like yours go to J.C. for a couple of years, then transfer to a good college.

## Am I at the same angle to you and the basket as before?
Yeah.

## A similar triangle?
What else? What kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths.

## Scalene?
Okay. Make me an isosceles.

## What do you want, Biff?
Show me some respect, you little asshole. It's Special Officer Tannen to you.

## This is 1952....?
Uh, yes, sir...

## And you never heard of rock 'n roll?
No....

## Marty. What's for breakfast?
Gimme some chili, fries, and a Tab.

## Dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter?
Third time they've been out there this week.

## How was school today?
Fine.

## Learn anything?
Oh yeah.

## How old are you?
Seventeen.

## Have we ever met before?
Hi, Marty.

## You remember me...?
How could I forget? Oh, sure, I remember you.

## What time does school start around here?
Nine o' clock. Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.

## You mean like how you're supposed to act with someone on a first date?
I think I know exactly what you mean.

## By the way, that reminds me... Saturday night we're taking Grandma Stella out for Chinese food.
You do?

## Eileen, Chinese food again?
George, if you don't want Chinese food, pick a place you want to go and make a reservation.

## Uh, hi, Eileen.
Is that what you were going to ask me, George? To go to the dance?

## What drill?
The drill! The power drill I bought you for Christmas. I was using it last night.

## Learn anything?
Oh yeah.

## Not now....
The sunrise? What for?

## And where am I gonna be?
Maybe if I used my left....

## Yes, that's my name. Who are you, young man? Are you supposed to be here?
Uh -- yeah. I'm new here, and I'm supposed to be in this class.

## You have a name?
Marty. Marty Lewis.

## Who, me?
You're the only Mr. Lewis in this class. If you have something to say, say it so the whole class can hear.

## Run out of gas?
Operator...

## Local calls cost five cents. What number do you want?
Oh -- right! Uh, Madison 3489.

## Operator, what's today's date?
March 11th.

## REESE Been any place unusual in the past twelve hours?
Home, school, here...

## BROWN Did you ever consider that some doors are locked for a reason?
Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to be opened. See you after school.

## BROWN Oh -- Marty -- what time did you say it was?
Eight thirty.

## BROWN A gold mine?
Sure! Listen -- we take the racing results from today's paper...

## Well, there's a mall here now -- I mean, there will be.
Professor? Professor Brown?

## You didn't, Professor. It was an accident! You see, what happened --
BROWN A mall?

## BROWN Pardon me?
Oh. That expression probably hasn't been invented yet... I can get behind -- I agree with you.

## BROWN Of course! The power converter! It works! Of course, it works... What chemicals do we use?
Well, Professor, are you sure you want me to tell you? You know, changing the course of history and all....

## How did you know?
Okay, Professor, I get where you're coming from. The way I look, the way I'm dressed... I'd stick out like a sore thumb.

## Professor, be serious, would you?
You're talking crazy! An atomic blast would melt me and the time machine in a matter of seconds!

## BROWN Say, where did this guitar come from?
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.

## BROWN Where did you get this?
I brought it with me from 1982. It's from my science book.

## Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?
BROWN In a manner of speaking, yes. And because of that, she's no longer interested in your father.

## That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
That's just what I needed to hear.

## Professor, if something does go wrong tonight... if I don't get my parents back together... when do you think I'd cease to exist?
BROWN There's no way of knowing.

## Professor -- there are some doors that shouldn't be opened, Marty said softly, without turning around.
BROWN You didn't?

## BROWN Hop in, Marty, . We've got a long drive ahead of us.
What year is this?

## What do you call this?
BROWN A car.

## But if you didn't rebuild the time machine, how did I go back in time in the first place?
Obviously!

## What theater was I at?
BROWN The Orpheum.

## It's the most beautiful city I've ever seen! What is it?
Uh, yeah... Gimme a Tab.

## What?
A Tab.

## Dick? Dick who?
Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.

## Hi. where's Cato?
Well, he's gone.

## Gone?... Where?
He said not to tell.

## Yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town. You're the ones with the Studebaker, aren't you?
No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you.

## What's going on?
Can't afford to take chances.

## You promise to stay down there for an hour?
Yeah.

## How you doing, Cato?
Not bad.

## What you been doing?
Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of.

## Where'd you get them antlers?
They come with the house.

## That's what he told you, huh?
No, he showed me one.

## Don't you ever get bored around here?
Sometimes. The other day, though, an old boy was plowing in the field over there, found some old Spanish coins.

## What'd they look like?
Kind of round, like so... Gold. I'll show you if you want.

## That your spider in there? In that bottle?
Yeah.

## What do you feed him?
Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.

## Does he bite?
He never bit me.

## You ever held another job before?
I used to throw trash for the City.

## You lost that one?
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.

## What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
I can't think of anything at the moment... I'd like you to write me out a slip, though, proving I came down here.

## Oh yeah?
Long as my ammo held out... Right there's where you caught me.

## Say, what kind of rifle was that you were shooting at me?
Thirty aught six.

## You ever had to open it up like that before?
Nope.

## You like people?
They're okay.

## Then why'd you do it?
I don't know. Always wanted to be a criminal, I guess. Just not this big a one... Takes all kinds though.

## Hey, listen, Tom, I don't mean to tell you how to run your show here but these cuffs are pinching. What do you say now?
I need to get your signature on some papers here, Kit.

## Well, I've got to read them first. Suppose I could get a Coke while I do?
Sure thing. Come on.

## What'd you come out here for?
I wasn't aware there was any law against it.

## Is that right?
Yeah.

## What're you doing?
I've got a gun here, sir. It's always a good idea to have one around.

## What for?
For coming onto my property... With a gun.

## Yeah? Why not?
Cause I can't allow it.

## What's going to happen to Jack and me?
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.

## What's your friend's name?
Jack.

## You love him?
I don't know.

## Hi, I'm Kit. I'm not keeping you from anything important, am I?
No.

## Oh, incidentally, my last name is Carruthers. Sounds a little too much like \"druthers\", doesn't it?
It's okay.

## You still in school?
Nah, I got me a job.

## Doing what?
Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay.

## Hey, wait a minute. When am I going to see you again?
Well, I know what my daddy's going to say.

## Can I be honest?
Sure.

## He'll say that?
Yeah.

## Now what's he know about garbage, huh?
Nothing.

## Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing?
Spanish.

## How do you say \"Quit my Job\" in Spanish?
Something mi trabajo.

## Yeah, well, I'm going to work as a cowboy now... Or thinking about it. It's a routine, like anything. What do you think?
I don't know.

## You want to go for a ride?
Well, I got homework.

## Anybody ever call you \"Red\"?
Yeah, but I don't like it.

## Why not?
Just don't... I've got a headache.

## Can I come around and see you tomorrow?
Okay.

## There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?
No.

## Did it go the way it 'uz supposed to?
Yeah.

## Is that all there is to it?
Yeah.

## Gosh, what was everybody talking about?
Don't ask me.

## What?
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.

## How bad off is he?
I can look and see.

## Are you sure?
You don't believe me, see for yourself.

## Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?
Wouldn't be funny... Listen, I'll be back in a while.

## How you doing?
I'm fine. Kind of tired.

## How's he doing?
I got him in the stomach.

## Is he upset?
He didn't say anything to me about it.

## Think I got 'em?
I don't know.

## What'd you put him in there for?
Just to keep him out of the sun.

## You tired?
Yeah.

## Well, why you always walking behind me?
Don't.

## Anybody ever done that to you before?
No.

## Positive?
Yes.

## Never mind. It doesn't matter... If I'm worth a damn, I'll pick the right direction. And if I'm not, well, I don't care. See what I mean?
No.

## What?
Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.

## You smoke Pall Mall?
Yeah.

## Have you got a better idea?
I just don't want to go.

## What?
Course it's too bad about your dad.

## Hi... ah, Mister Scarborough here?
Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.

## Really?
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.

## What's that?
Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.

## This your place?
Yes.

## Sorry to barge in on you. Anybody else here besides you two?
No.

## Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?
Stay as long as you like.

## Hi, whatcha doing?
Just thinking.

## Good a way to kill time as any... She okay?
Yes.

## Listen, ah... We're going to take the Cadillac for a while. How'd that be?
Fine.

## You're my friend, aren't you?
Yes.

## Morning... Say, you got any gas?
Maybe.

## Just a second now. That's your truck. isn't it?
You didn't walk out here.

## Who are you?
Name is Carruthers. Believe I shoot people every now and then. Not that I deserve a medal.

## Think I'll take the juice?
Beats me.

## Wanta sue me?
All these people applied for drivers' licenses in the same town in New Jersey on the exact same date.

## New Jersey?
Then that's it!

## You wanna take the chance, Casper?
Not me. No way.

## The creatures? They attacked you? They tried to possess you?
Smells fermented. Check in with the Institute, Reno, see if everything's kosher.

## What?
I'm a giant semi-conductor, and there's alien creatures all around us. Form the Eighth Dimension, I think. Look...

## Ever since that phony phone call from the President. Look at this. What is it?
It's your hand, Buckaroo.

## Antidote to what? Whose disguises?
Arachtoids. From Planet Ten.

## Got a half a tuna sandwich.
Planet 10?

## Then what?
Vanished. Thin air.

## Have you warned Professor Hikita?
I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.

## You okay?
Yeah. Just grazed me. The Professor's under the floor too...with the Overthruster...

## Apache?
Arachtoid.

## Buckaroo, you got a minute--?
Not really. This is pretty important.

## Everybody ready? How do we look? Do we look okay?
I look great. Let's rock 'n' roll.

## Hey, any lock can be picked. So what's he up to?
I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.

## Planet 10? The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy? The invisible body?
Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...

## What is it, Tommy?
It's Whorfin, Buckaroo. Line 3.

## All accounted for? Where's Penny?
New Jersey brought her back to the bus through heavy fire. Quite a guy if you want my opinion.

## What is this thing? A fighter?
Boy, I hope so, Buckaroo Banzai.

## Where're you goin'?
To get my guns.

## Raise your hand...where?
This is so embarrassing...

## Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that? And a spotlight. What's your name?
Penny. I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.

## Did you say...\"Peggy\"?
My name is Penny. Penny Priddy. There I've said it, but it won't mean anything to you. I'm a nobody.

## He offered you money?
This song's for Peggy. And all you others out there a little down on your luck.

## My name's, Penny! But who cares?
Let me go, let me go, you creeps...

## What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that?
I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.

## Who were you really trying to kill last night?
You. Like the papers all say.

## Who?
The girl I remind you of.

## Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?
No. Laramie. Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that? Oh, right, sure, I forgot, you know everything.

## Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you?
Which? The one in my throat.

## Did you have family there--? A sister? In Cody?
I don't know. I always felt like I did, like there was another me...

## Another 'you'?
Somewhere. See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby. I was adopted.

## Go where? Where're you going?
Please, Penny. You just gotta trust me now. Okay? And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right.

## What? If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.

## Believe in Penny Priddy?
World Watch One. Direct incoming transmission.

## That which does not kill us makes us stronger, Buckaroo. What's it like out there in the real world?
You're gonna have to repeat that, I think, Buckaroo.

## A what?
You're quite serious about this, aren't you, Buckaroo. We know each other pretty well, I think.

## Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back?
MAN No, sir. I think the flint...

## What's happening with my call to SAC?
MAN Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command. They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.

## How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?
Nigh on ten years. Been through a lotta scrapes together.

## What'd you do before? Can I ask?
Government work. Had my own think tank. Got tired of thinking-wanted some action. Seen plenty of it too. So will you if you stick around.

## Where's Buckaroo? Is he alive?
Course he's alive. He's Buckaroo Banzai.

## Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women. Can you play that thing?
Better than him.

## Why me?
Pick those up, Reno.

## Doctor Lizardo. Wasn't he on TV once?
You're thinking of Mr. Wizard. This guy's an eccentric genius.

## Where do you hail from, Doc?
Reno, how's about you take New Jersey's gear, mosey on over to the bus and introduce him to the rest of the hands.

## Why me?
Cause Buckaroo needs me here.

## Asshole probably got lost.
Any sign of Buckaroo?

## Unscheduled surgery. He'll be waltzing along momentarily. What're you doing tonight?
Flying to Cambodia.

## Now twenty seconds downrange...Perfect Tommy, how on earth is Buckaroo able to keep that thing on the ground?
She's just a damn road hugger, Allison. Plus the man can drive.

## Is, uh... Is he okay?
He will be... When he can't write, he drinks.

## I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
Yes I am. I'm working on a wres  please call me Barton.

## Hello.
What. What don't I understand?

## ...Who is this?
Barton. I'm sorry, it's Barton Fink.

## No, but the whole goddamn  Audrey? Have you ever had to read any of Bill's wrestling scenarios?
Yes, I'm afraid I have.

## Well... THIS.
What are they like? What are they about?

## Before what?
Before Bill came to Hollywood.

## Oh yeah? What kind of write?
...Once or twice. His name is Charlie Meadows.

## So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
Nothing, really. Said he was in the insurance business.

## What else?
He... I'm trying to think... Nothing, really... He... He said he liked Jack Oakie pictures.

## W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
Just Bill, please.

## ...A little social lubricant, Mistuh Fink?
It's still a little early for me.

## ...Still, I must say. I haven't felt peace like this since the grand productive days. Don't you find it so, Barton? Ain't writin' peace?
Well... actually, no Bill...

## And what would that be, son?
No son, thisahere moonshine's got nothin' to do with shuttin' folks out. No, I'm usin' it to build somethin'.

## What's that?
I'm buildin' a levee. Gulp by gulp, brick by brick. Raisin' up a levee to keep that ragin' river of manure from lappin' at m'door.

## I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're producing this Wallace Beery picture I'm working on.
Are you all right?

## Then who should I talk to?
...Look, you're confused? You need guidance? Talk to another writer.

## Wuddya got for me  what the hell happened to your face?
Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.

## Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos breed in swamps  this is a desert town. Wuddya got for me?
Well I...

## Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't read. You gotta TELL it to him-tell him SOMEthing for Chrissake.
On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got?

## Well what do I tell him?
I thought you were going to join us. Jesus, Garland, you left me alone with those people.

## What do you do far a living?
I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.

## No, what did it say?
Take my copy. You're the toast of Broadway and you have the opportunity to redeem that for a little cash  strike that, a lot of cash.

## Barton? What time is it? Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine, Garland  I have to talk to you. I'm calling long distance.

## ...What is it Barton? Are you okay?
I'm fine, garland, but I have to talk with you.

## What do you mean, Barton?
Not big in the sense of large  although it's that too. I mean important. This may be the most IMPORTANT work I've done.

## That's all right, really, thank you.
Have you read the Bible, Garland?

## All right, hell, you trying to work and me carrying on in there. Look, the liquor's good, wuddya say?
Well, I'm a writer, actually.

## And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?
...In spite of what you might think from tonight, I'm pretty good at it.

## Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...
What kind of scribbler are you  newspaperman did you say?

## What do I write about?
Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, that's it, Bart.

## Seen a doctor?
Ah, doctors. What's he gonna tell me? Can't trade my head in for a new one.

## Thanks, I'd invite you over to my place, but it's a goddamn mess. You married, Bart?
Nope.

## ...All right now, when I say \"Ready... wrestle!\" you try and pin me, and I try and pin you. That's the whole game. Got it?
...Yeah, okay.

## Jesus, what a day I've had. Ever had one of those days?
Seems like nothing but, lately.

## How did you know about that?
Know about it? I can practically see how they're doin' it. Brother, I wish I had a piece of that.

## You're leaving?
In a few days. Out to your stompin' grounds as a matter of fact  New York City. Things have gotten all balled up at the Head Office.

## ...Your room does that too?
I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper.

## What do you mean?
This kind of heat. It's pathetic.

## ...Can I come in?
No!... I'm fine. Thank you.

## Charlie, I'm in trouble  something horrible's happened  I've gotta call the police...
Barton. Are you all right?

## Yeah.
...Will you stay with me till they get here?

## I believe you  I KNOW you. But why should the police?
Jesus... They can tell that...

## ...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?
She's dead, Barton! If that was her name.

## You'll be back?
I'm at the Earle.

## To be honest, I don't go to the pictures much, Mr. Lipnik
...Yes, thank you.

## Yeah... rye whiskey?
Boy! You writers! Work hard, play hard! That's what I hear, anyway...

## ...Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnik?
I  Mr. Lipnik

## F-I-N-K. Fink, Barton. That must be you, huh?
Must be.

## Transient or resident?
I don't know... I mean, I'll be here, uh, indefinitely.

## Well, I'm going to be working here, mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do you have room service?
The others are being sent.

## Jesus! Ain't that a load off! You live in 605?
Yeah.

## Charlie... Charlie's back...
Is this multiple choice?

## Got a couple questions to ask ya.
No kidding, bright boy  we smelt Mundt all over this. Was he the idea man?

## What do you do, Fink?
Big fuckin' deal.

## Would that be good enough for ya?
Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.

## Female caucasian, thirty years old. Nice tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description?
But, you know, with the head still on.

## Fink. That's a Jewish name, isn't it?
...I thought you said you were a writer.

## Give you nose bleeds?
Tell us where the heads are, maybe they'll go easy on you.

## Why's it so goddamn hot out here?
...Fred...

## How's about it, Bart?
...Thanks Lou. Join us. Join us. Talking about the Wallace Beery picture.

Bring 1976 up.

## I'm fine. Come on, Beth! You know I'm fine! How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?

## So -- how are things?
Things are fine. I told you. They're fine.

No! I'm working my tail off. I'm off the sauce, I'm not even smoking anymore.

I need a cigarette.

## Who's got access to my goddamn file?
Don't, Beth. Don't lie to me.

## Who?
Nilsen.

## How do you know Catherine Tramell saw my reports?
She knows stuff about me that only you know.

## What was she like in school?
I hardly knew her. She gave me the creeps, though. I don't know why.

## What is your problem? I'm trying to help you. Why won't you let me help you?
I don't need any help.

## What do you want, Nick?
Tell me about Catherine.

## What did she tell me, Beth?
I did dye my hair. It didn't have anything to do with her. I was a redhead for a while, too.

## Did you know Noah Goldstein?
I had him in two classes.

## Why did you change your name?
I got married. He was on staff at the clinic. I was down in Salinas. It didn't... last long.

Yes.

No. I wasn't in the mood to have sex with anyone last night.

## Are you arresting me?
If that's the way you want to play it.

## Do you always keep old newspapers around?
Only when they make interesting reading.

## Do you have a cigarette?
I don't smoke.

## I found some in my purse; would you like one?
I told you -- I quit.

## What's your new book about?
A detective. He falls for the wrong woman.

## Did I miss something?
I told them you wouldn't want an attorney present.

## You like playing games, don't you?
I've got a degree in psych. It goes with the turf. Games are fun.

## How did you feel when he died?
I loved him. I hurt.

## You still get the pleasure. Didn't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married, Nick?
Sure.

## Why not?
Because I'm a professional liar. I spend most of my waking hours dwelling on my lies. For my writing.

## How do you know all this stuff about me?
You know all about me.

## Am I... disturbing you?
No. Come in.

## You want a name from the present? How about Hazel Dobkins?
She wiped out her whole family.

## Didn't you study it in school?
Only in theory. You know all about homicidal impulse, don't you, shooter? Not in theory -- in practice.

You can make a mistake.

## Ice?
Please.

## What if I call you Nicky?
My wife used to call me that.

## What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately. You don't have any coke, do you? I love coke and Jack Daniel's.

## What's it about?
A boy kills his parents. They have a plane. He makes it look like an accident.

## Why does he do it?
To see if he can get away with it.

## You mean did I write it before my parents died?
Yes.

## You're not going to stop following me around now just because you're on leave -- are you?
No.

## Why take the risk?
To see if I can get away with it.

## How's your new book?
I'm getting deeper and deeper into my character.

## Did you think it was so special?
I told her it was the fuck of the century.

## What did you think?
I thought it was a pretty good beginning.

## Fine. How's your back?
It hurts.

## Are you kidding? You think this is my idea of morning-after conversation?
Do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets? I don't do those.

## Do you think I told her to kill You?
No.

## Do you think she killed Johnny Boz?
For what... to set me up? She loved me she wouldn't frame me.

## I paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file.
No?

## When?
About three months before I met you.

## Why?
I'd read about your shootings in the papers. I decided to write a book about a detective. I wanted to know my character.

## What about the other night. What about last night? Was that to get to know your character?
Maybe I'm losing interest in my book.

## Do you believe me?
I don't know.

## What did he say?
He asked if I had an icepick in me yet.

## Can I talk to you a minute?
Honey, why don't you go in the car? I'll be right there.

## I just thought I'd surprise you. What's the matter?
I found Lisa Henderson.

## Did you? What's she doing?
You're not going to tell me what she's doing. I thought we weren't playing games anymore.

## You still think I kill people, don't you?
No.

## How'd you get in here?
I decided to give you one more chance. I missed you.

## Did you miss me?
No.

## What are you researching?
I'm writing a book.

## What happens to them?
They fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after.

## Why not?
Somebody has to die.

## Why?
Somebody always does.

## How did it end?
I told you. She kills him.

## What is this -- some kind of... Joke? Are we playing games again?
The games are over. You were right. It was the fuck of the century, Shooter.

## What do we do now, Nick?
We fuck like minks. We raise rugrats. We live happily ever after.

## I'm John Corrigan. I'm an assistant district attorney, Ms. Tramell. Can we get you anything? Would you like some coffee?
No thank you.

## Would you tell us the nature of your relationship with Mr. Boz?
I had sex with him for about a year and a half. I liked having sex with him.

## Did you ever engage in sado- masochistic activity with him?
Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.

## Did you ever tie him up?
No.

## How did he die?
He was murdered.

## Really. Maybe that's why you're from Homicide. How?
I don't really feel like talking anymore.

## You workin' on another book?
Yes I am.

## How's that?
You make it up, but it has to be believable. They call it suspension of disbelief.

## Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
Sometimes.

## What kind of drugs?
Cocaine.

## That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?
I'm a writer, I use people for what I write. You write what you know. Let the world beware.

## What was the weapon?
.38 revolver. Never recovered.

## Were there ever any suspects?
No suspects, no motive. Unsolved.

## I had another one of you guys down here from Frisco -- about a year ago -- he asked me the same question. What's this about anyway?
Routine.

## Do you remember his name?
Nope, can't say that I do.

## Nilsen?
That's him.

## Was she ever a suspect?
Nope. There was some talk; it never panned.

## What kind of talk?
The usual -- a girlfriend.

## He had a girlfriend?
Nope. She did. Like I say. It never panned.

## Who was this fuckin' guy?
Rock and roll, Gus. Johnny Boz.

## Talcott doesn't usually show up at the office 'till after his 18 holes. What are they nervous about?
They're executives. They're nervous about everything.

## How'd it go, son?
She misses me.

## What you doin', son?
It's my first drink in three months. That okay with you, pop? She doesn't know me. I never saw her before Gus and I talked to her.

## Was she ever suspect?
No, sir. They never even got a statement from her.

## What's goin' down, son?
Nothin' I'll be okay, pop.

## What is it you got between you?
I don't know.

## Forgive me for askin', son, and I don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass?
She want to play? Fine. I can play.

## I'm not afraid of her.
You don't like punk rockers?

## Why the hell not?
I don't know. I'm just not.

## You all right, pop? You want me to drive you?
Come on, I'll drive you in this thing.

## You know that stuff they say about how you can judge people by their friends?
I don't believe it.

## Why not?
You're my friend, Gus.

## So Nilsen had a report on her -- so what. You don't know what the hell was in it?
Catherine told me what was in it.

## How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
He was I.A. He probably asked her about it.

## Where the hell you goin'?
I'm going with you.

## Were you with him last night?
You're looking for Catherine, not me.

## What was the motive?
She said she didn't know herself, just sort of did it on impulse. The razor just happened to be there.

## What was it?
Keep your three o'clock.

## Formerly engaged to Roberto Vasquez, deceased --
Are you kidding me?

## So what do we do -- nothing?
We bring her in for questioning.

## You sure?
I'm sure.

## Now what?
What now what? Now nothing. She passed the polygraph. That's it.

## How you're saying she killed her parents? Did she kill Bobby Vasquez, too?
Fuck you, Phil.

## I'll ask you once, Nick -- for the record did you kill him?
No.

## Beth? Now you've got Beth killing people?
Don't fuck with me, Nick. I don't need a reason to put your ass in a sling.

## You knew her, didn't you?
Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's house. All we did was write her name down.

## On what basis?
I'm Roxy. I'm her -- friend.

## How old was she when this happened?
Fourteen. We seal juvenile records until they're deceased. That's why you didn't find it in your computer.

## Did you check all four years?
Yes I did.

## Can you check again?
No Lisa Anderson, detective.

## Can there be some mistake?
Only if you're making it.

## No. Should I have?
I'm a painter, too.

## Is this finished yet?
I don't know.

## Not sure. How was yours?
I haven't decided yet. Rene, you wanna come over to the studio tomorrow. I wanna make a painting of you.

## What do you think?
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.

## Why, so you could humiliate me?
No, I wanted to make a painting of you.

## Of what?
The whole thing  painting.

## What about the shit they write?
I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.

## Ignorant art?
Yeah  I'd do that... You could teach me.

## What's wrong?
That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina.

## Do you still love her?
Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.

## What's with the wigs?
I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents.

## Piss painting?
I wanted to make a few more of these. Frank's been drinking this Mexican beer. It makes a good green.

## How come you're not peeing on them yourself?
I don't like beer.

## Who is it?
Annina Nosei.

## Is Jean Michel here?
No.

## How much for these five?
You should talk to him about this.

## I'd love to see some more of your work... Where's your studio?
You name it, I paint there.

## How about right now?
I don't know. I told you, this isn't my apartment.

## How do you know?
Just look at him. Little silver thingies on his cowboy boots? Honey, I don't think so.

## B.B. It's me  Jean! What's the matter? No snow in Switzerland this year?
I didn't see you.

## What do you mean?
You haven't heard? Andy's dead.

## Jean Michel... Crawling from the wreckage?
I need a dealer.

## What is it that gets you out of bed in the morning?
I hate this. Turn that off.

## Yes. What do they... stand for?
They're just words.

## Yes, I understand  but where do you take them from?
Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from? Everywhere.

## What are they?
Leeches. A long list of leeches. It looks good like that.

## I use a lot of colors  not only black.
You mean like an ape?

## What?
I'm not black.

## Not what?
Not black.

## Yes, yes... Let's talk about that.... your roots... Your father is from Haiti, isn't he?
Yup.

## Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?
Why, that's from Time Magazine.

## Would you like to see the wine list?
Chateau Latour '64, please.

## Really?
Yeah.

## Out?
Yeah... Maybe just his arms. Put some Cerulean Blue there.

##  In this corner?
Yeah..

## You want me to put it here?
Use your fucking instinct.

## It's Maria Portos. What should we do?
Why don't you try letting her in, Steve  I mean Shenge.

## What's wrong with you today?
Hey  Willie Mays.

## Who's that?
The Devil, man. Rene Ricard. Art critic  writes for Artforum. People read him. Tell him who you are..

## Who am I?
SAMO.

## You got a date already?
Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate.

## About what?
Your people.

## So then what?
What're you doing? You're doing something.

## You gonna carry that around all night?
Yeah... I'll paint on it.

## What's the rush, John Henry?
I ain't John Henry.

## What's your fuckin' problem, anyway?
I don't really have any problems.

## Good. What do you have?
What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.

## Can I walk you home?
I think I could do that alone.

## Party girls? Can I call you?
Yeah, if you have any dimes left. 477- 0496.

## I thought you hated this place?
I do. I just said that. I was never here before. I actually like it.

## Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing?
C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.

## I'm going to my parents this weekend. What am I going to wear? How could you do that to me?
... I'll buy you some new ones.

## Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?
You're back.

## Basquiat, what did you take?
Basquiat, don't lie. This is smack.

## You want some?
I hadn't thought about it.

## Think so?
... babies.

## What's wrong with me?
You're your own baby.

## What's that?
A present I picked up for you.

## Don't you think he's using you?
Why does everybody say that? He's the only person I know who doesn't need to use me.

## How is he?
Forget it.

## You don't have to be sorry. There's no one to blame. Jean, you're a real artist. I thought I was one. You made me realize I wasn't.
That is amazing. What year is it?

## What's his name?
I'll take three big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.

## Is that the best quality you have?
Yeah, it's the best one.

## Me? Why?
You did it! You made it. I'm a painter, too.

## Would you check out my studio some time?
Sure. I'd be glad to.

## What's your name, man?
They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.

## Nice to meet you, Shenge. Want a job?
Hi.

## You like your dad's paintings?
I'd like to squeeze your titties.

## Wanna Mac?
No, I'd like the scarf.

## That's a beautiful name. French?
No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me.

## What? What do you want?
Fame. My liquid hijack Marlboros and the moon and the cow that jumped over it.

## Jean Michel Basquiat.
Can you put me in the ring with him?

## Uh huhh... Band practice? It's Benny. He wants to know why you're not at band practice...?
Fuck... I forgot about that.

## Tony Bennett... What do you mean?
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.

## So what?
So shut up and keep painting..

## What time is it?
5,11.

## A what?
A Phillips head. From the toolbox.

## Phillips head,' right?
Yeah.

## I need this?
YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee.

## That's ignorant.
Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?

## Mr. Wayne ... Something wrong?
No, nothing, ah ... His parents ... I ... I hope he finds them.

## Vichyssoise. Supposed to be cold, right?
I suppose you feel better now, sir.

## Mr. Wayne ... a reminder, Tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck. May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?
I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...

## Ah. \"Who\", may I ask, are you going \"as\"?
Hanging on every word.

## Good joke. Wanna hear another one?
A \"he-man\"? Sure. They shine that beacon in the sky, then wonder what hole I crawl out of.

## Admiring your handiwork?
Touring the riot scene. Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.

## Ah, the direct approach. I admire that in a man with a mask. But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
Things change.

## Have we?
Sorry. I mistook me for somebody else.

## Didn't I say that?
Yes and no ...

## \"We\"? You and...
I heard on TV, \"Catwoman is thought to weigh 140 pounds.\" How do these hacks sleep at night?

## ... and me. No, that's be me and me. Is that what I said?
Yes and no...

## I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.

## Executive Assistant. Secretary. Girlfriend?
Had one. Didn't work.

## \"Vicki.\" Ice-skater, or stewardess?
Photojournalist.

## Well? Was \"Vicki\" right? About your difficulty with duality?
If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.

## S'okay, I had to go home, feed my cat.
What're you doing three dates from now?

## No hard feelings?
There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding. What say we ...

## Y'mean take off our costumes?
Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...

## Same here. So why'd you come tonight?
You first.

## Jesus, Selina, you're not the judge or?
I don't know anymore, Bruce ...

## ... What do we do?
I don't know. Till we figure it out, let's ... let's keep dancing.

## Weird, huh?
Course you're feeling fine ... You almost made a monster the Mayor of Gotham City.

## I am the light of this city. And I am its mean, twisted soul. Does it really matter who's the \"mayor\"?
It does to me.

## Selina! Selina Kyle!? You're fired! And Bruce -- Bruce Wayne! Why are you dressed up as Batman?
He is Batman, you moron.

## Down, Oswald. We have to talk. You see we've got something in common.
You killed me, Batman killed me, Penguin killed me. Three lives down. Got enough bullets to finish me off?

## Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?
Batman. The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.

## Huh? You're implying I'm some kinda psycho criminal?
Are you perchance a registered voter? I'm also a mayoral prospect.

## Y'mean frame him?
You're quick. Mayor Cobblepot.

## Yes. Yes. Boyfriend trouble ..?
PMS.

## You buy this \"blurry\" business?
No, just give you a splitting headache.

## And exactly why?
Yawn. That coulda come from anywhere.

## What about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in Gotham?
If there were such documents -- and that is not an admission -- I would have seen to it they were shredded.

## Don't look, Oswald. It's a surprise.
A lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference. By the way, how's Fred Adkins, your old partner?

## A big bag of fan mail? Filthy lucre? Wait don't tell me ... Is it a broad?
Wonder if it's worth my time.

## Reclaim my birthright, y'mean?
Imagine, You'll have the ear of the media. Access to captains of industry. Unlimited poon- tang ...

## And a very, very good one.
And who ... would you say this to?

## It's our secret. Honest. How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
I must protect my interests, Ms. Kyle. And Interest Number One, is moi.

## Actually I have to split. Take a \"personal day.\" You don't mind? Max, you're tops.
Morning, Max. Bummer about the store. You insured?

## How long has it been, Uncle Alfred?
Ten years. Barbara isn't really me niece, sir. She's Joanna Clark's daughter.

## Too late for what, dear child?
I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.

## Uncle Alfred?
In spirit only, I'm afraid.

## Secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house, don't you think?
Well, I hope you'll stay with us.

## But I can't can I?
No, my boy. I'm afraid none of us can.

## Have you ever regretted your life working here, Alfred?
Attending to heroes? No sir. My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.

## I've spent my whole life trying to beat back death. What good are all my heroics now if I can't save you?
Everyone dies, Master Bruce. There's no defeat in that. Victory comes in fighting for what we know is right while we still live.

## What seems to be the problem?
Women.

## Pheromones?
Glandular secretions from animals. Scents that create powerful emotions. Fear. Rage...

## What is it?
It appears, sir, that someone has stolen the batsignal.

## Alfred, are you...?
My parents were killed in an auto accident ten years ago. Alfred has been supporting me ever since.

## Hey, what's your problem?
I guess, the truth is I'm just not comfortable with the idle rich. Even when they try to act like heroes.

## What are you talking about?
Alfred and Bruce are like family.

## Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
Alfred's happy here.

## Alpha. Got it. What the hell is attack plan Alpha?
Divide and conquer.

## Why?
I don't know. It just feels right.

## Nice suit. And today you are?
Nightwing. Scourge of darkest evil.

## This is all about fashion for you, isn't it?
It's the gear. Chicks love the gear.

## You think Freeze will take the bait?
He'll be here.

## How did you...?
Open Sesame...Chicken.

## Remember the victim at the airport. Toxins introduced through the mouth.
Can he save her?

## What are you talking about?
Don't make me kill you in front of the girl.

## What can I do for you, Doctor? A research grant? A hospital wing?
Actually, I already work for you. Or did. Your arboreal preservation project in South America.

## That lab was consumed by fire last week. how did you manage to escape?
I have here a proposal showing how Wayne Enterprises can immediately cease all actions that toxify our environment.

## Tell me, billionaire, would you warm faster to my pleas if I looked more like Ms. January here?
Although the Wayne Foundation is hosting the event, sadly I will be unable to attend. Thank you all. Good day, Doctor.

## Physical perfection, charm and wealth tossed over for a dowdy spinster. How do you explain your behavior?
I can't. But perhaps tonight, over dinner...I've just had an opening.

## No!?
Umm. What I mean is...no plans at the moment...

## Can I get some help over here?
You're not even listening to me.

## You just called me Ivy. Who's Ivy?
I wish I knew.

## Bruce? What are you doing?
Make a choice, Bruce. Her or me.

## What happened to his wife?
Presumed dead. No one knows.

## We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
Absolutely. Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.

## I got the diamond. Quell problemo, Bruce?
You left your back wide open. Freeze could have killed you.

## Anybody want to tell us kids in the cheap seats who Joanna Clark is?
She wants to kill you.

## Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's. But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?
Impressive

## An enticing offer. But what does the lady want in return?
Let's cool it for now. There's someone I want you to meet.

## I love that belt. What are you, about a fifty Big and Tall?
I always go a size smaller. Makes me look slimmer.

## I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the gardens?
Make yourself right at home.

## Where is my wife?
There was nothing I could do. Batman deactivated her. She's dead.

## Kill them. Of course. But why stop there? Why should only Batman and Robin die while the society that created them goes unpunished?
Adam and Evil.

## Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
Inspired, Ms. Ivy.

## HAVEN What say we turn up the heat?
I'm glad you came. I can't breathe without you.

## How about dangerous curves?
Of trust. Tell me your plan.

## What do you mean?
You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal. These lips can be murder.

## Then you never loved me?
You're too late. Say bye-bye birdie.

## What exactly are you working on in there? What are those screams?
Without your research, I could never have come this far. Join me. The two of us, entwined, side by side...

## The dreams again, sir?
I think they're getting worse.

## ...Would it be a terrible imposition to ask you to take better care of your equipment?
Then you'd have nothing to complain about.

## How's the sonar coming, Alfred?
A few hitches sir, but I'm confident we'll have a prototype in no time.

## Scholarly research?
She has an excellent mind.

## Do you remember the night I fell into that cave and the bat chased me?
Your parents' wake. Rain fell like tears.

## Gee, I'm not sure. Alfred? How many rooms? Total?
Ninety-three, including the sauna.

## What did you say?
He killed them. Two-Face. He slaughtered that boy's parents.

## Is he all right?
I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.

## He ran away?
Actually, he took the car.

## He boosted the Jag? Is that all?
Not the Jaguar. The _other_ car.

## Maybe they're right.
The _Rolls_?

## Which `they' might that be, sir?
Jack Napier's dead. My parents are avenged. The Wayne Foundation contributes a small fortune to police and crime prevention programs.

## Why, indeed?
Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family...

## How are you feeling, young man?
Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.

## Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.

## What?
...Afraid.

## What?
I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me. Oh my God, Alfred.

## Master, Bruce?
...Batman, Alfred. I'm Batman.

## What do maniacs always want?
Recognition, of course.

## And another name for Mystery?
Enigma.

## Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase. Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
All except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of. But it hasn't yet been tested.

## How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
Master Wayne's dead wives.

## And you are?
...dual personalities. Abnormal psychology. Washington's poster child for the criminally insane. I read your work.

## Why's that?
Let's just say I could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent.

## I didn't know that. See? You _are_ interesting. And call me Chase. By the way, do you have a first name? Or do I just call you bats?
He's home. I sent the signal.

## What's wrong?
I wish I could say my interest in you was purely professional...

## Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?
A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.

## My life's an open book. You read?
I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.

## You like strong women. I've done my homework. Or do I need skin-tight vinyl and a whip?
I haven't had much luck with women...

## Welcome to my parlor said the Riddler to the Bat. How's tricks?
No more tricks, Edward. Release Chase and Dick. This is between you and me.

## I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I?
Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.

## Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
I'm gonna need that hand back, Ed.

## Banzai.
Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. But what exactly is on your mind?

## I notice you've sub-divided your B coupons. Feeling a little light on principle?
Actually, I like to divest just before a major re-capitalization.

## How can I help you, Mr. Wayne?
Somebody's been sending me love letters. Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion.

## Psychiatrists make you nervous?
Just ones this beautiful.

## The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?
On occasion. Usually at night.

## She's a Malaysian dream warden. She stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams. Need one?
Me? No. Only things that need calming in my dreams are the Rockettes.

## So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?
Exactly.

## What do you know about obsession?
Not much.

## I'm sorry. Who are you?
Like normal folks.

## What? This isn't normal?
That kid is amazing.

## The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
Don't believe it. I'm just skin deep.

## Look, I'm rock climbing Sunday. How about coming along?
Bruce, much to my surprise, you seem like a really great guy...

## What?
I said I'm sure he did.

## Sorry. I haven't even had time to unpack. Instant coffee okay?
And now....

## Why do I feel like the other man, here?
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.

## What?
In a sense we are all two people. The side we show in daylight. And that side we keep in shadow.

## So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman?
Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.

## Spare me the diagnosis, okay? You're being ridiculous. I can't be jealous of Batman. Can I?
And the beast slouches towards Bethelem.

## Okay, tiger, take it slow. You going to give me your pin or something?
Your memories are repressed. They're trying to break through. Relax. Try to remember-.

## What does it say? What hurts so much, Bruce? What does the book say?
I don't-.

## Back off, man.
What are you talking about?

## But what about all the good we can do? There are monsters out there. Gotham needs us.
What the hell did you think you were doing?

## And when you finally get Two-Face?
Exactly. And once you'd killed him you'd be lost. Like me. All this has to be a choice. Otherwise...it's a curse.

## Of course you are. And what a grand pursuit you must be. What do you think of my new invention?
Edward...

## How could I forget?
Can't tell if you don't say please.

## Paranoid? The psychotic?
...The Box can change their lives. Our stock coupons will spike.

## Fred?
I'll show you it works.

## What the hell is going on here?
...Fired...your fired...your fired. You understand?! Fired!!

## ...You gonna kill me?
Might. Might not. Could say we're of two minds on the subject.

## What say we flip for it?
...or death.

## That floor has got to be very hard. Is that better?
Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.

## How'd you find us?
Congratulations. You get to die on the dean's list.

## Where are you sending Batboy this time?
Here. Get a good seat.

## About what?
Everything.

## How high up would you say that is?
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.

## Which bathroom is that, sir?
The small one.

## Yes?
Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.

## Actually, I wanted to talk to Batman. Pass that on to Mr. Wayne, would you?
Excuse me, sir. Commissioner Gordon was compelled to leave - -very unexpectedly. He asked me to convey his regrets.

## Where's the boy?
Batman! Don't you even recognize your old pal Jack? After all... ... You made me what I am today.

## How do I know you won't keep them all?
I'll take you with me.

## ... How long have I been out?
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.

## What is this stuff? Kevlar?
Better. It's not on the market yet.

## How'd you find this place?
Exploring. In the woods. Many years ago. -- I was a solitary child.

## What is that?
Photo database. I'll do your photos now.

## I just can't absorb it all. This place, the equipment. What it must have cost. Why all the secrecy? Why do you wear the mask?
I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.

## Is this what you wanted?
You could've killed him, you know. You could've killed the Joker.

## What is it you want?
I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.

## Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
Because I... ... Because she'd never speak to me again.

## Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
Alfred, bring something for Mr. Knox -- I'll have one, too.

## I don't... seek publicity -- Will you be staying in Gotham for a while?
As far as I know.

## Do you sail?
Too much work. I'm not really the physical type -- Thank you, Alfred.

## That's a tough one. Have you ever seen combat?
No.

## What did you see?
... Terror.

## ... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...
I know it's late. I -- Are you there?

## So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We -- -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you?
No one would miss me.

## What if I could save a handful? -- What if I could save one?
Bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself.

## How can you do that if she's already off the line?
Hang on. I have to leave a message.

## In all these years... Why couldn't I see how it wold turn out?
I don't know why I'm doing this. I half wish you'd stay a cripple.

## Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or all of me?
We'll raid the Ace the moment we get a warrant.

## All right, Bruce, what do you suggest?
I don't know. I'm just a D.A. I don't have access to all you expert sources.

## Let's beat it, man. I don't like it up here.
What are you talking about?

## Very good idea, Jack. In fact -- -- I'd like you to handle this operation personally.
What are you, scared of heights?

## Why do you need me to handle a simple break-in?
Jack - - please - - WIPE THAT LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.

## And what happens if we say no?
Nobody wants a war, Carmine. If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.

## That's it?
That's it.

## Maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist. People might like to see the face behind the makeup.
Joker here. Can we talk?

## ... Behind the makeup?
I've seen worse. Much worse.

## ... Why the mask?
Honey - - I would know any randomly selected square inch of Vicki Vale. If I had a good enough hint.

## Too much glamor, huh. What's in the bag - - Monte Carlo? Apes in Kenya?
God, Vick, a girl could get hurt doing this.

## A girl could get killed - - so they tell me. What's new and hot in Gotham City?
Oh, it's too good. We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.

## Evildoers, huh? Big or small?
Small so far. I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.

## Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser. Did you get your invitation yet?
Oh, absolutely. Bruce and I are very close.

## Man, I feel like Robin Leach. You actually know all these people?
Some. I am a rich bitch, remember? I'm quoting.

## Where does one man get all this junk?
All aver the world. They say he's spent half of his life overseas.

## What were you thinking?
Yum, yum.

## Peanuts?
Yeah. Peanuts. Which is how he goes through women.

## Something like this -- what do you suppose this could drive a guy to?
You are on drugs.

## Are they paying you for all this?
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.

## ... Oh? Why is that, Vicki?
He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent. They would know.

## Not what?
He's not crazy.

## Jesus, Vicki! Where is it?
It's gone.

## Yeeees?
And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while.

## There aren't hotels?
Yes, there are hotels. They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family. Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.

## And what did you say?
I said I'd check with you.

## David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
Yes. Yes. Sometime.

## Tom Jones?
Well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like ...

## Did you really ask?
I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...

## Ali? What's wrong?
Your face smells like a foot.

## Yes. And I have a wine for dinner that will kill you.
Hi,

## Great. You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else. Did you?
Sort of half.....

## Meaning?
I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake.

## Nothing ever really changes, does it, David?
Let's get a coffee.

## It was nothing. We're not ... He just makes me laugh. When was the last time we laughed? Any of us?
I know... I know. I've been an arsehole of spectacular proportions. Olympic standard.

## He doesn't like to say much does he?
Right first time.

## Seems to be a problem with the door. Where's the picture gone?
Ahm.....

## What? What?
Oh Jesus. Oh God. Oh Jesus God. Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh Jesus of Nazareth.

## Howls he getting on with the family?
Ah. Fine. It's good. It's great.

## And howls Alison?
She's ... well, she's good.

## Isn't it?
Look, I've left Bean on his own. Nice to chat though Bernie - always a subtle joy.

## Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right?
Not necessarily. That's where this ... comes in. No, I've had a better idea than sacking people. You'll hear soon enough.

## Everything okay, David?
Yes. Ahm. I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.

## David?
We'll be able to start this afternoon. I'11 pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery. Now, that'll impress the Governor.

## I beg your pardon?
I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.

## Yes, although, I really..... thank you. Yes, it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited.
Tomorrow. You have a problem with that?

## Glad to hear it. Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?
You're not going to ....

## Exactly. She's in a surprisingly terrible state. Isn't she, Bean?
... you have to sack me. I understand, sir. I'll go quietly. In fact I'll go right now.

## Well, congratulations. Isn't that great, David?
Certainly is.

## I'm fired? Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...

## What makes you say that?
Richard Burton was very good-looking.

## Jen - you don't wanna talk about it?
It's you and Mom that need to talk.

## You arrange those flowers yourself?
Sure did.

## They're pretty. Learn it in the army?
No - but when you've torn out a man's throat with your bare hands, you learn to appreciate the beautiful things in life.

## I'11 give you a chance... Know anything about computers?
Hey, En, nice bike'- but remember, any kids you have are gonna look just like its handsome driver.

## Is Jenny gonna be okay?
She was wearing a helmet. It could have been worse.

## How the hell should I know?
... in the distant future.

## Yes?
We need you urgently in C Theatre.

## off the peg?
Yes it is ... may I introduce you To Bern ...

## You know the thing I hate most about children?
Nope.

## You know, Mr. Bean's okay. You're not gonna kick him out, are you, Dad?
Of course he is.

## What's gone?
The TV.

## What?
This sucks.

## Uh, huh huh, this is Las Vegas?
Yeah, heh heh. I thought there'd be casinos and lights and stuff.

## Hey Butt-Head, why's that guy holding a sign?
Uh... maybe he's blind... Huh huh, check this out.

## Me first?
Yeah, really.

## Huh huh. You mean like this?
That's not that much.

## You mean there's mre than one?
Huh huh huh. Hey Beavis. We're on a bus with chicks.

## Hey, where'd those chicks go?
Uh... I think you scared them off.

## This sucks. What are we doing here? Weren't we suppost'a go to Washington and score or something?
This sucks. It's all hot and stuff.

## Yeah or like a Seven-Eleven or something... Are we almost there?
Uh...

## Could you, like, tell her we're ready to score?
I always thought there was something wrong with him. Heh heh heh.

## Heh heh. Bye bye. Heh heh.
Uh hey, does anyone wanna see my unit?

## Hey Butt-Head, do you think we're ever gonna score?
Yeah, we're gonna score.

## Yeah, I'm hoping to do some sluts too. Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in Las Vegas?
Uh, we didn't score yet.

## Does that say Xanax?
Um, um, yeah, probably. Heh heh.

## Do you have T.P.? T.P. for my bunghole?
We'll get you whatever you want. Get that other kid. We might need him.

## Ah, the witness?
Yes. You can never be too careful Bork.

## You see what I see, Bork?
I see it. I don't get it.

## Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
Well, sir it's not good. Roll the tape... The X-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon, a manmade virus...

## Cavity search...?
Deep and hard.

## Chief, you know that guy whose camper they were whacking off in?
Bork! You are a federal agent. You represent the United States Government... Never end a sentence with a preposition. Try again.

## That's better. Yes?
We've run a sample through the National Criminal Sperm Bank and come up with two possible genetic matches for a father.

## What the hell...? Bork! That bus we picked up. Where was it headin'?
D.C., Chief.

## Well, Earl said you guys were young, but jeez... Oh well, as long as you can get the job done. So what are your names?
Uh, Butt-Head.

## That's right. I'm offering you ten grand plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?
Whoa, huh huh. Cool.

## Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
She sure does.

## This is Travis and Bob... What's your last name, dear?
Uh, my butt and your...uh, butt.

## You were a roadie for Motley Crue?
Uh, huh huh, this fat dude. He said we could do you. And he was gonna pay us.

## Muddy! Sonofabitch! Hold it. What's he payin' ya?
Uh, ten uh...

## Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it. You've finished the streets?
Almost.

## Manchurian Tung oil? Where did you get it?
Helen got it for me in Oslo.

## How's your arm?
I'm not sure. It feels... frozen.

## What?
That's how long you were gone.

## Anything happen while I was away?
Yes it did. Yes it did. I made a couple of small discoveries. Here's one.

## Cabin fever, hon?
Maybe this is heaven.

## She can't see you, right? In the book, Rule Number Two, the living usually won't see the dead.
But I'm not hungry, are you?

## They make gypsies look good.
Won't? Or can't?

## Is this a punishment for something we did in life? What can we do?
I don't know if there's anything we can do.

## That's it? No number, or instructions?
Nothing. The bio buster? I don't get it...

## What about this Beetle guy?
We don't know who he is... ... I'm going to talk to that little girl.

## Look at this, everything is different down here. All our furniture is gone.
I don't know... what are you looking up?

## How long do you suppose we were waiting?
We'd like some help in getting rid of the people who moved in here. Barbara and I worked very hard on this house.

## God, this is so corny. Have we been reduced to this? Sheets?
Think of them as death shrouds. And the moaning is important. Really moan! Practice, practice, practice.

## Where are your skulls and bones?
You know you're really a pretty girl.

## Did you copy these gravestones right, Adam?
Three times. Powerful number.

## Maybe we should knock first?
She's only fourteen...

## The sushi? I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi?
N... No, I just did the Ink Spots.

## Who did the sushi?
Maybe they'll leave now. That snake was a pretty nasty customer.

## You know, I've been thinking. I could teach Lydia to sew.
Adam! Why did you build a whorehouse? Have you ever been to...?

## Little black party dresses?
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls. She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...

## What...?
Just a hunch.

## What time is it?
3,30 I guess.

## A... Are you the guys who're hiding out in the attic?
We're ghosts.

## What?
Night of the Living Dead? It's this gross movie.

## Is this like a trick question?
Nobody else can.

## Why are you creeping around Delia's bedroom?
We were trying to scare your mother.

## You did this? You carved all these little figures and houses and things?
I certainly did. I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.

## And this used to be your house, I bet. Why do you want to scare everybody?
We want to frighten you away. So that you'll move out.

## You don't know the Deetzes very well, do you? My father bought this place. He never walks away from equity. Why don't you leave?
We weren't there. The handbook says funerals aren't for the dead.

## God, if this is true this is like, amazing! I kinda like it up here. Can I visit you sometimes?
You tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house.

## What is going on?
Really. I don't know.

## Did you get the paint?
W... We didn't know how to make one.

## Nine months? What difference does that make?
Good luck. You're going to use up all your help vouchers.

## Wait for who?
For Juno, your caseworker. Not that it matters to your type. But there are all these other people here ahead of you. I'd say three hours.

## Hell no! I'm rolling. I'm a businessman. I'm the man what am do I gotta kill?
You don't kill anyone.

## Can you scare them off?
We tried.

## Handbook? When...?
Out.

## All right. Who are you?
I'd nearly given up on you. I was about to leave. I do have other clients.

## Are you Juno, our case worker?
Yes. I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.

## -- Like you used to be?
Yes.

## Our cemetery?
The whorehouse was my idea. I want Betelgeuse out of the picture! We've got some serious talking to do.

## What about Betelgeuse?
Forget him. He'll remain with his whores until someone calls him. You need to worry about people like Otho.

## You're not gross. Why were you wearing a sheet?
We're practicing.

## Funeral. God, you guys really are! What was it like? The funeral. Did you cry?
I don't wear that stuff to bed wrong with it. I'm getting out of here.

## No you don't! No... Lydia... Why?
Life is just... too awful.

## How'd you do on the science test?
It was gross. They wanted me to dissect a frog. I told them no way. I said it was against my religion. I got a C.

## And live in what, our station wagon?
Barbara Maitland, sweetie, you just listen now. This house is too big. It really ought to be for a couple with a family.

## Are you a spirit too?
Sort of. High spirit. Heh heh. Listen, cookie, I've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years. All I want is to get out.

## You do? Over here? On my side?
I think so.

## That's right. They treat you like scum I bet?
Yeah.

## Minor problem. The rules. I can't tell it to you. But... do you know how to play charades?
You've got to help them.

## Can you help me?
... I will.

## W... What is it?
W... What is it?

## He's your cousin.
Your qu...? But you're...

## What's he going to do? Viciously rearrange their environment?
Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.

## Why not?
Delia hates it.

## Where is your mother?
Stepmother. She's out torturing the movers.

## What?
I'm lonely.

## Answer your mother.
Dad. Do you believe me?

## Otho, could you actually... do something with them?
They're... not here anymore.

## Yeah yeah, we'll think on it. 'Bye ya, Charles. You relax up there, ya hear?
I don't care from guilt. I just want to see them.

## Are they suffering?
They're already dead. They can't feel a thing.

## This is our first meal in this house, Lydia. Why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?
I say let's keep it the way it is.

## Any particular kind?
Joke! Joke! Aspirin! It doesn't matter what brand.

## The rest of the house is probably worse. When can you and I get started?
No time like the present, as my wicked stepmother used to say.

## What's wrong?
I thought I saw something.

## Okay?
That's Charles' study. But you don't have to even look in there. He'll love whatever you do to it. He's such a sheep.

## You don't have a key?
Maybe Charles does.

## Are they still here, Otho?
Oh, they're still here. They're Just not showing up.

## What's happening to them?
I don't know.

## Are we going to be seeing you at Miss Shannon's Boarding School?
Yes, but I'm going to live at home.

## It's okay. How's the dirt business?
Well, I just placed a call to your mother. She had stepped out but I have some news for her.

## All presences have a home space. A place where they live, so to speak. Where do they hide out?
The attic.

## Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's?
Claim...? ... Oh, claim, that's what Thomas asked me.

## Thomas? Who's Thomas?
Thomas Franklin, an attorney.

## An attorney?
Yes.

## Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys?
There's no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one.

## Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician?
No.

## Chauncey, there you are. What are you doing on that leg?
It's fine today, Robert.

## ... Were you going somewhere?
No, Robert.

## ... Oh? You've heard?
Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to meet the President.

## He does, does he?
Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock.

## How do I know when it's ten o'clock?
... It's five of, you'd best get on in there.

## Oh, really?
... He's gone, Chauncey.

## Will you be leaving now, Robert?
In a day or two, yes.

## ... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr... ... Chance...?
Yes. I love Eve very much.

## I see... ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
Yes, Robert - I am. I'll go tell Eve about Ben now, Robert.

## Stay here? Is that necessary?
Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.

## He's very intense, and internal, don't you think?
At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor.

## Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days. ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?
No, Eve... I'm sorry.

## ... But he's...?
He's resting comfortably now. There's no cause for alarm, yet...

## ... Do you think we should look for him?
I have no idea...

## Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?
Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.

## Very well... Can we rule out inefficiency...?
I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.

## And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.

## Do you know Raphael?
No sir, I don't believe I do.

## Would you care to take it, sir?
Yes.

## ... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.

## Your family doctor?
I agree.

## Would you care for a drink?
Yes. Thank you.

## May I ask your name?
My name is Chance.

## Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
No. I'm a gardener.

## Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?
No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.

## Did you lose something?
Yes. I lost my remote control.

## Won't your injury prevent you from attending to business, Mr. Gardiner?
No. It won't do that.

## ... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
No. The Old Man died and Louise left.

## Yes. Are you going to leave and close the house when he dies?
... Why... No, I don't think so...

## Good. I'm glad to hear that. ... How did you like meeting the President?
Fine. He's very nice.

## Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?
He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.

## ... Mentor...?
Forgive me, Chauncey - I didn't mean to pry. You must have been very close to him.

## I'm sorry... ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?
Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.

## What is that?
Our greenhouse.

## How is Ben feeling?
He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.

## ... You don't happen to have a tuxedo in your suitcase, do you?
No, thank you.

## Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?
No, Eve. I don't read the papers.

## I know... ... So are you, Chauncey ... ... Do you mind my being here, like this?
No, Eve. I like you to be here.

## ... You know, Chauncey... I want us to be... I want us... You and I to become... close... I want us to become very close, you know...?
Yes, Eve. I know that.

## To watch...? To watch me...?
Yes. I like to watch.

## ... Is that all you want...? ... To watch me...?
Yes. It's very good, Eve.

## ... But I've never done... ... You mean...? When... When... When I do it? ... When I touch myself...?
That's very interesting, Eve.

## Can you see well?
Yes, very well, thank you.

## Do you like it?
Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.

## ... Are you sure you like it?
Yes, I do, it's very good.

## How is my dear friend Benjamin feeling?
Regretfully, Mrs. Rand - I shall yield the pleasure of your company to others.

## To exchange our thoughts - what does a Russian know about business? On the other hand, what does an American know about diplomacy?
Yes, I understand.

## I agree.
Do you think so? Do you think so?

## ... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
Yes. I am very hungry.

## Oh. When you say 'Your house has been closed', you mean to say that your business was shut down?
Yes. Chauncey is fine.

## Chauncey, up and around this morning, are you?
Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.

## He's a decent fellow, the President, isn't he?
Yes, Ben - he is.

## Yes, Ben - are you going to die now?
... I'm about to surrender the Horn of Plenty for the Horn of Gabriel, my boy...

## Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
Yes. I like to watch very much.

## Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
Yes.

## May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?
Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.

## ... Sir?
Yes.

## ... Did you wish to see someone, sir?
Yes, I would like to see Ben.

## ... Then you really are a gardener?
Yes.

## What about money?
I never needed money.

## Some pictures...?
Yes. Of men and women.

## How about taxes, Mr. Chance, surely you must have paid taxes?
No.

## Might you have a birth certificate, Mr. Chance?
No. That's where Joe fixed the bricks.

## Can you walk? It's not broken, is it?
It's very sore.

## Let's have a look, do you mind?
Of course. I would like to look.

## It's starting to swell, is it painful?
Yes.

## I assure you, sir, David is a very careful driver. Please, won't you let us take you?
... Yes. You can take me.

## Does it have a television?
No - but Mr. Rand does have one with an electric motor, that way he can get around by himself.

## How long do we stay in here?
How long? I don't know, see what the doctor says ...

## Is his back feeling better?
Good morning, Louise.

## Well, no more stewin' those prunes every mornin', that's somethin', I guess... ... what are you goin' to do now, Chance?
I'm going to work in the garden.

## Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his speech at the Financial Institute the President consulted with you and Benjamin Rand, did he not?
Yes. I was there with Ben.

## Don't we need a leader capable of guiding us through the seasons? The bad as well as the good?
Yes. We need a very good gardener.

## ... Are you waiting for someone? An appointment?
Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.

## Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.

## ... You've quite a sense of humor, Mr. Chance - but all kidding aside, may I ask just what you are doing here?
I live here.

## ... How long have you been living here?
Ever since I can remember, since I was a child.

## Since you were a child?
Yes, Thomas. I have always been here. I have always worked in the garden.

## Do you have any proof of your employment, Mr. Chance - any checks from the deceased, any contracts or documents?
No.

## How were you paid?
I was given meals, and a home...

## Mr. Chance, perhaps you could show us some identification with your address -- a Driver's License, a credit card, checkbook?
No, I do not have any of those.

## ... Joe? Who's Joe?
Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952.

## 1952...?
Yes. I remember when he came. He was very fat and had short hair and showed me some pictures from a funny little book.

## Have you served in the Army?
No, Thomas. But I have seen the Army on television.

## Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance?
No, I don't think so. And I have planted and shaped all the hedges, and in the springtime you will be able to see my flowers.

## ... Do you drive this, Mr. Chance?
No, Thomas. I have never been in an automobile.

## What are your plans now, Mr. Chance?
I would like to stay and work in my garden.

## But you won't sign, correct?
Correct.

## Do you agree with Ben, Mr. Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives?
As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.

## ... Spring and summer... Yes, I see... Fall and winter. Yes, indeed... Could you go through that one more time, please, Mr. Gardiner?
Yes. It has.

## ... You will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you?
Yes. I will.

## ... Skip the levity, Kinney - what have you got?
... I realize this sounds banal but there is no information of any sort on Gardiner. We have no material on him - zilch...

## Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm out... How are you feeling?
Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.

## No headaches?
No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told.

## You heard?
I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.

## Hah!... Tell me the truth, Eve - if I wait until I feel better, will I ever meet the man?
Oh. I'm very sorry. Well, if you have any need for any of our facilities, please do not hesitate to ask.

## Do you need a secretary?
I'm becoming quite attached to Chauncey - quite attached... ... And so are you, aren't you, Eve.

## Huh... I'm glad they're along with her, if you know what I mean... How about Jack?
Well, I think Jack needs some time alone with you, darling... He's getting to that age, you know... He really misses you...

## ... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...

## ... Would you take me on a tour?
Gladly... ... The safe is in Mr. Jennings' bedroom, that'll be stop number one.

## ... What do you make of all this?
We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.

## But... Where was this man Gardiner before last week?
I see. Clearly, such interest on their part is of great political significance.

## So...? Where the hell is it?
We... uh, have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at Mr. Rand's home ... and, uh...

## What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman?
Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent.

## ... So what does all that add up to?
I would appreciate that.

## Good. Anything else?
Yes, chief - eight other foreign powers have put Gardiner under surveillance. We're around-the clock now, sir - I'll keep you posted.

## ... Well?
Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.

## It's that serious, huh?
I'm afraid so.

## Say, aren't you that actor guy?
Yeah.

## Who am I thinking of?
I don't know.

## When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly?
Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.

## What?
Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.

## Which one is Elijah again?
The monkey.

## Is the trial date set?
May 11th.

## Why'd you do it, Craig?
I'm a puppeteer.

## Why, Craig. why?
I... puppeteer.

## Hmmm.
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?

## Some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks. Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, huh?
Hmmm.

## Did you eat?
Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.

## I'm sorry. How was your evening?
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.

## The ferret?
The iguana.

## Yeah. You want a beer?
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.

## What?
I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours.

## Now?
Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house.

## I've been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing. I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't that the craziest thing?
What, are you nuts? That's Oprah talking.

## How was it?
I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.

## Why?
Don't crowd me, Craig.

## So how was it? What was he doing?
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.

## I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.

## What?
I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.

## What's that?
Us, of course.

## What about Maxine?
Fuck Maxine.

## You were him last night, weren't you?
Yes.

## We?
Me and John.

## I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head?
Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.

## What's that?
I'm a puppeteer.

## He's a lucky man. Do I know him?
It's Elijah.

## The iguana?
The monkey.

## You came up here looking for the portal?
Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.

## You saw it once. Now you see it again. That's life, isn't it? And you were up here to try the same thing, weren't you?
I suppose. But they got here first, the lousy bastards. So now it's all over, I guess.

## You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
People make mistakes.

## I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer?
Maxine...

## Simulates?
No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester.

## Pardon?
Schwartz.

## Money, Miss Warts?
Forget it.

## Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply misspoke.
Mr. Juarez?

## Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you feel you can bring to LesterCorp?
Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.

## You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
Glooph is not a letter, sir.

## Just one. Why is this floor so short?
Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the savings on to you. But seriously, that's all covered in orientation.

## I wasn't toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you?
I'll keep that in mind, sir.

## I see. Are you unhappy at our little company?
No sir, not at all. It's just that I'm going to open my own business and...

## Is that true?
Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.

## I just wanted to say hi. Did you know I still don't know your name or where you work?
Yeah.

## Just.
Why not?

## You married?
Yeah. But enough about me.

## What'll you have?
The usual, Barry.

## My tits?
No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...

## That's the usual?
Dont let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.

## Don't you want to know what happened to me?
No.

## Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.

## Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.

## Tickets to Malkovich?
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.

## You wanted to be partners with me?
Sure. It'd be fun.

## Are you torturing me on purpose?
I've fallen in love.

## Of course, right this way, Mr. Malkovich. Compliments of the house.
Lotte? Is that you?

## What happens when a man climbs through his own portal?
How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.

## Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
Ha ha ha!

## Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...

## Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
No. Don't be an ass.

## Can I be anyone I want?
You can be John Malkovich.

## Vegas? What'd you think?
The kid's got talent. You've never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions.

## A scary dream?
No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream.

## How'd it go? Did you say the philodendron gets water or no?
No, for God's sake, I just watered it yesterday. It almost went well. I gave a pretty good dream, but circumstances arose.

## What kind of circumstances?
Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.

## Do tell. I love a good plan.
The Great Mantini?

## Why are you being like this?
I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.

## Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.

## Gehginnis ondah foam?
Forget it.

## Fork ah did?
Fine woman, Floris. I don't know how she puts up with this damn speech impediment of mine.

## Yes, my dear?
Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.

## Do you?
TRUMAN PUPPET It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them.

## Do you?
It's like nothing I've ever felt before. I think I'm going crazy.

## Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.

## You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?
I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.

## I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.

## You don't look a day over one hundred and five, Captain. What's your secret?
Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil.

## Do we get to wear a crown?
But of course.

## Tell me, Lotte, can you understand a word I'm saying?
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.

## Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
With immense pleasure, my dear. Down that hall, ninth door on the left. Watch the step down. It's sunken, you know.

## But why, Son of Malkovich?
I blew it, Dr. Lester.

## Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
No.

## Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad. Hi, are you Craig's wife?
Yes, Hi.

## Ah.
Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet?

## When?
Give me one hour to get inside him Exactly.

## We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.
Did you see the reviews?

## What's the play?
Say... \"Equus\"? It's got everything.

## Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.

## Is there dancing?
No.

## Who's calling?
You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.

## How'd you get this number?
It's just that I fantasize about you and, well, speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and...

## Can I get you a drink?
Whatever you're having.

## So, do you enjoy being an actor?
Oh sure. It's very rewarding...

## Do you mind?
Come on in.

## Yes. How did you know it was me?
Lotte called me.

## You still there, sweets?
Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists.

## You mean with Malkovich?
Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.

## Vegas. Can you arrange that?
I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today.

## Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us?
He's a selfish bastard.

## Bad dream, darling?
I've got to leave Malkovich.

## What want ye, girl child?
I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.

## Then what do I do?
Know it, and go on out the yard. Go on.

## This Saturday - you coming to Call or what?
If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them.

## You getting into bed to think about yellow?
I likes yellow.

## Then what? When you get through with blue and yellow, then what?
Can't say. It's something can't be planned.

## You blaming God. That what you're doing?
No, Stamp. I ain't.

## You saying nothing counts?
I'm saying they came into my yard.

## You saying God give up? Nothing left for us but pour out our own blood?
I'm saying they came into my yard.

## You punishing Him, ain't you?
Not like He punished me.

## We have to be steady. \"These things too will pass\". What you looking for? A miracle?
No. I'm looking for what I was put here to look for, the back door.

## THE WHITEFOLK?
What do you know about it? I sleep where I want.

## YOU CAME BACK BECAUSE OF ME?
YES.

## YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
YOUR FACE IS MINE.

## WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?
I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU AGAIN.

## CAN THEY GET IN HERE?
NO. THEY TRIED ONCE BUT I STOPPED THEM. THEY WON'T EVER COME BACK...YOU MY BEST THING.

## Well, is it now? How you getting along?
Don't pay to complain.

## They treating you right over at the Bodwins?
More than all right. Miss Bodwin, she teach me stuff..Book stuff. She says I might go to Oberlin. She's experimenting on me.

## Your mother all right?
No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten out of bed since that day.

## You think I should stop by? Think she'd welcome it?
I don't know. I think I've lost my mother, Paul D.

## You think she sure 'nough your sister?
At times. At other times I think she was...more. But who would know that better than you. I mean, you sure 'nough you her.

## And Paul D...you don't have to stay 'way, but be careful how you talk to my mama, hear?
I will.

## What you want?
I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.

## What you want'em for?
I'm looking for work. I was thinking they might know of some.

## You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
Yes ma'am.

## I heard your mother took sick, that so?
Yes ma'am..

## Fine. But what would I do at night?
Be here. In case.

## They good whitefolks?
I want to work, Miss Lady.

## Work? Start learnin your letters again?
No. I mean work work.

## Well, what can you do?
I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.

## Extra?
Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.

## Back stiff?
OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor or the skating.

## Should I wake her?
No, let her rest.

## Won't you be late for work?
DON'T LOVE HER TOO MUCH.

## DO YOU FORGIVE ME?
OUT THERE. WAY OFF.

## Mama?
Where you been keeping yourself? I told John must be cold if Stamp stay inside.

## Out where?
Was over to Baby Suggs.

## What you want there? Somebody invite you in?
That's Baby's kin. I don't need no invite to look after her people.

## Ain't no new Negroes in this town I don't know about. What she look like? You sure that wasn't Denver?
I know Denver.

## You sure?
I know what I see.

## Why's that necessary all of a sudden?
I don't know him that well.

## You know he's colored? What else there to know?
Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.

## I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.
It's her, ain't it?

## I run him off.
What's any of that got to do with Paul D.?

## You?
I told him...Showed him the newspaper. About Sethe. Read it to him. He left that very day.

## He knew Baby Suggs?
Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too.

## For what?
Well I...I did get offered one place but I just wanted to be off by myself a spell.

## You planning to do anything about it?
Oh yeah. I got big plans.

## You remember your price, Stamp?
Never found out.

## Who is she? Where she come from?
Don't know. Just shot up one day from a stump.

## Tell me something, Stamp. Tell me this one thing. How much is a nigger supposed to take?
All he can. All he can.

## Sethe?
Paul D.

## Yeah. Look bad?
No, You looking good.

## Devil's confusion. What's this I hear about you not getting out of bed? I saw Denver. She tell you?
She comes in the daytime. She still with me, my Denver.

## Don't you die on me!! This is Baby Suggs quilt. Is that what you planning!?
Oh, I don't have no plans. No plans at all.

## What, baby?
She left me. She's gone again.

## What the hell you thinking, girl? Strolling in here this late?
Don't talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don't say nothing to me this morning.

## What? What? You talking back to me?
I'm telling you don't say nothing to me.

## Uh?
Fuck.

## What do you think?
He looks like a fuckin' loser.

## So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh?
Well Dude, we just don't know.

## What are you, some kind of sad-assed refugee from the fucking sixties?
Uh-huh.

## Can we just rent it from you?
That is our most modestly priced receptacle.

## What's this?
My rug.

## I am the Walrus.
What do you mean, Dude?

## Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed off?
I'm going home, Donny.

## YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT! This Chinaman is not the issue, Dude.
What tied the room together, Dude?

## What's a pederast, Walter?
Shut the fuck up, Donny.

## If what's during league play?
Life does not stop and start at your convenience, you miserable piece of shit.

## What's wrong with Walter, Dude?
I'm shomer shabbas.

## Fucking Germans. Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.
What's that, Walter?

## Uh-huh.
They were Nazis, Dude?

## We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.
Are you gonna split hairs?

## Are they gonna hurt us, Walter?
They won't hurt us, Donny. These men are cowards.

## He's handicapped, huh?
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes. And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California.

## 1972 Pontiac LeBaron.
Jeez. Think he's got room for one more?

## Color?
Green. Some brown, or, uh, rust, coloration.

## And was there anything of value in the car?
Huh? Oh. Yeah. Tape deck. Couple of Creedence tapes. And there was a, uh... my briefcase.

## In the briefcase?
Papers. Just papers. You know, my papers. Business papers.

## And what do you do, sir?
I'm unemployed.

## Separate incidents?
Sometimes. I wouldn't hold out much hope for the tape deck though. Or the Creedence tapes.

## And the, uh, the briefcase?
Ahh, not so good, man.

## Uh-huh. That some kind of Eastern thing?
Far from it.

## Thankie... Just one thing, Dude. D'ya have to use s'many cuss words?
Take it easy, Dude.

## Wouldn't miss the semis. How things been goin'?
Ahh, you know. Strikes and gutters, ups and downs.

## Which one was Logjammin'?
People forget that the brain is the biggest erogenous zone--

## Of course you do. I can see you're anxious for me to get to the point. Well Dude, here it is. Where's Bunny?
I thought you might know, man.

## Let's say a 10% finder's fee?
No! No! NO! THAT'S NOT--

## Hello, gentlemen. You are the bereaved?
Yeah man.

## \"Johnson\"?
Thank you.

## Huh?
I was talking about my rug.

## You mean coitus?
Oh, no.

## Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua?
Take a look at this, sir.

## Do you have any news regarding my father's money?
She most certainly was not!

## Well yeah...I know that.
Is he pretending to be the abductor?

## Jeffrey.
So Dieter has the money?

## Maude?
Tell me a little about yourself, Jeffrey.

## Not the compromised second draft. And then I, uh... Ever hear of the Seattle Seven?
Mmnun.

## Oh?
Yeah. Roadie for Metallica. Speed of Sound Tour.

## What do you do for fun?
Oh, you know, the usual. Bowl. Drive around. The occasional acid flashback.

## What happened to your house?
Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.

## Finder's fee?
He thought I had your father's money, so he got me out of the way while he looked for it.

## It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's. Why did he think you had it? And who does?
Larry Sellers, a high-school kid. Real fucking brat.

## So...that doctor.
Huh. Jeez. Well, so, did he--is that yoga?

## This was a valued, uh.
Exactly. What happened to your face? Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?

## Forget it, Donny. You're out of your element.
What's your point, Walter?

## This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?
Walter, this is not a guy who built the rail- roads, here, this is a guy who peed on my--

## You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
Theodore Herzel.

## What the fuck're you talking about? The carrier. What's in the fucking carrier?
Huh? Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian. Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture.

## This is a league game. This determines who enters the next round- robin, am I wrong?
Smokey my friend, you're entering a world of pain.

## Huh?
The man is a sex offender. With a record. Spent six months in Chino for exposing himself to an eight- year-old.

## Anyway. How much they offer you?
Twenty grand. And of course I still keep the rug.

## Just for making the hand-off?
Yeah.

## It's your roll.
Huh?

## What the hell is this?
My dirty undies. Laundry, Dude. The whites.

## Oh shit. Walter.
Walter--what the fuck are you thinking?

## Yeah. So as long as we get her back, nobody's in a position to complain. And we keep the baksheesh.
What the fuck is going on there?

## Terrific, Walter. But you haven't told me how we get her back. Where is she?
That's the simple part, Dude. When we make the handoff, I grab the guy and beat it out of him.

## ...Huh?
Yeah. That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly. That's a Swiss fucking watch.

## Aitz chaim he, Dude. As the ex used to say.
What'd he say? Where's the hand- off?

## That wasn't her toe.
What the fuck is that supposed to mean? What the fuck're we gonna tell Lebowski?

## They're nihilists.
Whose toe was it, Walter?

## Huh?
They kept saying they believe in nothing.

## Who the f--have you ever heard of a little show called Branded, Dude?
Yeah.

## Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show Walter, so what?
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 156 episodes, Dude.

## I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas.
Is this your homework, Larry?

## Huh?
Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, uh.

## And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
What's your point, Dude?

## Yeah? What do you think happens when you get divorced? You turn in your library card? Get a new driver's license? Stop being Jewish?
This driveway.

## Dude here.
AS IF WE WOULD EVER DREAM OF TAKING YOUR BULLSHIT MONEY!

## Yeah.
Who is this?

## So no funny stuff. Okay?
Hey, just tell me where the fuck you want us to go.

## Employed?
You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.

## Sure! Fuck it! That's your answer! Tattoo it on your forehead! Your answer to everything!
Dude.

## Huh?
I don't know, sir.

## Is it... is it, being prepared to do the right thing? Whatever the price? Isn't that what makes a man?
Sure. That and a pair of testicles.

## Mind if I smoke a jay?
Bunny.

## Bunny Lebowski... She is the light of my life. Are you surprised at my tears, sir?
No. No Mr. Lebowski, that had not occurred to me.

## Where's the money, Lebowski?
We know the briefcase was empty, man. We know you kept the million bucks yourself.

## Well? Aren't you?
Well... yeah.

## Smokey Huh?
Impressive.

## Whatta we do about the Mex?
We'll take 'em in the morning.

## Why?
Survival.

## Where to first?
The House of Pain.

## What was that?
Nothing.

## What about Nomak?
He escaped. You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.

## how long since he was bitten?
Minutes.

## Recognize him?
From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank. He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.

## Right. So why is he dying? He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
Time.

## Anyone else make it?
I don't think so.

## For what?
It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.

## Why?
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.

## Why do you hate us so much?
I am a hunter. A weapon. It's what I do. It's in my blood.

## I don't understand.
Pain cuts the deepest, isn't that what you said?

## How does it look?
Not good.

## What do you want me to do?
I want to see the sun rise.

## How do you feel?
Like a fucking heifer took a dump in my mouth.

## Did you think I wouldn't?
Took you long enough.

## What do you think?
Sounds like a plan.

## What do you really think?
These guys are shitting bricks cause they're no longer on the top of the food chain. They're going to fuck us the first chance they get.

## Where were you, Whistler?
I'll show you.

## What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Eau de suckhead. Tasty.

## Where the hell have you been?
Just out connecting a few dots.

## And so will we.
Then who does he work for?

## Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
Spare me the race card, OJ. We're not going out into the sun. It's too risky.

## So?
So I think you people may have underestimated how many Reapers you're dealing with.

## For what?
You want me to hunt them for you.

## The genetic material you spliced into Nomak -- Where did you get it?
I should think that would be obvious at this point.

## And why is that?
Revenge. That's what Nomak wanted all along. To pay back the people who created him.

## You got something in mind, Blade?
Ultra-rapid detox. They use it on heroin addicts, make 'em go cold-turkey in one night.

## What's going on?
He was here. Watching us.

## Nomak?
He wants us to know he's hunting us now.

## So that's down and dirty. Got anything to say for yourself?
Two things. One, I was on to you the moment they turned you. And two -- I switched that dud of yours back with the real one.

## Well you've got it, warmblood. Now what the fuck are you gonna do with it?
Oh yeah? Like how little? In case you hadn't noticed, we lost two men while you were out farting around.

## What the fuck you doing?
Ain't nobody here but you and me, chicken wing. I'd say this is as good a time as any to settle up.

## Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato. Where did he learn that?
From his father, of course.

## You experimented on your own, son?
We're locked in.

## Yes?
They've made contact with the Reapers.

## Any casualties?
Two so far.

## I see from your questionnaire that you don't have any immediate next of kin?
Not that I'm in contact with.

## No -- Does that mean I can't be a donor?
It depends. We came up with some unusual results on your blood test.

## Scud.
Us? What are you talking about?

## Whatever -- What'd you do to the Charger?
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.

## Look, what's your problem?
Our operation?! Our operation?! I built this operation, you fucking turd stain.

## The hell are you fiddling with there?
Tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the collimated beam, wanna concentrate the light, get something like a UV laser going.

## Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
Nope. Back then we did not.

## So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
Going on twenty years now.

## Blade doesn't talk about anything much. What about you, though?
After last night? Dude, I'm a lover, not a fighter.

## Are we bringing home strays now?
She's been bitten.

## What took you so long?
Don't even start, old man.

## I know. Just be quick about it, will you? Do it right.
Going somewhere?

## How can you be out here?
Take him.

## This is an old tongue, from an old world. It concerns LaMagra.
Is something wrong, my friend?

## Who is LaMagra?
The vampire God. This speaks of His return.

## How do I stop it?
Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us.

## And you honestly expect me to believe all this?
I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --

## How did you know?
Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.

## And that's a good thing?
For some. Live forever, never get old. The ultimate high.

## I know this place -- it's a blood bank.
What are you looking at?

## There are worse things than vampires out there.
How can you tell?

## Like what?
Like me.

## Nothing that won't heal by dawn.
What is this place?

## What am I injecting you with?
Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute.

## Is he sick?
Cancer.

## You care about him, don't you?
We've got a good arrangement, that's all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use them, the vampires die -- end of story.

## You make it sound like I'm already dead.
Any progress?

## Is it bad?
We get out of this alive, maybe I'll take that miracle cure of yours.

## Yes you will. The human side of you is stronger. I know it is.
What are you talking about?

## How's it going, Kam?
You're a week early.

## How could you be a part of this?
These are my people now. I'm one of them.

## I don't know -- Look at this blood smear --
Then what is it?

## What about the chemistry panel?
Curtis, it's three in the morning. I'm really not in the mood for one of your practical jokes.

## I thought you promised to give me some distance?
This is purely professional curiosity, Karen, I swear.

## You haven't started in on the internal organs?
Just the blood sample from the pericardial sac.

## What happens then?
LaMagra --

## Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace -- silver nitrate, essence of garlic.
Who better to usher in the Blood Tide?

## So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
We keep in radio contact.

## You've been listening in the whole time?
We weren't sure we could trust you.

## Which is why you're here. We could use someone with your experience.
What happens if he doesn't take the serum?

## Why do you hunt them?
I didn't. He was cruel enough to let me live. Even gave me a souvenir to remember him by.

## Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and I'm not getting any younger, am I?
I wouldn't go in there if I were you. It's best to leave him alone when he's like this.

## All right, let's start with the basics -- why do vampires need to drink blood?
Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.

## Then vampirism is a genetic defect, just like Hemolytic anemia?
Basically you'd have to re-write the victim's DNA, alter it so that the DNA will produce proteins capable of generating hemoglobin.

## How?
Then we're back to square one, aren't we? Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.

## What happened to the power?
Because it means the tree is older than the house.

## What do you mean?
A coward too. That's why she had to go.

## My eye, is there something in my eye?
Not that I can see.

## --my God, Nick?
Yes.

## What're you doing there?
Trying to find the energy.

## Inside the grave?
To stand up--I'm exhausted. Been on the road since yesterday.

## I just wanna go home.
Sometimes. Where are we going?

## Why?
Any number of reasons--pick one, it's as good as the other.

## Why are we here?
She e-mailed me yesterday this is where we should meet her.

## What's she look like?
No idea, just talked to her on the 'Net--she's very good.

## --how old?
I dunno, probably right up there, based on her resume.

## Druid Hill Park.
Oak?

## That's a joke?
That's its name. A pastoral glade gamboling with crackheads and homeless and averaging at least one homicide a week.

## What?
That's not whatzername--it's Mary Brown.

## You sure?
Yes.

## What is this?
The rest of the family was crazy as Rusty Parr.

## Your parents didn't have a bigger one?
It was free--I recall that was the chief selling point for you.

## Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
You feel no need to get married or anything.

## I don't know.
What?

## Baby names?
I don't know. Nightmare.

## You want me to scooch over next to you?
Yes.

## We've looked at half of one tape.
And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?

## For once could you just sit down, shut up, and give something a chance?
Sleep.

## Just now?
No.

## What'd you dream?
Little boys. Looking up my skirt as I danced. Giggling.

## Beta Cam's still coming back tomorrow, right?
Absolutely.

## This is what you wanted enhanced?
Yeah.

## You mind me asking, why the fuck?
The, uh, blur there.

## You want a hand?
I want amphetamines.

## Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
I don't know yet.

## What? That made her lose the baby?
Something. Someone.

## Does it hurt?
Like hell. Play the goddamn tape.

## Can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big?
I'm the ebay Boy, remember? I can't exactly afford that kind of equipment.

## Can't you like just divine it?
So lemme see it.

## From-the-movie-Mary-Brown, Trailer Park Bible Psycho?
Oh, for chrissake, she was an actor.

## Why does everyone here but me have have a gigantic stick up their ass?
Nice tent.

## So where the hell am I going to sleep?
If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.

## What movies?
Ask me what I don't have.

## What?
Three people, two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.

## Yeah?
No fucking.

## Hey, I got a whole editing suite in my loft--more the fucking merrier.
What're you, crazy?

## What about night?
Not a great idea. Especially 'cross the street.

## What?
Get inside quick, they'll stop.

## Too busy eating us?
Just go.

## Where is it?
My room, asleep, last I checked.

## Fire escape?
Don't have one.

## Where?
--I don't know.

## Who?
Doesn't say--it's just these pages.

## What?
The wheel.

## Cotter?
I'm not finished.

## You drive, I'll handle the video, okay?
Fine.

## What're you doing?
This isn't about us.

## Was it every day or just semi- weekly you got your ass kicked as a kid?
Now you can bring the vehicle to a stop, there on the left.

## What?
Look over there.

## How're the cameras doing?
Due for a re-load and battery check. I'll get on it.

## --I dunno, I just woke up--
Spite.

## Sorry, I didn't think we were making that much noise.
Just one lock in this neighbor- hood?

## It's not a real \"funny\" time for us, okay?
Well, she's got to be somewhere here.

## How much of that stuff you guys been smoking?
Enough to keep sane.

## Chrissake, why any of this?
One of the printers.

## Maybe whatever they are, they just haven't appeared yet on her?
Ruins of the Rustin Parr house.

## Oooh. Oooh.
Why?

## You planning on sleeping out there?
Not planning on sleeping at all.

## What?
Why she kills children.

## What's that?
Hmm? I dunno. Chafing from the backpack, something.

## What'd you see?
Motion. Stop there. Play it again.

## For a blur?
There is something there--don't ask, just trust me.

## What is it you thought you saw on that tape?
Still working on it.

## Are you alright?
....I don't know.

## What?
That's the reason.

## It touched me, don't you see it now?
Sure. I'm sorry.

## What're you afraid's going to happen?
That they'll start touching us inside our heads.

## What?
Domini's the only logical explanation.

## Does she, goddamnit?
His daughter, for God's sake-- I need to know if he's heard from her this morning.

## She wants me to talk to you, Heather.
....Ma'am?

## Who is this?
Your mother's pastor.

## What happened to my Dad?
There was an accident early this morning. Another car. Your father's injuries were fatal.

## I am?
You're gonna keep an eye on Marty and Ray, make sure nothing happens.

## It won't?
Thanks, Meurice.

## What?! Did Ray tell you that?
Yeah.

## What was that?
Your husband.

## Why d'you wanna leave all this?
You kidding? I don't wanna leave all this, I just wanna leave Marty...

## ...Drive me to a motel?
You can stay at my place, I'll drop you there.

## Where... where you going?
See a guy.

## On the phone. Was it for you?
I don't know, he didn't say anything.

## You got a girl--am I screwing something up by being here?
...I can find a place tomorrow, then I'll be outta your hair.

## If that's what you want to do, then you oughta do it. You, uh... you want the bed or the couch?
Well... the couch would be all right...

## ...Huh?
Yeah, he told me once himself. He said to me...

## Yeah? What happened?
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.

## What'd he say?
Nothing. He's like you, he doesn't say much.

## ...You ever get tired?
Huh? Oh, yeah, I guess. Mm-hmm.

## Ray?... What time is it?
I don't know. It's early... I love you.

## ...You all right?
You're bad.

## ...What?
I said you're bad.

## I didn't think I could sleep. I'm surprised you could. Are you all right?
Yeah...

## What happened?--Was Meurice there?
Yeah.

## Well... what happened?
I cleaned it all up, but that ain't important...

## What the hell happened, Ray?
...That's what's important.

## ...Who?
Marty.

## ...What's going on with you two?
All right...

## ...Where is everything?
In the trunk.

## Isn't that what you want?
...But first I gotta know what happened.

## What do you want to know?
You broke into the bar. You wanted to get your money. You and Marty had a fight. Something happened...

## ...So?
I think someone's watching.

## If he does come in I'm not here... What were you drinking, Debra?
Remy.

## Listen, I got tickets for the Oilers and the Rams next week in the Astrodome. Ever sat on the fifty yard line?
I don't follow baseball.

## So how long have you know Meurice?
About ten years.

## ...So what're you doing tonight?
I own the place.

## And how many room got TV, Dusty?
Ever durned one.

## Lubbock?
...He gave me a little pearl-handled .38 for out first anniversary.

## ...I don't know. Sometimes I think there's something wrong with him. Like maybe he's sick? Mentally?... Or is it maybe me, do you think?
Listen, I ain't a marriage counselor. I don't know what goes on, I don't wanna know... But I like you. I always liked you...

## I'll figure something out... How come you offered to drive me in this mess?
I told you. I like you.

## ...You know that car?
No.

## What's the matter?
I don't know... I just think maybe I'm making a mistake...

## Back where?
Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.

## Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?
I don't particularly want to talk to you.

## Then what'd you come here for?
What do you mean...

## You called me, I knew they were there, so what do I need these for?
Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit.

## How long did you watch her?
Most of the night...

## ...Anything else?
Yeah, don't come by here any more. If I need you again I know which rock to turn over.

## ...Gee, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what you want me to do or is it a secret?
Listen, I'm not--this isn't a joke here.

## What do you think?
You're an idiot.

## ...What?
Go down to Corpus for a few days. Get yourself noticed. I'll give you a call when it's done... You just find a way to cover that money.

## Ya catch any fish?
Yeah...

## Listen, what is it? Is it done?
Just the ten thousand'll be fine.

## Dead, huh?
So it would seem.

## ...What did you do with the bodies?
It's taken care of. The less you know about it the better.

## Something I got to ask you, Marty. I've been very very careful. Have you been very very careful?
Of course.

## Nobody knows you hired me?
...I just made a call about that. It'll look fine.

## Right.
Has Ray come in yet?

## What's this?
What.

## What's the point?
The point is we don't serve niggers here.

## ...I thought you were dead. Going home?
No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.

## Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
Meurice...

## Is Marty here?
Not here tonight. Wasn't here last night. He's especially not back in his office.

## ...Why?
You shouldn't have taken the money...

## Where was I?
Tuesday.

## What?
Tuesday night is ladies' night. All your drinks are free.

## Yeah. How's Dad?
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.

## Jeffrey. you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
No. I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.

## Doctor Gynde. my whole family's sick. What's going on?
I'm not sick.

## Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.

## Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
I've seen a few.

## Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
Darling, where are the glasses?. Oh. here they are.

## Are you Detective Williams?
Yes.

## You did? A human ear?
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.

## Yes?
If you want to come up a minute, I'll show you some pictures.

## These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
Okay.

## Anything you can tell me?
The criminals are winning.

## Is that why you say it's horrible?
Yes.

## Why do you do it?
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.

## What is this? What color is it?
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.

## What color is it?
It's blue. blue velvet.

## Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.

## Is Sandy part of this?
No. not at all.

## Who knows you have these?
Only you. and the photo lab.

## You're all through with this now?
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.

## Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Not yet.

## Oh my God. Is her son OK?
Hello, baby.

## Who's this fuck?
He's a friend. from the neighborhood. we were just talking.

## Where are we going, Frank?
Hey. Tits. I'm taking your neighbor to the country. maybe something for you too.

## You want to see him too, right?
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.

## Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
Those are my breasts.

## Can I feel 'em?
If you want to.

## Frank gone?
Yeah. but get outta here. He's comin' back.

## He's comin' back?. What for?
Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.

## Oh he forced you, huh?
No way. get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.

## Yes? What is it?
Pest control. gotta do your apartment.

## Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
Jeffrey nothing.

## You tell me!! Let me see that wallet. Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
I wanted to see you.

## What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
Nobody.

## That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
Well.

## THEN WHAT?
Then you got undressed.

## How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
Never before this.

## What do you want from me?
I . I don't know.

## Do you like that?
Yes.

## Do you like talk like that?
No.

## Nothing. Are you alright?
Sure I'm alright.

## Don?
No.

## Do you like the way I feel?
Yes.

## See my breasts? . See?
Yes.

## See my nipples?
Yes.

## Do you like me?
Yes, I like you.

## Do you know?
No.

## No. What is happening?
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.

## Hi. can I come in?
Yeah. hurry up though.

## Frank? .can you stand up?
I'm alright. go hide. This won't take long. Be quiet.

## Nice guy. Who's he?
Who's it, you mean.

## Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway?. Why are you in so much trouble?
Look.

## Don?. Are you in with them?
No. But you're in very big trouble.

## Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. you like me, huh?
No. how could he?. Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay. . don't hate me.

## Do you like my body?
Sure I do.

## What do you want to do?
I'm doing it.

## Whatiya mean?
Do you want to do bad things? Anything. anything.

## What do you want?
I want you to hurt me.

## You like to open me. don't you?
Yes.

## That wouldn't be too good, would it?
Frank would open you.

## Does that scare you?
Shut up.

## Look, snap out of it, will ya?
Kiss me.

## Do you love me?
I asked first.

## You. what?
You put your disease in me. your semen. it's hot and full of disease.

## I did. are you?
Yes.

## What?
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.

## Hold me, Don.
Who, Dorothy?

## We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.

## Yeah. I guess I did. What's going to happen to me?
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.

## No thanks. what does that mean?
I don't want to go.

## Go where?
On a ride.

## What?
Let's take our neighbor out. Let him fuckin' walk back.

## What are you lookin' at?
Nothing.

## Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes. pour the fuckin' beer.

## Yeah, how did you know?
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.

## You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
Yeah I did. treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.

## No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
Yes.

## How is Central these days?
Terrible. boring.

## Yeah. What are you doing now?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.

## The ear is from a missing person maybe?
Maybe so.

## I guess you have to get back home soon?
Not really, why? You want to see the building?. Come on, I'll show you.

## Where are they?
I don't know. you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you.

## Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case.

## Yeah, I guess so. What are you going to do now that you're home?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.

## What happened to him?
I don't know. he moved away.

## You hungry or thirsty, or both?
I don't know.

## I'm here, aren't I?
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.

## What will I say when she comes to the door?
I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.

## Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
Oh bother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.

## Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.

## Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
I owe you. since I goofed up this one.

## You didn't goof it up, but. you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday. do you have a date tonight?
Yes. I do.

## You really want to do this, don't you?
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.

## Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.

## Why not?
It's crazy and dangerous. My God. I shouldn't have told you.

## It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
Yeah. but.

## Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay?
O.K.

## Oh, okay. can I call?
Okay. yeah, call.

## Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
Yeah.

## I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
Okay. thanks.

## That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay?
Okay, okay. Bye.

## Well, how did it go?. What happened?
Well. I've found out some things. nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.

## What's with Mike?
He got a little jealous.

## You want a Dairy Queen?
No way. I'm about to blow up.

## Wow. Should you tell my father?
I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.

## Twice. without her sensing anything?
Yes.

## Did you see her undressed?
Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.

## Who, me? Why should it?
That's what I thought.

## Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world.?
Yeah I guess so. You're a neat girl.

## I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
Okay. be careful.

## Can I give you a kiss good night?
You better not, Jeffrey.

## You want to go talk to him?
Yeah, but. I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.

## That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Shoot.

## Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
Nothing really, but it's interesting. they know each other. they seem to like each other.

## Oh yeah?
Jeffrey!!

## I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
Yeah.

## Jeffrey?. Why?
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. and it's all secret.

## You like mysteries that much?
Yeah. you're a mystery. I like you. very much.

## You worry about me really?
Yes. is that so surprising?. Yeah I worry. a lot. I got you into this.

## You didn't tell him about me?
No.

## What is it?
Just some fatherly advice.

## What was that all about?
Nothing. really! It's good to see you.

## Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.

## Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
I like that idea. that's a real good idea.

## You want to dance?
I can't dance fast.

## Really. you want to dance with someone else?
NO.

## You want to dance?
Okay.

## Dorothy Vallens?
Yes.

## Probably not. no. Why?
OK. Let's get her over to your father's.

## Are you feeling okay?
uh uh.

## How ya doin' Dad?
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.

## Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
This is it.

## What time are visiting hours?
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10,30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.

## Yeah?
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.

## What?
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.

## Do you want the car?
No, I'm just gonna walk around.

## Can I use the car tonight?
Of course, Jeffrey.

## Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
Nothing. I'm fine.

## Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?

## Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.

## Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Alright.

## Would you like a piece of cake?
No. No thank you.

## Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?

## Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.

## What are watchin' this junk for?
You can change it if you want to.

## Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?
Sure. just a sec. Excuse me.

## Come on out a minute, okay?
Okay.

## QUIET! Callate! Where's Diego?
I don't know. He sent me. I'm George.

## Where do you guys want to count?
On the plane.

## What plane? We going someplace? Where we headed? You have your money. It's all there. What the fuck is going on?
Pleased to meet you finally, George. I am Augusto Oliveras.

## What?
Let us walk. From what I understand, Diego has bought a hundred and sixty acres, a marina, a hotel, and an airstrip.

## He what?
Yes. Jack Stevens is already a very busy man. Along with many others. You shouldn't stay away so long.

## That's impossible. We can't be up and running. Who's distributing?
No. I have the space. I figured it out. This is what I want to do.

## This is a one time thing, Gusto. One and I'm out. Give me a good price for old time's sake. What do you think?
I'm so glad you two could make it. Mirtha, look at you. So beautiful. You look like you're about to burst.

## Thanks. I am. Where's Martha?
I don't know. Drunk somewhere. Try the bar. And if you find her, tell her to come, it's almost midnight.

## Que va hacer?
Que queres decir. Que es lo que el va hacer? Pues, no va hacer nada.

## Are you sure this guy is cool?
You'll see for yourself.

## What is?
Just everything. You. California. The beach. This spot right here. I feel like I belong here, you know? It just feels right.

## You happy, baby?
Yeah. I am.

## Are you sure this guy is cool?
You'll see for yourself.

## What is?
Just everything. You. California. The beach. This spot right here. I feel like I belong here, you know? It just feels right.

## You happy, baby?
Yeah. I am.

## Are you kidding?
We'll take it.

## You wanna split?
Yeah, I don't feel so well.

## Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you?
No, not at all. Sure. You're right. You fly home and get some rest.

## What, and miss all the fun? C'mon, not a chance. So, what's the verdict?
Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years. I'll serve two.

## What? You're not going to wait for me?
George, I went to the doctor. I don't have two years.

## Mr. Jung, you're a convicted felon, correct?
Yes, I am.

## Do you have any agreement or understanding whatsoever with the United States government in regards to your testimony?
No, I cam here out of my own volition.

## Excuse me?
Something about vengance being best served cold.

## So you do have an agreement with the United States Government, Mr. Jung, correct?
Not so fast. I would like to go over the details.

## Hmm. I see. Will there be clothes in the suitcase?
What? Yeah, sure.

## I see. How much?
Padrino will pay ten-thousand per kilo. For everyone. For you, and you, and you.

## What can I do for you guys?
We want some grass.

## I know what you want. But, first of all, are you cops?
No.

## We're not cops. We're from Massachusettes. I mean, does he look like a cop?
I guess not. Okay. You know, you're very lucky you're friends of Barbie's. If you weren't, I'd never talk to you.

## What the fuck is that?
It's your grass.

## What can I do for you guys?
We want some grass.

## I know what you want. But, first of all, are you cops?
No.

## We're not cops. We're from Massachusettes. I mean, does he look like a cop?
I guess not. Okay. You know, you're very lucky you're friends of Barbie's. If you weren't, I'd never talk to you.

## What the fuck is that?
It's your grass.

## And I only deal with you?
Barbara and me. No one else.

## Are you sure you want to do this in front of everyone?
Don't be ridiculous, these are my babies.

## Sell it?
Half a million for you. Half a million for me. One-point-three five for the Colombians.

## Not bad for a weekend's work, huh?
It's nothing personal, George. Just business.

## You?
For calling you a homo.

## Christ almighty, George. Feed her a cheeseburger or something. What does she weight, eighty pounds?
I know. She needs to slow down. She's going to blow an O-ring.

## What's that?
Get me a six pack.

## Your offense? Why are you here?
I don't want to talk about it.

## Intriguing. I see. Would you like to know my crime?
Not really, no.

## No?
I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego.

## What do you got there, Diego?
Nothing. Just a little project.

## What kind of project?
Never mind. Not for you to worry.

## What's the other one?
I never believed you were a murderer. I knew. I knew you are a magico. I have seen it in you. It's in your spirit.

## Yes, you have a dream. And maybe you accomplish your dream. But yet you failed. Why?
Because I got caught.

## Because they caught me?
You failed because you had the wrong dream.

## George? What do you know about cocaine?
No, no. That is where you are wrong. For us, it is cheap. In Medellin, we buy for six-thousand dollars a kilo. IN Miami, we sell for sixty.

## What type of planes do you have?
Four passenger, single engine Cessna.

## I don't know. A hundred, hundred and fifty. How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?
Fifteen hundred. We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.

## Allo?
Diego? It's George.

## George, hallo! Today is the day, ah? Are you out?
Yeah, I'm out.

## How are we doing?
Perfect, George. Perfect. Everything is fine down here. Everything is all set up.

## Do we need a plane? How does this work? When do I see you?
Slow down, George. Slow down.

## George, are we gonna do this or not?
Good to see you, Diego.

## What's the matter, George?
What's the matter? We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.

## And what happens when these guys stop paying? Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out. Then where are we?
That's my George, always thinking.

## Jesus Christ, George, I don't see you in two years, and you show up at my door with a hundred and ten pounds of cocaine?
Just sell it, Derek.

## What the fuck is going on? When did you get out of jail?
Yeah. Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.

## Right. Now who is the person in California? The connection?
Just a friend.

## Where do I put this!?
Try the back bedroom.

## Are you comfortable with this?
And keep only forty-percent? No thanks.

## I'm married, George. Me. I can't believe it. Can you believe I'm married, George?
You're a lucky man, Diego.

## I love you, my brother, do you know that?
I love you too, man.

## Three years. How long have we been in business? Three years. Does she get to meet your connection? Was she good enough?
Shut up, Diego. They're going to be here any minute. I'm trying to concentrate.

## What do you need my connection for, Diego? What are you going to do with it?
What do I do with it? Nothing. It's for peace of mind. It's for the principle.

## I'm driving you crazy? No. You're driving me crazy. We had a dream. What happened to our dream?
Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up.

## George, I am happy to see you. How are you, my brother?
No more brothers, Diego.

## He's in tachycardia. George, your heart is racing. Have you been using drugs?
Coke.

## Cocaine? How much?
I don't know. Maybe eighteen grams.

## In how long? A week?
Today.

## Surprised to see me?
Take your boots off. You're tan.

## Thank you. Have you been getting the money I sent you?
You mean the drug money? Yes, I got it.

## Okay, Mom. It's okay. Where's Dad?
It's a family heirloom.

## Who's the cheapskate?
You, you big old tightwad. He still has his communion money. Tell him, George. Tell your father about layaway.

## So, this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day?
Actually, it was three.

## Un sapo?
Yes.

## So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George?
Yes, sir. As much as you can give me.

## People tell me that I am crazy. That my business will never work in your country. What do you think, George?
What do I think? I don't want my answer to be influenced by what I want, so I'm going to have to say I don't know.

## Yes. I do not know, either. What do you want, George?
I want money.

## Yes. Money. Which is what, George?
Freedom.

## Power?
Yeah, maybe.

## Beautiful girls?
Keep them coming.

## And Diego?
Diego is my brother.

## Diego?
Yeah.

## You're saying life will take care of Diego?
Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you. It is the teacher.

## Yeah, well, what are you gonna do? You and me, Pablo? Are we good?
Of course, George. We are beautiful. We are brothers. Real brothers. Not like Diego. We started this, George.

## What are you going to do?
I'm going to California.

## What are you going to do?
I'm going to California.

## Yeah, Dad. I really did. What am I gonna do?
Tough spot.

## You mad at me?
Not mad.

## No, it's good. You have a family. It's good if it makes you happy. It's nice to have nice things. Are you happy, son?
Yeah, Dad. I'm happy right now.

## You're not going to trial?
No.

## Give this to Mom, will you?
Money. You and your mother. All the time chasing it. I never understood it.

## Yeah, I know. This is it, isn't it?
Tell Mom, you know...

## That was a good one, Dad. That was really something. Remember that?
That was a beautiful message.

## What the fuck? Is he going to walk?
He's going down, George. It's election year. We're not making any deals.

## Figured what out?
You know how we were wondering what we were going to do for money? Being how we don't want to get jobs and whatnot? Well, check this out.

## It's oregano. You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this?
George.

## Figured what out?
You know how we were wondering what we were going to do for money? Being how we don't want to get jobs and whatnot? Well, check this out.

## It's oregano. You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this?
George.

## What the fuck are you talking about, man?
The set-up is wrong. We're doing all the legwork, and at the end of the day, we're still paying retail. We're getting middled.

## Source? What about Derek?
He's getting middled, too. And Derek's our partner. What's good for us is good for him.

## Do I know you?
I don't think so.

## Why are you smiling?
I don't know. My name is George.

## What is your name?
You better know what you're doing, George. You're playing with fire.

## Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I?
Put that shit away, they're here.

## Pablo said no?
Look, Mirtha. She's walking.

## Where are you going?
Out.

## Don't touch me. Tell me. Just answer the question. What do I spend? What? How will we live?
Not in front of the kid.

## Hey, why don't you just put a \"I'm doing cocaine\" sign on the car. What is your fucking problem?
My problem? We're broke, that's my fucking problem. And you're a fucking spy.

## What?
You should have taken better care of me, you know? You've been away a long time. Four years. Say something.

## You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?
Yeah. She told me. You walk her to school.

## Hey, George. You okay?
Yeah. I'm fine. I'm good.

## Mirtha, what's going on? Everything okay with Kristina?
Kristina's fine.

## Is she here? George, Kristina hates you. You fucked her over one too many times. And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?
George, he wasn't asking.

## Mirtha, how are you doing?
Better than you.

## What's happening to us?
I don't know.

## What are you doing here?
Nothing. I just wanted you to know I was out. I just wanted to see you.

## How are you doing?
George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay.

## What?
You can call me Dad if you want.

## What do you want from me?
Just to walk with you. I want to be your dad again.

## You mean, like a trip?
Yeah, sure, whatever.

## California? You can go anywhere in the world. India. Tibet. Australia. Paris. And you choose California?
Yeah.

## What is it? A Disneyland thing?
No. I just kind of like the sound of it.

## California, huh?
California.

## Bye, Dad. See you in the morning, okay?
I'll be here.

## Where are you going?
I don't know. Maybe California.

## You swear?
You know I can't. Mom will never let me go.

## You swear?
That's right. Three o'clock. Thursday. At your mother's. You and me. It's a date.

## Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado?
Yes, I do.

## Do you see him here in the courtroom?
Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.

## Mr. Jung, can you describe the circumstances of how you began talking about cocaine with Mr. Delgado?
It's a four-man operation. Two on the ground. Two in the air.

## Who's the co-pilot?
Sounds fine. I'll need to meet everybody.

## For instance, something like this?
Very nice. I'll take it.

## Ha ha ha. You are funny. Really, how much will you be needing?
All of it. As much as you've got. A couples thousand pounds. I'll be back in a week with a plane.

## What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars? Would that eliminate some of your concerns?
Amigo, you bring me fifty-thousand dollars, and I have no more concerns.

## Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
I'm on vacation. On my way back to school.

## This calls for a joint. You want to do the honors?
No, man. I'm too fucked up.

## Stoned?
I wish there was shit like this back home.

## Yeah?
When there's something to move, it's too easy not to. Do you know how many colleges are in a twenty mile radius? U. Mass, Amherst, B.U....

## So?
So, we need to get to the source.

## Not that far, only halfway. You sure you know what you're doing?
Holy shit, Dulli!

## Nice weed, huh?
Fuck yeah. I never seen nothing like it. I'm fucking wasted.

## No shit, Kevin?
That's right.

## And you believe the NLF?
They seemed to be plausible this time. A general strike is a good argument for the UN.

## Dien Bien Phu?
Exactly.

## And here?
It depends on you.

## I understand. What's your question?
The questions have already been asked. I would only like some precise answers, that's all ...

## Which \"district\" do you belong to?
Second district ... Explain better ...

## Third group. What's your assignment?
Uh ... responsible for the sixth section.

## You afraid of these ...?
Don't move, Hacene.

## Why are you afraid? We've always been friends. One might even say that I brought you up ... Isn't it true, Ali?
It's true.

## What's happened to you?
The NLF has condemned you to death.

## How much are they paying you?
They're not paying me anything. They've already warned you twice; this is the last warning. Decide.

## With an unloaded pistol?
I'll explain.

## And how many are we?
Not enough.

## Why? Isn't he sleeping here?
No, it's better if he doesn't. The house is filled with new people.

## Can you read?
Sure ...

## Where's Kader?
With the others. They are trying to stop the people.

## What do you think of the strike, Ali?
I think it'll be a success ...

## Yes, I think so too ... It's been organized well ... But what will the French do?
It's clear. They'll do everything possible to make it fail.

## Why?
Because they told us that we mustn't use weapons, now, when the time is right.

## Good evening ... Can we pass?
It's too late. No one is allowed to enter the Casbah at this hour. It's impossible.

## Where were we?
Intersection, between Consular Street and General Laquiere Avenue ...

## Tell me ... Where is this rue de Thbes?
Rue de Thbes? In the Upper Casbah, I think ...

## A name?
Yes, a name for the operation.

## Why?
You seem to be very satisfied to have taken me alive ...

## What is she saying?
She says that Ali is still in the Casbah.

## Who is speaking?
Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.

## How can I give you this statement?
We'll lower a basket from the window ...

## Are you ready, colonel?
Yes ... But let me first see you.

## Fine, Charlie. You familiar with the Marsh case?
It could've happened to anyone.

## So -- where do we start?
Before you ask there's nothing new on the coke.

## You got something on the coke?
No -- but I got something.

## So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?
It's very good -- because when the D.A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.

## Why?
Because it hasn't all been erased.

## Right now. Guess who's been buying Coke from him for the last five and half years?
Joanne Braslow is getting more and more interesting. I followed her today to an attorney's office. Joseph Koehler.

## What good does that do -- it's the old will?
She kills the old man and makes it look like Miss Lawson did it. Pretty slick.

## You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?
I don't know.

## For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?
Because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime.

## What did he say about Miss Lawson?
He can remember at least one occasion -- and the receptionist can recall two times when she accompanied Marsh to the office.

## What about the will?
That's the best part. She gets it all -- everything.

## How?
Yeah.

## Cause?
Not sure. I'll have everything you need tomorrow.

## What'd he die of?
The official cause of death was a cardiac arrest.

## The official cause?
That's what my report will read.

## What are you saying, Henry? That his girlfriend fucked him to death?
Yes.

## Any prints on the nasal spray?
Cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want.

## Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of death?
A massive cardiac arrest.

## What was Mr. Marsh's physical condition prior to his death?
Very poor. He was suffering from severe arterial disease.

## Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?
No.

## What induced it?
We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.

## So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?
I don't think so. The membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage.

## Is this the bottle that was found on the nightstand?
Yes.

## Your Honor, the State enters this evidence as exhibit A. Were any fingerprints found on the bottle?
Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's.

## Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?
Increase his heart rate.

## -- And if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine?
It would be an added stress to his heart.

## What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?
It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.

## Mrs. Crawford, you were Mr. Marsh's maid for nine years?
Yes.

## Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
Like cats and dogs.

## Did they argue the day before he died?
Well -- he died on a Sunday and I have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels Friday afternoon.

## What was the nature of the argument?
Sex.

## Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use cocaine?
No -- never.

## Why didn't the State's investigation uncover Mr. Roston earlier?
He was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago.

## Did Miss Lawson ever give you any indication why she was leaving?
No questions.

## Lookin' to make the papers, John?
You can't show intent.

## Can you?
Take your pole out of the water, Frank. The fish ain't biting today.

## C'mon -- think about it. If she was going to kill Marsh why leave the nasal spray bottle there for the police to find?
She planned this. She wanted us to find the nasal spray.

## Why would she want that?
Suspicions maybe -- but suspicions aren't enough for a conviction.

## Then she's not as smart as I thought she was. You've seen her in the depositions. Tell me you don't have any doubts?
She's innocent.

## Aren't they all?
Yeah. Well -- we'll let the blindfolded lady with the scales decide that.

## Her. It's an obvious move. I'm building a case against her, remember?
Objection! Mr. Roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial.

## Miss Lawson, do you use cocaine?
I have.

## Did you use it the night Marsh died?
No. I haven't done it in years.

## Were you aware of Mr. Marsh's heart condition?
No.

## Miss Braslow -- I'm District Attorney John Cardenas. You arrived at what time tonight?
A little after eleven.

## Why did you come by?
I had some papers to pick up.

## Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?
I assume his girlfriend.

## Her name?
Rebecca Lawson.

## You wouldn't know her address, would you?
No -- but I can get it for you.

## How long were you Mr Marsh's personal secretary?
Six years.

## Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use Cocaine?
No -- never.

## What about Miss Lawson?
Yes.

## Did you see Mr. Marsh the day before his death?
Yes.

## How did he look?
Horrible. He was tired and pale.

## Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
Yes.

## Is it Marsh?
Yeah.

## Who found him?
His Secretary. Joanne Braslow.

## She was here?
No. She stopped by to pick up some papers.

## Doctor Trammel, when did you first diagnose that Mr. Marsh had heart disease?
About a year and half ago.

## Did Mr. Marsh change his lifestyle after that?
Yes -- he stopped smoking and drinking and exercised regularly.

## He did everything he could to take care of his heart?
Yes.

## Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh to your office?
Yes.

## Just one last question. What does the sign on your office door say?
Doctor Steven Trammel. Cardiologist.

## Mr. Roston, what was your relationship with Miss Lawson?
We were lovers.

## How long were you together?
For about one year.

## How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
Intense.

## What kind of condition are you referring to?
I had a bad heart.

## What happened next?
I had bypass surgery.

## And how are you now?
Fine. The doctors say if I keep taking care of myself I can live to be a very old man.

## How did your relationship with Miss Lawson progress after the surgery?
It didn't.

## Why not?
She left me.

## Why did she say she was leaving?
She didn't. She just left.

## Why do you think she left you?
Well -- I think that after the operation she realized that...

## When you say your sexual relations with Miss Lawson were intense what exactly do you mean?
It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could. She called it opening new doors.

## Can you give the court an example?
It was like sex was a game to her. She got off on the control. She always used to tell me it had to be her way.

## What would she do that made it hard to resist?
She told me that tonight we were going to open new doors. I asked her to stop -- to take off the handcuffs, but she wouldn't listen.

## What did she say?
Mr. Roston I know this is difficult for you, but it's important you tell the court what she did.

## If you knew it was bad for you why did you do it?
I couldn't help myself. You get lost inside a women like her. It was like a drug. It was the best sex I ever had.

## What happened after that?
I woke up the next morning and she was gone.

## Did you change your will while you were with Miss Lawson?
Yes.

## Who was your primary beneficiary?
She was.

## Where did you meet Miss Lawson?
At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.

## Did you ever see her again after that?
Yes -- several times.

## What eventually happened to your relationship with Miss Lawson?
We stopped seeing each other.

## Why?
Well -- I realized that she wasn't interested in me. She was just trying to get information out of me.

## What kind of information?
She said that she was working on a novel and she wanted to know what kinds of drugs would be harmful to someone with a bad heart.

## Did you suggest any?
Yes -- Insulin and others.

## -- And what did you suggest?
Cocaine.

## Dr. Paley, where were you the last time you saw Miss Lawson?
We had dinner at a restaurant.

## Isn't it true that later that night you tried to force yourself on Miss Lawson in the parking lot?
No.

## You didn't grab her and try to kiss her?
No.

## And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
No.

## You'll be sorry?
I was angry.

## You called him?
I'm sure that every orgasm she had with me was faked.

## Dr. Trammel, did you ever speak to Miss Lawson about Mr. Marsh's condition?
No.

## Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?
No.

## Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh inside during his examinations?
No.

## Then you have no way of knowing what Mr. Marsh told Miss Lawson were the reasons for his visits?
No. No, I don't.

## Dr. Wong -- what type of medicine do you practice?
Oriental medicine.

## --And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?
Yes. I've been seeing her for over a year.

## Why does she come to you?
She suffers from severe menstrual cramps.

## Did you ever prescribe any medication for her cramps?
Yes.

## What did you prescribe for her?
Chinese peony root.

## Would you describe for the court what Chinese peony root looks like?
It's a white powder that comes in a vial.

## How do you instruct your patients to take it?
I tell them to pour an amount the size of a quarter into the their hand and mix it with water.

## One last question, Doctor. If someone didn't know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine?
Yes -- quite easy.

## Did you go to college, Mrs. Crawford?
No.

## High school?
No.

## Then -- those are not your own words?
No.

## Miss Sellers, do you know Dr. Alan Paley?
Yes.

## Where did you meet him?
I'm a nurse. I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital. Dr. Paley's on staff there.

## Then what happened?
I realized he wasn't serious. He was seeing other women -- asking other nurses at the hospital out, so I ended it.

## -- And what did Dr. Paley do after you stopped seeing him?
He used to call me -- tell me that I couldn't just walk out on him. He said that if I didn't come back he'd make my life miserable.

## Did he make your life miserable?
Yes -- he did.

## What did he say?
He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over.

## What happened?
There was an inquiry. It was his word against mine. They believed him. I was fired.

## You don't really believe what the district attorney is saying about Miss Lawson, do you?
I don't know. It's incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that -- but if anyone could it would be Rebecca.

## I take it you don't like Miss Lawson very much?
I really don't know her that well. We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house, but that was about it.

## Did Mr. Marsh use drugs?
No.

## What about Miss Lawson?
Yes -- cocaine.

## Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
Yes-- It was on a Friday. I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday. It would be October twenty-eighth.

## Could you repeat the last part of what Mr. Marsh said to you the day before his death?
He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him. That his heart couldn't take it.

## Didn't Mr. Marsh also tell you that Miss Lawson felt bored here and was thinking about going back to Chicago for awhile?
Yes -- he mentioned it.

## Well, think about it. Isn't it possible?
Yes. I suppose it's possible.

## Who told you that?
Yes, I slept with him but that was a long time ago.

## You've tried it? Isn't it true that you've been in and out of Rehab centers for the last four years?
I've been to a few -- yes.

## You don't like Miss Lawson much do you?
No.

## You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along. Isn't that true?
Yes.

## You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?
Yes.

## And you resented that he cared for her in a way he once cared for you?
Yes.

## --And that Mr. Marsh paid less attention to you?
Yes.

## --and that he changed his will?
Yes.

## In his previous will Mr. Marsh left you two hundred and fifty thousand dollars -- then he cut you out. Why do you think he did that?
She talked him into it. She wanted everything.

## Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money. That must have made you pretty angry?
Yes.

## There's an item you picked up that's marked. Will you read it?
Dristan nasal spray.

## Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
Three fifteen.

## A.M -- or P.M.?
P.M.

## Isn't it true that you stopped by the house after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought?
No.

## Then you would have gotten your money?
Yes.

## What do you have in your purse?
What do you think I've got? A gun? Maybe I'm gonna kill you too. Maybe I'll blow your head off right now.

## You didn't know about it before that?
No.

## Then why did you go see Mr. Koehler in the first place?
Because he called me.

## I need to ask you a question. What made you get in touch with Joanne Braslow?
You know I can't talk about that.

## I'm not asking for names or specifics. I just want to know what prompted you to make the call?
Sorry.

## And your sexual tastes were something that you hid from Miss Lawson?
Yes.

## And didn't Miss Lawson come home one day and find you in bed with your male lover?
Yes.

## Would it be fair to say that when she did find out it was a shock to her?
Yes.

## Do you think I did it?
I don't know. That's why I'm asking you.

## No pain, no gain?
Something like that.

## As it pertains to you -- not me. Did you always know you had different... tastes?
Yes.

## How?
I don't know if it's something I can explain to you.

## Why not?
Because -- it's beyond intellect. It's emotion. It's passion. It has to be experienced -- it can't be imagined.

## If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
Because -- somehow the fruit always tasted that much sweeter because of the pain it took to get to it.

## Sure. Where to?
This is your house.

## Why not?
Because, I'm your attorney. I shouldn't be going to your house.

## Is it against the law?
No -- it just doesn't look right.

## What do you think?
I think the photographer's probably a voyeur.

## Hello?
Hi. It's Frank.

## Tell me about Doctor Paley?
I hardly know him. He wanted me and he couldn't have me.

## Did you always want to be a lawyer?
No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.

## Really?
Yeah.

## That seems so far away from who you are now. What happened?
I broke my ankle skating. That ended that dream.

## It's hard to let go of a dream, isn't it? To let go of what you want?
Yes -- it would be nice.

## What would?
You and me -- making love.

## Is that what you think I was thinking?
No -- that's what I know you were thinking.

## I called you all weekend. Where were you?
I went out on the boat.

## Alone?
Of course.

## Can I see you later?
You can see me now.

## Something wrong?
Paley could be a problem tomorrow.

## Sugar or honey?
Honey.

## What's that for?
To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today.

## You killed him -- didn't you?
I knew you were thinking that. I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom. You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.

## Hello?
Frank -- It's Rebecca. I need to see you right away. I've got the tape.

## Why?
Because I told her you were the best criminal attorney we have.

## What are they saying?
The kids at school say she humped Mr. Marsh to death.

## She allegedly humped him to death?
Yeah.

## Is Mom yelling at you too?
I love you.

## Why?
Because I'm expecting a call.

## \"Discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities.\" Who told you to say that?
No, Your Honor.

## Mr. Roston?
Miss Braslow, I'd like to remind you that you are still under oath.

## Are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing?
I can back it up.

## Really?
Really.

## And I suppose you're going to show me how to relax?
If you want me to.

## Can't it wait?
No -- it has to be done by tomorrow.

## How can Cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults?
He must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard.

## If he files are you going to take the case?
I don't know yet. I want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow.

## What's she like?
Attractive. Bright. Distant. Charming when she wants to be.

## I'll talk to him later.
Yeah -- but can she cook?

## Why don't you talk to him now?
Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.

## Is that alright, Frank?
Yeah -- fine. Excuse me. I'll be right back.

## Yeah -- what are you doing up?
We have to talk.

## What's wrong?
That's what I was hoping you'd tell me.

## Where have you been?
Working. Charlie and I were going over some statements.

## Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you. You were with her, weren't you?
Yes.

## Why did you lie to me?
Because I knew you'd think exactly what you're thinking.

## You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
No.

## Why didn't you come to me?
I don't know.

## You think that's the answer? Sex? Is that what you want? You want me to make love to you?
Albert's got the stomach flu.

## Not even if they're a dork?
Not even if they're a dork. You should go by and see how he's feeling.

## What time did you leave?
Six thirty -- and he was very much alive.

## Did Marsh use it?
No -- never.

## Why are there two deeds here?
Oh, just a old letter from a friend.

## No treasure maps, huh?
No.

## Carolyn -- you want these candlesticks?
No. You can have them.

## Explain to me again why we didn't do this in Des Moines in an air conditioned office?
Mom's orders.

## Lawyer here?
I have some sandwich fixings if you're hungry.

## He dropped them off at Betty's mom. Where's Steve?
He's not coming.

## What problem?
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.

## What?
That he be cremated and his ashes thrown on Roseman Bridge.

## Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.

## This happened way before we both got married. I... I can't believe it. You think she had sex with him?
Well, I'd like to read them.

## Then why do you?
Bar across the street.

## I found out who Lucy Delaney is. Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
Yeah. But I thought she died.

## You mean -- she didn't like sex?
I bet mom could've helped her.

## Not yet. You want to go?
I think I better. Between the book and the coffee, I'm this close to raping the busboy.

## You're right -- that is sick.
Did we want to?

## No, what?
See. Money don't buy happiness. I must say, she's taking it well.

## No. What a tragedy. What happened?
She changed.

## What do you know about \"the changes\"?
I don't know. I woke up a little dizzy. I didn't sleep well. I think I need to lay down.

## No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
No, of course not. I'll just clean up.

## Are you supposed to be in Iowa?
Yeah.

## Roseman Bridge?
That's it.

## Oh, terrific. Which way?
If I'm not taking you away from anything.

## There's a wonderful smell about Iowa -- very particular to this part of the country. Do you know what I mean?
No.

## Are you from Washington originally?
Uh-huh. Lived there till I was twenty or so and then moved to Chicago when I got married.

## Oh. When did you move back?
After the divorce.

## How long you been married?
Uh... uh... Umm... long time.

## Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story! Whereabouts in Italy?
Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.

## You just... got off the train because it looked pretty?
Yeah. Excuse me a sec.

## Long. You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
Yeah.

## Would you do me a favor and go to the truck? Inside that leather bag with the pockets is a package of lens cleaners. Would you grab me one?
Oh there you are.

## Men sill give women flowers, don't they? I mean, as a sign of appreciation? I'm not that out of date, am I?
Looking for something in particular? There's not much of a selection.

## Want another cigarette?
Sure.

## Lemon?
Sure.

## Mind if I smoke?
Not at all.

## Sure you want to keep those in the house?
I'm so sorry about that. It was rude. I think I just got nervous for some reason.

## Where are you staying while you're here?
A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet.

## As long as it takes, I might stay a week. No more I don't think. Where's your family?
My husband took the kids to the Illinos State Fair. My daughter's entering a prize steer.

## Oh. How old?
About a year and a half.

## Why?
Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change.

## What's he like?
He's very... clean.

## Clean?
No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father.

## Feeling better?
Much.

## Is the dizziness gone?
I think so.

## Help cook?
Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.

## What?
She starts sniffing me.

## Then what happened?
We got engaged.

## \"Making pictures.\" I like that. You really love what you do, don't you?
I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.

## Why, do you think?
I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions.

## And did you?
I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.

## Why did you stop?
My children. And Richard didn't like my working.

## Do you miss it?
I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it.

## You're asking a man if he's too tired to talk about himself? You don't get out much, do you?
I'm sorry. That was...

## You drink bug repellent?
No, you rub it on you. I have some in the truck. Don't go away.

## You want to go back in?
No. I'm all right. It's working.

## This \"... Of what I call God and fools can Nature.\" Who wrote that?
Umm, I don't know. I can look it up.

## You sure you won't let me help you with those dishes?
No. I'll do them later.

## Are you all right?
Yes.

## What?
We're not doing anything wrong, do you.

## So what happened?
You must get lonely at times.

## Woman friends, too?
I'm a loner, I'm not a monk.

## Why doesn't it scare you?
I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.

## Do you ever regret not having a family?
Not everybody's supposed to have a family.

## But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?
I told you, I love other people.

## Do you want to leave your husband?
My mistake. I apologize.

## What made you ask such a question?
I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.

## Francesca?
Yes! Hi.

## Am I interrupting anything?
No. I was just... No.

## Yeah?
I want you to come.

## How about if I set the table?
Sure.

## Would you like a beer for your bath?
Yes, that'd be nice.

## Are you comfortable? Do you... want to move to the bedroom?
No. I can't. Not yet.

## Are you hungry?
No.

## What?
Right now. Tell me someplace you've been -- someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here.

## How about Italy?
Yes.

## How about Bari?
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.

## Have you ever been to that station?
Yes.

## Why?
Why!? Because, I'm having thoughts I hardly know what to do with. I... can't seem to... stop them.

## Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?
Near the church.

## Why do you say that?
Because I already tried once.

## I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
I had a temper.

## What were your parents like?
I can't do this, honey.

## What?
Try and live a lifetime before Friday. Cram it all in.

## You're somewhere else, where?
Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.

## Uh-huh. And?
You're right, you know. We don't have much time.

## Where was she?
Across the street. She went into the park and got turned around and didn't know her way out.

## Am I too heavy for you?
No.

## Sleep all right?
Yes, thanks.

## Well, what is this?
Well, why is that up to me? You're the one who's married. You told me you have no intention of leaving your husband.

## To do what? Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? I mean, what would be the point. Would you pass the butter?
I was honest with you. I told you who I was.

## What are you doing?
Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.

## How do you know what I experience?
Stop it!

## What do you want me to say?
If I've done anything to make you think that what's happened between us is nothing new for me -- is some routine -- then I do apologize.

## What makes it different, Robert?
No matter how I keep turning it around in my mind -- it doesn't seem like the right thing.

## For who?
Then he can move! People move!

## What about us? What about me?
You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. It'll all change.

## Mrs. Johnson! Mrs. Johnson! Is it true Cary Grant has proposed to you?
Yes. And I've accepted.

## You feeling better Franny?
Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.

## Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.

## What time is it?
Later. Go back to sleep.

## Where you going?
I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.

## Hmm. How about that brown sugar meat loaf you make?
Okay.

## Hmm?
I just want to say... I know you had your own dreams. I'm sorry I couldn't give them to you. I love you so much.

## Are you seeing Betty tonight?
Nah.

## What's her name?
Betty.

## What's she like?
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.

## Who the hell is Lucy Delaney?
Don't feed that dog.

## Then what do you care?
Take my advice. And shoot that dog. Or let me.

## Is it true?
Yeah. He lived there. And died there, too.

## How the hell should I know?
Hey, kid.

## Yeah?
Take my advice. Get the hell out of there. It's a bad place. Always has been.

## So what the hell's the good news?
Bones! How baddass is zat? This is the place for us. Patrick, you get platinum props, man. Platinum.

## What's your problem with Crippled Dick?
Look around, this place is a dump! Naw, it'd have to work to be a dump.

## Are you nuts?
Keep smokin', fool.

## S up?
Nothing. Contact paranoia. Must be buggin' from hanging with you.

## You think that's really him?
Damn. It's so...fresh.

## Can you take a little extended solo right about now, funk soul brotha?
Go for it.

## You want us to move in here?
That's the only way we'll get the place fixed up in time.

## Spooked?
No. Well, yeah. Maybe just a little.

## Where's the others?
Maurice left. Tia's taking a bath.

## You sure got a way with women, bro. What happened up there?
Damned if I know.

## Where's the gangsta of love?
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.

## Climb out to where?
Anywhere but here.

## Is this Hell?
Or just Hell-adjacent...

## That's what?
That's some terrible shit.

## Looking to score?
Unh-unh, little brother. I got a natural high. A supernatural high.

## Wh-wh-whooo?
Bones.

## Yeah, we used to do the after-school b ball at Kenwood. What it is?
What it will be.

## Must be my clothes line. No? How bout my phone line?
No baby. I'm serious. Cancel that meeting. I got more fruit that needs checking. Come home with me now.

## No? That mean there's something more left of you than just that hungry spirit? What are you going to do now? Kill us? Kill us all?
No. Not...not you. You I forgive.

## Where are we, baby?
Where we'll always be...

## Hey Jimmy, you know Eddie Mack, don't you?
We met.

## Time like this, is that what you really want to know? How I got the fuck in here?
I don't understand it. You were my Man. Since we was grasshoppas. I always looked after you. You had a piece of everything I had.

## And the hell everybody else, right?
I have to finish this for class.

## You mean as opposed to your life?
I'm sorry, Momma. Maybe next time.

## Have you ever been inside?
Maybe once upon a time. But that was long ago. Back before... before it became what it is.

## And what's that?
Just a bad place. And the doorway to worse.

## Who? Who is he? What is he?
Your father. He was your father.

## But if it's him. If he's really come back, won't he know us? Love us?
But how do you know? Maybe he just wanted to see us? And now he's gone again. And you've all killed my father for the second time.

## Aren't you gonna do something about it?
I don't. Patrick doesn't. And his brother and sister don't. And they're in the house with him.

## Are they on the radio?
Naw. But they will be. They're the best.

## How do you know?
I manage them.

## Why?
No. It goes way back. Or so my Momma says.

## What else does she say?
Nothing. You'd think she was crazy. And she is a lot of things, not all of them nice, but crazy Momma's not.

## Like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us? Fingers rotting off?
Maybe. But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.

## The dead get out?
Or the living fall in. Who knows.

## And you believe her?
If I did, I wouldn't come within fifty yards of your door.

## Cinn?
What? Oh yeah. Coming.

## I'm sure I can make your mother like me. But then do I gotta worry 'bout your father?
I can't. Not yet.

## Why couldn't you just tell him to let us in?
Back here. At the end of the block.

## You got the shit?
Yeah, but you got to come the rest of the way on foot. Leave your car and walk over here.

## Where is it?
I can't carry it in my pocket, man. And I can't go get it for you cause you might be a cop. You gonna have to pick it up yourself.

## What are we doing down here?
Sure, son. I went down there and torched the place myself.

## Why? Why did you give a shit about the building? Why did you care that we were there of all places?
It's...it's a bad neighborhood. As you can see now.

## Dad?
Help me. I'm so sorry. But please, help me...

## What the hell do you want?
Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.

## Keep your hands to yourself, willya?
I been watching you. You done good. Invested wisely. Respectable businessman now. Just like you always wanted.

## You cut him, or I shoot you. Make your choice.
What building?

## I ain't killed nobody. Shall I rack 'em? Play a game, Lupe?
No time for eightball. I got your tip.

## I'm on my way home. Can you handle it yourself?
Oh, no. Please don't make me go by myself. I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.

## No more thoughts from your asses. Or I will burn your asses and snort the ashes. Hear me?
We didn't do nothing, Eddie.

## You gon tell me you didn't ginsu those punks and steal their ride?
That's all we did, steal their ride.

## Then how'd you hear it, fool?
It was just like in my head.

## You haven't?
Not that I remember.

## I thought you were bringing the Colonel?
The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken.

## Need any help with those bags, Ma'am?
No thanks.

## You look mighty familiar to me. You sure you're not from around here?
I was born near here. But after my mother died, my dad moved. I grew up out in Rossmore Park.

## Save him? What are you talking about?
But the place burned to the ground.

## Boy, put that thing down. You can't take that. Might be evidence.
Illibent? Who's club is that?

## Evidence of what?
Somehow I don't think he stabbed himself in the chest, then buried himself too.

## You want to get into this now?
No, no, Caesar. Not now.

## Glenlivet, right, Gino?
I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.

## So Caesar, what did it total out at?
Two point one seventy-six.

## What's that, Johnnie?
The money I bet it was nothing to get it clean, after you made such a fucking big deal ...

## Where is this going, Johnnie?
Just admit it, Caesar.

## Admit what?
That you overreacted. That you lost it. Not me. It was your mistake.

## All right! Where's the key?
You don't need a key.

## How the fuck can I open it?
The same way you did before.

## We know how this was done, eh?
Yeah, I know.

## What the fuck is going on?
Oh, shit ...

## Not bad. What for?
That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.

## Just look at this mess I got to deal with.
Why? Cause you know him?

## What are you going to do with it?
I told them to run it through the cycles. But I guess Gino has plans for it because he's coming here tomorrow night to pick this shit up.

## Where the hell's the laundry detergent?
Ummm ... in the linen closet.

## You mean they weren't up here?
No! They're still on their way.

## Why?
Because I just saw Johnnie downstairs.

## What?
I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes.

## Caesar, what are we going to do?
Got to think this through ...

## He didn't see you, did he?
No.

## Caesar, what are you going to do?
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.

## What?
Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.

## What happened to them?
I don't know. We may never know, but I'm going to guess it was a job, maybe the Karpoli family.

## Caesar, what are we going to do?
They're just cops. Stall them as long as you can.

## Where, then?
I don't know. it could be anywhere. We don't even know if he was alone. Please, Caesar, we don't have much time. Let's get out of here.

## What are you doing?
We're going to need some time.

## Who are you going to call?
I can use Johnnie's car, dump it in Lake Michigan ... I need plastic bags ... tape and rope ...

## Let us go and we'll make a deal.
Where is the money?

## What did she do to you?
You're blowing your only chance. Act like I'm Gino.

## How's it going tonight, fellas?
Pretty good, sir.

## I'm going to make myself a drink, if that's okay?
Go right ahead, sir.

## You're helping Rajeev?
No. Rajeev's in India.

## How many'd you do?
Five.

## What? How about a drink?
My brushes, I have to clean my brushes. Thanks, though.

## Now, where the fuck is my money?
Lick me.

## Where is it?
Either pull the trigger or get that thing out of my face.

## Why?
I could be lying.

## Are you okay, Violet?
Mickey, why is Johnnie here? You know how I feel about that fucking psycho.

## Caesar, didn't I tell you to get something?
Sure, Mickey. Sure.

## Yeah?
Hey, Mickey.

## What? They ain't there?
No. I don't know where they are. I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.

## Okay. Let me call around. I'll see what I can do. Don't go anywhere, okay?
Okay, sure, Mick.

## Caesar, you still got the money?
Yeah, Mick. I've got the money. I'm staring right at it.

## Me? Why?
We went over to Johnnie's place just to check it out and it was busted up, Bad.

## Oh Christ, the phone ... That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?
Hey, if Violet was helping me relax, I'd probably do the same thing.

## Cease, can I ask you something?
Yeah.

## Why'd you move all the furniture around?
Actually, yeah, she was nervous about Gino coming, wanted everything to look right. You know women, Mick.

## Is that the money?
Yeah, that's it.

## Hey, Caesar, where's the key?
Un-fucking-believable. I called those highway patrol dumb fucks.

## Hello?
No joke, ma'am. Please open the door.

## How do I know you are cops?
Ma'am, you have to open the door.

## Who?
Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.

## So this is temporary for you?
Pretty much. One day at a time.

## A favor?
Oh, I'm sorry --

## Are they really?
Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room. But if it's too much trouble, I understand ...

## You're doing everything yourself?
Yeah.

## So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?
I don't, really. I was referred to him.

## Do you know him?
No, but Caesar does. He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.

## Caesar is your husband?
Oh no, no. I'm not the marrying kind.

## Do you have a pot or a bucket?
Sure.

## A beer?
A beer. Of course.

## You seem uncomfortable. Do I make you nervous, Corky?
No.

## Are you surprised that I know what it is?
Maybe.

## I have a tattoo, would you like to see it?
Isn't it obvious? I'm trying to seduce you.

## Why?
Because I want to. I've wanted to since I first saw you in the elevator.

## If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
No.

## You have to ask?
They took over a club I was working at. Caesar started managing it.

## He's a launderer?
Basically.

## How long have you been with him?
Almost five years.

## The redistribution of wealth?
That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed.

## What's wrong?
Nothing.

## You didn't want to see me, did you?
If there is one thing I can't stand about sleeping with women, it's all the fucking mind reading.

## What are you afraid of?
I'm not afraid of anything.

## I don't understand - ?
I know! You can't understand, because we're different, Violet. We're different.

## How can you sit in that bed and say that?
Because it's the truth.

## Let me guess. This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside. That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?
Oh no, she's nothing like you. She's a lot smarter than you.

## Is that what her daddy tells her?
I know what I am. I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.

## What are you saying? That you don't have sex with men?
I don't.

## For Christ's sake, Violet! I heard you! Thin walls, remember?
What you heard wasn't sex.

## What was it then?
Work.

## You mean Shelly?
Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.

## Even though he knew about you?
Yes.

## He was in love with you, right?
For Shelly, taking the money was a way to take from Caesar. He could have run at any time, but he didn't because he didn't want out.

## Mickey?
I want out. I want a new life. I see what I've been waiting for, but I need you, Corky.

## How much money?
Shelly said it was over two million dollars.

## You think I'm lying?
All you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected, someone like me.

## Is that what you think?
I'm just making a point. You have no idea what you're asking. How much trust two people need to do something like this.

## Do you think you know me like that?
I think ...

## You said he washed the money?
Yeah.

## What?
To let it dry.

## And where is it now?
In his office. I saw it this morning.

## Does the case lock?
Yes.

## Johnnie?
It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.

## Who is Gino?
Gino Marzzone.

## Marzzone? As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?
That's his brother.

## Gino Marzzone is coming tonight to pick up the money?
Yeah.

## And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone?
Yeah.

## What happened?
Not much, really. Caesar was nervous, kept cleaning the apartment. |The first time, he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear.

## Does Johnnie hit on you?
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.

## Has Caesar ever seen him?
He does it right in front of him.

## What did Gino drink?
Scotch, Glenlivet. I remember that Caesar made a huge deal about it.

## What time did you say they would be there?
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.

## Any bodyguards?
Gino travels with a big man named Roy. Caesar calls him the driver.

## Where will you be?
He won't.

## I'm just asking, what if?
If he does ...

## When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won't take off?
The same way I'll know that you went to Scotch. Trust.

## Why?
If it's real enough, he'll believe it, because deep down he'll want to.

## If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
I had a partner and she fucked me.

## What happened?
He totally freaked. I've never seen him like this. He's out of his fucking mind.

## What if he doesn't run?
That means he probably will kill Johnnie.

## You know what the difference is between us, Violet?
No.

## Pop?
Caesar, come here. Sit. We talk now. You too, Johnnie.

## Unbelievable. Can you believe that, Violet?
Hey, Johnnie ...

## Johnnie, what did I say?
Pop, this is important to me. It's a simple question. if he would just answer the question, that's the end of it.

## Don't worry about Caesar. I'll handle Caesar. You just get out of here, okay?
Oh, God.

## Mickey? What are you doing here?
Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie. They were in a car accident.

## Oh my God. Was anyone hurt?
I will never understand it, Mickey. You didn't even call the police.

## You're asking me a direct question?
Yes.

## And what if I couldn't do that?
She's a gypsy. If it's a cover, it's a great one.

## We're exploring every possibility. We are in pursuit. How much more do you want me to tell you?
Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is.

## What if he is working for someone else? What if he turned?
No. We can't risk it.

## I work alone. Like you... ...we always work alone.
What do you want to do?

## What do you mean?
Who are you? Rome? Paris? Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...

## Treadstone?
...which one are you?...

## What is Treadstone?
...what did you do?...you must've really fucked up...

## What do they want me to do?
...they won't let you go...

## What did you do to me?
I don't know.

## They're right about you, aren't they? You're fried. You really don't know what's going on, do you?
I know you've been trying to kill me.

## That's all I get?
We'll make you better. We can put the pieces back. We can do that.

## I think investment advice from a dead man, it's a bad idea. How does it feel to be dead?
It's a lot more stressful than I thought.

## Was this a game or a fuck up?
Yes. I mean, I think so. Yes. Yes...

## You have your passport?
I have a passport. I've got... Actually, it's a little complicated.

## Do you have your passport, sir?
Look, maybe I should just...

## Yes, sir... How can I help you?
One moment, sir.

## You are a friend of his?
Yes.

## His brother. You know his brother?
Right. Yes. Of course.

## Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
I think not... No, I'm sorry. It was very sudden. He was here very briefly.

## Did you?
Well, I mean it's a tough business, isn't it? Cutthroat.

## Excuse me?
I hadn't heard.

## Get me out of here. Please.
I need a ride out of here.

## So what's in Paris?
I want to go home.

## What if I say no?
Then I'll find another ride.

## I'm sorry. Really. What do you want me to do?
I don't know.

## What does that mean?
Listen to what you want.

## Who pays twenty thousand dollars for a ride to Paris?
I don't know. I don't know who I am.

## What? Like amnesia?
Look, go ahead...put the radio on...

## Amnesia? You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
No.

## When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
Nothing. It's just not there.

## What are you talking about?
I don't know.

## There was a gun. Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
Lots of people have guns. You're American. Americans love guns.

## Where are we?
We're about an hour away.

## You were tired. Here... For twenty-thousand I like to throw in breakfast. So what do you dream about?
I dream I'm asleep. I dream that I'm asleep and I can't wake up. I don't think I smoke.

## You ever think maybe you have a family?
I thought about it. I don't know.

## That's it? Is that it?
Four-fifty. That's the address...

## Looks familiar?
No. No. Go around. Keep going...

## Where?
Yeah. Pull in here. Park it.

## So this is it, right?
I guess.

## Nah... With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
How could I forget about you? You're the only person I know.

## This is like a real apartment. This is really yours?
I guess so.

## See. It's starting to come back, yeah? You mind if I take a bath?
...omigod, no...

## Who paid the bill?
It's a company... MPG Capital.

## What does that mean? Jason, what does that mean? Jason, please...who is he?
I don't know.

## So what are we doing?
Go back to the hotel.

## You could do that?
Yes. That's who I want to be.

## Who is it?
If you're lucky. Take it. There's enough in there to make a life. Any life. Just get out now. Get low. Stay low. Take it.

## What was I thinking, right?
I can't protect you anymore.

## What about you?
I'm gonna find the end of this. I can't protect you.

## This your store?
Yes.

## You have ID?
Not really.

## Where's the dog?
My husband's out looking for him.

## That old beast? Miss his breakfast? Not a chance. It's always something, right?
Get in the basement.

## What?
Get everyone down in the basement.

## What the hell're you talking about?
1 That's the only angle.

## What's that?
Zurich police are looking for an American with a red bag. Apparently he put two cops in the hospital last night.

## What the fuck is he doing?
Maybe it's a game. Maybe he's trying to send us a message.

## What?
Abbott. He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.

## What if it doesn't come back?
I told you. You need to rest.

## It came from your hip. Under the skin. You have a bank in Zurich. You remember Zurich?
No.

## Look, I'm just on this boat, okay? I'm an engineer. Whatever this is, it's not for me to be involved, okay?
I don't remember Zurich.

## You drink rum?
I don't know.

## ...your ducts?
I fixed it myself.

## What have you done to my flat?
You telephone, sir.

## Mumble ... Tuttle ...
What have you got there?

## Ah ha ... there you are, Sam.
Tuttle! ... mumble! You've had that scab Tuttle here, haven't you?

## What? How do you know my name?
We know everything here. This is the Storeroom of Knowledge.

## Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.

## Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
Go away.

## What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?
Layton.

## Jill Layton ... You're a very good little girl. What are you doing here?
I'm waiting for my daddy.

## In fact, killing people - they'd get a lot more out of life.
Deputy minister, what do you believe is behind this recent increase in terrorist bombings?

## Mr. HELPMANN, what would you say to those critics who maintain that the Ministry Of Information has become too large and unwieldy ...?
David ... in a free society information is the name of the game. You can't win the game if you're a man short.

## Do you think that the government is winning the battle against terrorists?
But the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year ...

## Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind. I'd like to accept the transfer - am I too late?
Too late? That's for me to say.

## Gillian Layton?
She doesn't like me telling anyone but she's pleased as anything really.

## Remember how they used to stick out?
Yes, thanks.

## What?
You clever bastard! I might have guessed. You only moved in today and you're already hot on the bloody trail.

## Am I?
Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other on this one. If you make a reputation with this case, it'll be at my expense.

## How much do you know?
Not much.

## Enough though, eh?
Not really, no.

## You got the wrong man.
B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?

## You killed him?
I'm sure you have

## What has Tuttle done?
We suspect him of freelance subversion.

## You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
Er ... no.

## A terrorist?
But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and ...

## Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it?
Look, about the Layton woman - maybe she's just trying to help the Buttle family.

## So what are you going to do about her?
Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list.

## Well, I ... Good point. What do you suggest?
Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.

## Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?
Of course. We went to school together. You're my oldest friend.

## You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?
I do. Goodbye.

## I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They told me you had a form I had to fill in.
Jack?... Jack?

## Have you got an Arrest Receipt?
Yes.

## Stamped?
No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.

## Where do I get it stamped?
Information Adjustments.

## You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you?
If you say so.

## You think these are tits don't you?
Ah.

## I bet you'd like to touch them?
It's you ... it's you ...

## Them?
Us. Them. I don't know ... just get going.

## Why are they all pigs at Information Retrieval?
I don't know. Hey, that's not a very nice thing to say.

## Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
I didn't run away. I left the flat.

## Why?
I didn't like it.

## Where are you taking me?
Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're taking me.

## What's going on here?
What does it look like ... I'm collecting empties.

## What parcel?
It's heavy.

## What are you doing in Information Retrieval?
Looking for you.

## What do you mean? Would you rather have terrorists?
Well, terrorists of course.

## How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists?
Actual. terrorists? Well ... it's only my first day.

## What?
They'll be there waiting.

## Who will?
Security.

## Are you still following me?
Please, Jill ... I love you.

## You've got to trust me. It sounds silly but I know we were meant to meet.
There are plenty of other safe places. Why don't we go back to my flat?

## You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me?
I saved you from the lorry and you're not very special.

## Jill! What are you do ... I mean ... how did you ... Are you alright?
Yes.

## Your face ... are you hurt?
No. No. I'm fine. I was worried sick about you ... I thought ...

## Are you sure?
Yes.

## Don't you like parties?
C'mon. We've got to get out of here.

## Where are you going?
I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.

## What do you think? ... is it me?
You don't exist any more. I've killed you. Jill Layton is dead.

## Perhaps the machine's on the blink! It keeps picking up old films. That can't he right, can it?
Information Retrieval.

## Would you really, Sam?
Really.

## Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
27156789/074328/K.

## What?
Drive out to Mrs Buttle, give her the cheque, tell her to sign her name on the back, cash it at the corner sweet shop.

## Here. What do I do next?
Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport.

## Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How do I authorize a cheque?
Here we are. Pink and blue receipts. All you've got to do is sign these and the back of the cheque.

## Is it all right about Mrs Buttle's cheque?
I delivered it.

## Can I forget it?
All information on 3rd Level Suspects is classified.

## It's what you wanted isn't it?
Yes ... No ... I don't, know.

## No, you can't have any more chairs! There's only one left in here now, and I need that to sit on! Oh ... er, sorry. Who are you?
Sam Lowry.

## What?
I'll bring it back in ten minutes.

## You want to take my console into your office?
What? Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.

## How long will she he away?
There are some who go to Dr. Jaffe's clinic who never come back at all.

## A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I may say so. Monsieur?
Numero une, crevettes  la mayonaaise.

## What is it?
It's something for executives.

## Don't be childish, Samuel. Of course you want something. You must have hopes, wishes, dreams.
What were we saying?

## Mother? Is that you?
Of course. Isn't it wonderful? The bandages came of this afternoon. Come and join the fun. Everybody's here.

## Is Mr Helpmann here?
Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.

## What have you done with his body?
Um ...

## Really, Sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists?
What? Now? It's my lunch hour.

## Whatever happened to you?
Actually, there's someone I want to meet ...

## I think that'll hold it. Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
Er, yes ...

## I can't make up my mind whether to have a number one or a number two. What do you recommend, Spiro?
Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.

## Thank you, Spiro. Shirley, what are you going to have?
Numero huit, braised veal in wine sauce.

## Who's that?
Put the phone down and your hands up.

## What? Who is this?
My name is Sam Lowry. I have to report to Mr Warren.

## Er, don't you want to search me?
No, sir.

## Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me through to Mr Helpmann's office?
I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.

## And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information?
I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.

## Are we?
Ah yes, the lady is waiting.

## Yes?
Central Services.

## Fixed?
I mean it fixed itself.

## Have you got one or haven't you?
Not ... as such ...

## I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a stickler for paper work. Where would we be if we didn't follow the correct procedures?
We'll be back.

## What the - ? How did you - ?
Emergency procedures.

## For God's sake, what's happened?
Thermostat's gone. And then some.

## What is it?
It's a 27B/6 of course.

## What is this? Who the hell are you?
Harry Tuttle. Heating engineer. At your service.

## They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call.
Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?

## Are you saying this is illegal?
Well, yes ... and no. Officially, only Central Service operatives are supposed to touch this stuff ... Could you hold these.

## The pace?
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount

## Are you expecting anyone?
Time to go.

## Thank you very much. How much will it...?
On the house. You did me a favor. Check the corridor.

## I'll fire you tomorrow. Hell, better than that, I'll forward you some sick time. A week, two weeks off-- how about that?
I don't think a week's gonna do it.

## What if there is no tomorrow?
Go on, get outta here, Pierce, before I give you a big hug. I love this guy.

## Can you walk? Puedes caminar?
She say she in great pain.

## Is she dying?
She's having a baby. Twins.

## You know each other a long time?
Two years. Ever since we left island.

## In that time, you ever have sex?
Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.

## No underwear?
We are virgins.

## Hey Cy, guess who's here?
Mary ...

## Frank, take it easy. what happened?
He flipped out.

## Be cool, man. You're having a paradoxical reaction. It can happen. Didn't I tell you this guy was stressed out?
Stressed? He's psycho.

## Where is she?
Sleeping in the back.

## I know, but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours. Terrible about her father, isn't it?
I better just go in and see her.

## Got a beer?
That shit is poison, Frank. We don't drink alcohol here. What you need is one of these.

## Did you give Mary something called Red Death?
I should be going. I just quit.

## Is this what you gave Mary?
That's the stuff. I call it the Red Lion. Very king-of-the-jungle.

## I can't hold up my head anymore.
Does that hurt?

## So, Frank, am I going to live?
You're going to live.

## What about Kanita?
Dead.

## Twelve Young, I don't have time for your games. Now answer me or do I have to come out there myself?
Ten-four, hon. This is for you.

## He's going to be all right, right?
No. He's dead.

## What's his name?
IB Bangin.

## What'd you mean IB Bangin? What kind of name is IB Bangin?
Excuse me. You are a very kind man. I can see that. A man like you could not refuse a poor sick dying helpless man a small cup of water.

## Oh man, do you mean that? Thank you man, thank you. How?
Well, you have your choice, pills, injection, gas.

## What did you say?
Shut up. You're going to die and he's not. Got it.

## Yeah?
What the hell. The next year, tiebreaker for the division, in Boston, Yanks down two to nothing, Bucky Dent steps to the plate.

## What?
Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked.

## Is he going to be alright?
His heart's beating.

## Is there any chance?
I guess there's always a chance.

## That boy you brought in, he was shot, wasn't he?
Yes.

## He's dead, huh?
Yes.

## Did you see my father?
No.

## Yes?
Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.

## He's better, isn't he?
Well, the doctor says he's showing some movement. It's still early, it might mean nothing, but I thought you'd want to know.

## How is she?
Sleeping.

## He's better, though, right?
He's better.

## It's best not to ... It's good pizza, huh?
Not as good as Nino's.

## Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.

## On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
We moved out after that. Upstate.

## Like everybody else--except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents ... ?
They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess.

## You married?
Ah, no. I was. It's hard to explain. She had a hard time adjusting to, well, maybe it was my fault too.

## How long you been doing this?
Five years.

## Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
You must get a lot of overdoses. I bet you picked me up a couple of times.

## Maybe not. I was a different person then. Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this?
Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.

## Can I bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza?
No, the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody.

## Who is it?
Frank.

## My Lord mother man, you look like hell. What were you drinking?
I think the worst is over.

## Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date? She hit you with a bottle?
She loves me the way no woman ever has.

## I ever tell you about the time years ago I was on this ledge uptown, trying to talk this psycho inside?
Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story.

## Who's that?
Oh, Frank, you've got it bad, so much worse than I thought.

## Rule number one, Don't get involved with patients. Rule number two, Don't get involved with patient's daughters. You understand?
What about rule number three, Don't get involved with dispatchers named Love.

## What's that, Frank?
Three legs.

## Backup?
It's coming.

## What look?
You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.

## I hate pronouncing people dead over the phone. Better, huh? They're fixed and dilated. He's plant food.
Where you going?

## He one of them?
That guy I brought in yesterday, post-cardiac arrest. He's gone.

## How many times have you shocked him tonight?
Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.

## What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
A medical miracle.

## Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp! Anybody else hurt?
No.

## Where's Burke?
Upstairs. 212. Had to shock him twice more.

## Would you like to come in?
Yes.

## Yeah. Great, isn't it?
Great to be drunk. Sobriety's killing me.

## Where you going?
C'mon, Tom. The city's burning.

## Whatja doing?
I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.

## You okay?
I never felt better in my life.

## Whadda we bring?
Better bring it all.

## How's he doing?
I haven't had a chance to see him yet. I'm going to take care of sleeping beauty.

## Who with?
That's your job. Just keep driving, keep moving. No stopping. We're sharks. We stop too long, we die.

## What do you want to break?
I don't know--let's break some windows.

## Why?
That's ridiculous.

## No shit.
You learn that in the army?

## The Chinese close in five minutes. Beef lo mein. It's been on my mind since I woke. Whatjathink?
I think the moment that food hits your mouth we'll get a job.

## What?
I'm not hungry.

## What?
You know what. The radio.

## Well why didn't you say so?
He's drunk.

## Tell me, you ever think of doing anything else?
He's crazy.

## You really think so?
You're in the stomach! Let me try.

## Okay if I watch you tape that interview downstairs?
Yeah.

## You write this?
Nice, Jane.

## Hi, Aaron...What's doing?
Same old stuff. I'm watching a man who won three Overseas Press Awards pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.

## You want to go out there -- get out of this for a second?
Why don't you lead? I'll just follow the flurry you cause.

## What did I do to you?
You've made my dreams silly.

## Great. Network news, Washington... I love it. What do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?
Keep it to yourself.

## Okay. Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...

## Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?
Okay, let's drop it. I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...

## We're conversing...Oh my, the names of the entire Cabinet has slipped my mind. What are they?
Don't name them. Just tell me if you know.

## You're feeling good, aren't you?
I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.

## Fifty, right?
I'm in a pissy mood. I'm sorry.

## What's wrong with it?
Nothing. I think you really blew the lid off nookie.

## What?
Your coat jacket is rising up in back.

## I'll put her on.
No?

## What did they do with you?
They booted me out of Washington.

## I don't think so.
Why? What did they do to you?

## Yes. You're not going to stick around for the farewell party?
No. I don't know how much fun it will be when Martin Klein and Ernie have to drop off their credentials with the security guard.

## He excels at gratitude.
Well, this kid couldn't possibly belong to anyone else. What's your name?

## Are you any closer to a decision?
It's nice to see you.

## It's Mr. Buddy Felton?
Yes.

## That's your full name?
Yes.

## I might as well ask you the questions on tape. Is that all right?
Yes.

## You're saying the fact that you're gay had something directly to do with your promotions?
I don't like the word gay.

## Which would you prefer?
Ravenous homosexual.

## Why do you say that?
Because nobody invites a bad- looking idiot to their bedroom.

## Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive? If needy were a turn-on?
Call if you get weird.

## Oh, God. Back it, Bobbie -- Bobbie?
I didn't sleep. They're giving me less and less air time. They don't think I'm at all anchor material.

## Did you shoot their boots?
Of course.

## You know you've had a strange day... I'd sleep on all these things you've been thinking.
What happened?

## Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
Yes.

## A long time. I was restless. Will you crack my neck?
Aaah -- -- ello. You sure they said the management meeting? They want me to be at the management meeting.

## Yes...I was thinking that way too... Which tie?
I read about it -- that's how you can make sure you don't put on too much perfume...

## You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
No.

## Did it really go well?
Define your terms.

## Do you feel good about it?
No.

## Do others feel that you did well?
No.

## Then what was good about it?
I lost six pounds...

## Aaron, will you tell me?
What do you mean, flop sweat? -- you're making too much out of it...I'll bet you were the only one aware of it...

## There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.

## If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
I have to be somewhere.

## Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?
I don't know. I may be in love with him.

## What?
Let me think a second. It's tough.

## How?
Because we have the kind of relationship where if I were the Devil, you'd be the only one I told.

## Hi. Will I ever sing again?
Bastard, sneak, quitter.

## Why not try it for a few weeks?
Tell me the God's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me? Because if you are...

## I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
Maybe the best part of your life is over and you don't want to get up and start the bad part.

## You are now required to sit here with me. Come on...be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us?
Yes.

## You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?
I think so...They've been talking to me about being Tom's Managing Editor.

## Really?
I'm going to take it.

## So who's the guy?
Well, we met about three months ago. He works at the surgeon general office. He loves boating. So, he's been getting me into water skiing.

## I like it! So, doll, what about you lately?
Well -- my wife got this new job...

## In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
No -- Don't worry about it. Let's do this.

## You didn't say anything to her?
That's it. I resign as of now.

## Just tell me what's really going on. I think we know each other well enough for me to expect that.
Oh, I was just writing you a note. What do you say we take a walk?

## Wipe me out?
Anyway. I want you to think of this as...

## Prepare what? You have Saturday's news handy?
It's been a while since you read the news -- I'll have somebody work with you. Just on superficial performance things.

## Just a few questions?
No.

## Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuckes. Snot... Fuckee. You want to use that?
It depends on how big a news day it is.

## All this business of war -- do you get scared?
Uh-uh. I'm a little freaked right now about seeing my father though.

## My gosh, and for a while there, I was attracted to you.
What is she shooting?

## Just when do you start, telling people?
Almost immediately.

## Jane?
Yes.

## Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?
No, I don't. He happens to deserve the credit. He's right here.

## What did he say?
I'll never tell.

## Do you know you're the second woman in network news history to produce?
No, I'm not. I'm the fourth. Joan Richmond. Pauline Fredericks got that credit once on a U.N. special and there's Susan Zirinsky.

## Do you want him all the way to the car?
No stop where he's all besieged.

## They're not really going to call security are they?
No, I don't think so.

## How do I get out of here?
Follow me.

## Yes. How do you know?
My roommate's very social -- somebody from Justice was over and...I always hear things before they happen. Hey, and from now on, so do you.

## What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
No. Really...don't worry about it.

## Is everything all right?
Yes. You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...

## Yes, stop! I wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening. What's wrong?
I broke up with my roommate -- He was really the magnet for everyone who knew anything.

## What?
They fired me.

## I don't know a recent Saturday I've sold more. You didn't think I'd sell that health restaurant, did you?
No. Not even you.

## Why so glum?
I don't know.

## I got my report card. Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete.
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?

## Oh my. I see you studying so hard, Tom. What do you think the problem is?
I'll just have to try harder. I don't know. I will. I will. I will. I will.

## That would be great. It better help. What can you do with yourself if all you do is look good?
Okay, that's your opinion. I don't agree.

## You're just absolutely right and I'm absolutely wrong?
It must be nice to always believe you know better. To think you're always the smartest person in the room.

## That actually goes on...
I like \"godsend.\"

## Yes. My room is down here -- I'm not tired. Do you want to keep talking?
Yes, sure.

## So great -- right?
Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at.

## How are you at back rubs?
I trust you.

## Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track. Did you go to college?
One year...almost one year.

## Hey?
Those audition tapes I sent out... I've been hired by your network for the Washington bureau. So I'll probably see you at work. Sorry.

## I can't help you, sorry. I'm not here to teach remedial reporting.
You weren't. Thanks. How does it feel being here?

## And it has nothing to do with the fact I left your room instead of staying there?
Hi.

## Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.

## So he was indicted?
Yes.

## Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
Billion.

## What do you mean clean?
At work there's always this sort of film over you.

## You okay?
Yes. Just don't say anything mean for a while. Thanks.

## Nervous?
I'll wait for you till seven.

## Jennifer, you want to have another drink?
Hey, I know how to have a burger by myself. I feel like a little solitude.

## Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
I'll get you through. Move and smile. And smile and move...

## Okay. You didn't like the party, huh?
Too many smart people in one room -- it's not healthy...

## Eventually. Does it have to be right now?
Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.

## What?
I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.

## If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?
Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage.

## Jane, yes. Tom? Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
Yes.

## No. Were you going to you?
Uh-huh.

## So you like me, huh?
I like you as much as I can like anyone who thinks I'm an asshole.

## So what did you think?
Yeah.

## Suppose I go in for a little while and you wait in the lobby-bar. How's that?
Good. That's it...See you.

## You're not going to take off on me, are you?
Uh-uh.

## You okay?
Great.

## Why can't I let go of this woman?
Well...

## You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
This is hysterical.

## I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight. You know why?
Because you're nuts.

## Right, right -- Isn't she fun to tease?
I don't remember saying anything like that -- exactly...I don't know why I just did.

## What?
Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.

## What happened?
Don't run off -- like everything's settled the minute you make up your mind.

## He might be weird -- he can talk more freely if I go alone -- why's that so hard to understand?
It's not that it's hard. I just want you to give me a minute to catch up.

## Where are you?
I can't get away just yet. I'm at Aaron's.

## Well, when?
I'm not sure. It seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news.

## Not if you count 'Singing in the Rain.' Do him a favor and don't treat it like a tragedy. You want me to talk to him?
Hi, again. Sorry about...

## Hello?
Yes.

## I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.

## No. Did he really?
Yes. Then he said a really weird thing...

## What?
That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... He gets like that sometimes.

## How can you say that to me?
Well, I just think that' an extraordinary proposal.

## You fucking...
That's yes?

## Why?
I saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl. I know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.

## We disagree on how God-awful it was. Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?
Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it. I was up all night and...

## It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?
It just proves that the difference we have are...

## You want to come?
It's just that one of the few things I'm not confused about is what I was saying downstairs, that...

## A picnic?
I thought for ol' Cliff here -- Look at you? You're more adorable than your pictures. Look what I got for you.

## How come you're not chasing it down yourself?
Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.

## This is my first time at the White House. Is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it?
I didn't have the guts to ask when I first came up. I'll get you a great tour.

## Where's the bathroom?
Through the closet.

## Are you okay?
Yes, I'm sorry.

## Don't be silly. What are you sorry about?
The way you were looking at me, I just went.

## Would you like to do me?
I wanted to apologize for being nasty to you this evening.

## Yes. Fifty dollars an hour, right?
Yeah.

## What, right now?
Uh-huh.

## Are you nervous, Walter?
N-no...

## Not even a little bit?
I already told you I'm not.

## Are you a virgin?
It's just an innocent question. Besides I just wanted to clarify your intentions.

## Whaddya mean?
Well I just wanted to make sure you know, fully and completely, that you're never gonna get any from me, at least in this lifetime.

## Anything new?
Not really. One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.

## Is the manager cooperating?
Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight.

## What the hell's going on?
Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.

## What did he do?
He made a cat.

## Don't worry about him...what have you got?
Of course...it's wonderful.

## What's it called?
Murdered man.

## How did you ever find it all in yourself, Walter?
It wasn't easy.

## What's up, Walter?
I came over to see you. I brought something...I wanted to show you.

## You think she's better than Murdered Man?
Well I can't say that Walter! She's incomparable. They're both great.

## More champagne, your majesty?
Here here...

## Sorry...
May I please have another little kiss?

## Did you hear what he said?
Yes Walter.

## It's true, isn't it?
Every word...

## Are you ready?
Ready? We've got plenty of time.

## Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
Oh, I don't know. Smart people. Creative people I guess.

## Uh... ...how long have you been thinking about this, Walter?
Oh...f-for a long time. Ever since you first came to the club.

## I've been thinking... Carla, would you do one favor for me?
Just about anything, Walter.

## Would you let me make...a statue of you?
Would you really like to? That would make me very happy.

## Ok...tonight. I'll make a statue of you tonight, OK?
Walter...there's...

## When did you make this, Walter?
Walter...I can't believe it.

## I'm trying to find a style of my own. Do you really like them?
Oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...

## What are you doing here so early?
Maybe so...

## When do we get to see it? WALTER Well...any time, I guess.
Leonard, what are you doing?

## Are you alright?
Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine.

## What's the matter with you?
Nothing...nothing at all.

## I've never seen anyone so... squeamish. Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
Don't ask.

## What's wrong with you, why do you want to hide it?
You're right. We should build a collection first.

## Would you pose for me for free?
Well, it all depends, Leonard...

## I know, man.
Yeah, can you say plagiarism?

## I mean, screw them, you know? I'm just gonna go right on creating 'cause it comes from here - you know?
I know, man.

## Now what kind of statue was that?
No man I'm on my own plane.

## Man, why do you suppose Walter wants to get her alone? You suppose he could be physically attracted to her?
I was just looking at Carla's picture.

## Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
Well I was uh, just looking...

## Where'd ya buy that?
I didn't buy it I made it.

## Dead Cat?
Yeah.

## You want to buy it, put it in the club?
You want me to buy Dead Cat? It'll scare people away.

## Well...why did you put a knife in it?
I didn't mean to.

## Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll put it in the corner of the alcove. If it sells, we'll split it fifty- fifty. How's that?
Sure! So I guess that means I'm an artist after all.

## A parakeet?
Go home.

## Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
H-have a seat?

## They are?
Hiya Carla.

## Well...why murdered man?
I don't know, it just happened, I guess. I didn't mean to.

## You didn't mean to what?
Well, I mean it could have been something else, but it just worked out that way.

## A show?! Like this Sunday?
N-no! Not exactly, I mean you take years and years...

## A show..how soon can we go?
These things take time Walter... but for now you've got to break out of this one...avenue you're on...

## Yeah, why?
You might talk too much.

## Hello Leonard! Beautiful morning, isn't it?
It was.

## Whatsamatter Leonard?
Never mind...

## Yeah?
Well invite the critics, and the art collectors...we'll tell them...

## What do you want for it? Two thousand? Three thousand?
Uh, hi.

## Yes, you have. Can I come in?
Uh, sure.

## Did you see my cat?
Yeah I did.

## You are?
I got you cold, pal. Make it easy for yourself, use your head.

## Are you done with these?
Yes, get rid of them...

## Did you like it Mister Brock?
Call me...Maxwell.

## And what project looms on the horizon, Walter?
No thanks. Sounds good though.

## I get it Walter. I get it.
Why not?

## What do you get?
Your work, the layers of irony.

## With Dead Cat?
With Dead Cat. Like a breath of fresh air. I could just - babble on about it for hours.

## Really?
It's like...you've turned on.

## T-turned on?
A hot light bulb is burning inside of you. I want to be warmed by it.

## Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
If you see him.

## Straightening up indeed! Are you sure you're not alone?
I'm always alone, Mrs. Swicker, you know that.

## Walter have you been talking to yourself again?
Well yes I guess I have been Mrs. Swicker. Somebody's got to.

## The other two -- the new ones. Where are they?
I don't know. But the boy, he couldn't kill them.

## Coach knows what abs are?
Whoa! Whoa! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't actually need any right now.

## What's with you?
Nice to feel needed.

## He's got a... What do you call it? A Napoleonic Code.
Jeffrey, I don't mean to sound sexist or anything, but can I borrow her?

## Don't grab me, okay?
Absolutely. I see now the error of my mistake.

## Buffy, this is crazy. What do these guys want?
Andy, start breaking up some chairs. You'll need weapons.

## Would you sleep with them?
Yes. Definitely. Definitely. Please, God.

## Well, there it is, isn't it? You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them. What's that all about?
I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you.

## You think? Split?
Utterly. Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know. Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches.

## Wait a minute. What's wrong with you, man?
I'm fine.

## You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?
Yes.

## Wheels?
My bike! She's a lesbian, too. She told me.

## Which way did she go?
Down there.

## What's playing there?
Your parents are always going away for the weekend. You're so lucky.

## Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?
Guys. The environment. I'm telling you, it's totally key. The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it.

## Don't tread on the earth?
Dying.

## Yeah?
Have you gained a few pounds? Maybe it's that outfit...

## What's Bobby gonna say?
I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.

## You okay?
I... yeah, I'm okay. I'm fine.

## What show is this?
It's the news, Buffy.

## What'd you dream about?
Nothing.

## Come on, what was it?
Nothing. It was just a dream.

## Jealous?
Hey, baby, how ya doing? You look beat.

## So that's your tutor, huh? What is he, like, your boyfriend now?
Jeffrey. Projectile vomit.

## Buffy, what are you doing here?
I thought we were meeting here.

## You broke up with my machine?
You weren't home. Like always.

## You left me a message?
I'm out of here. Jenny.

## What?
You're even weaker than the others.

## This? This is you only weapon? Your puny faith?
No...

## Will you guys shut up, please?
It could happen.

## Can we have a hot dog, please, medium rare, and a cup of joe?
You guys are thrashed.

## Yeah, we're drunk. We're the Drunks. What's your name?
Buffy.

## How are you doing?
Oh, I'm good. I'm good. Kind of miss my knees, though.

## You want some water or something?
Water. Okay.

## Do you do this kind of thing a lot? I mean, is this like a hobby?
Not exactly.

## They were vampires, weren't they?
Yeah.

## You had a car full of stuff. Were you leaving?
Yeah, I was bailing. I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess. Bad scene.

## Where are you gonna go?
Well, I've always wanted to see Oxnard.

## Hey, jeez are you okay? You need a hand?
It's nothing. It doesn't hurt.

## You sure?
Oh, I'll be fine. Got my chair, got my window, I'm great.

## Yeah?
You know, you saved my life. And I just wanted to say... I forgive you for talking during the movie. Almost.

## Why'd you come back?
I don't know. I kind of thought I ought to be here. You know, this isn't exactly the kind of thing you can run away from.

## Buffy? What's wrong?
Oh, God. It's him. I think it's him.

## Who?
Merrick...

## I been working on some stuff for you. What'cha doing?
I'm going shopping. Don't try to stop me.

## Cool. I could actually use a couple of Allen wrenches. What do you need?
A dress.

## Dress, huh? What for?
For the dance.

## Come again?
I'm going to the senior dance.

## I don't believe this. The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?
It's not a mixer. It's the senior dance. And it's important. You wouldn't understand.

## Will I get the shit kicked out of me if I ask you to dance?
I don't actually think Jeffrey's gonna notice.

## Bugs.
Are you okay?

## Okay, guys, how about the ozone layer?
Can't. History report. The Normans and the Saxons.

## Like what?
Like my homework.

## ) What do you think?
Please. It's so '91.

## Well, where?
Beverly Center.

## Totally stale. And the ushers are like, the acne patrol. We're thinking Pavilion. Sitch?
Cafe Blase.

## Listen to you. What language are you speaking?
Get out of my facial.

## What? Oh. I used to do gymnastics. Are you looking for someone?
I'm looking for you, actually.

## What are you talking about?
I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.

## Why?
To bring you... your birthright.

## My birthright? You mean, like a trust fund?
I had a trust fund my great- grandfather, or maybe it was an inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and I spent it on shoes.

## Chosen to go to the graveyard? Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
You must believe me. You must come with me while there's still time.

## Time to do what?
To stop the killing. To stop the vampires.

## Does Elvis talk to you? Tell you to do things? Do you see spots?
I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof. You bear the mark.

## Did you ever dream that you were someone else?
Everybody does.

## How do you know all this?
I have to show you.

## Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams?
Oh, yeah, tell everyone I'm crazy. Beauty ida.

## Cramps?
None of your business. God.

## All right. What do we do now?
We wait for Robert to wake up.

## Skip it.
Where's the other one?

## They can't come in, right? Unless you invite them. Is that true?
It's true.

## What, um... What do we do?
There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start There's so little time.

## A Vampire-King? You mean like Dracula?
Oh, yes. And the man from your dreams. Lothos.

## What?
We'll cover it later.

## Great. First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate. Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out. For your parents.

## But you enjoyed it, yes?
Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.

## Cheerleading. For... sporting events, yes?
Sporting events, yeah.

## Here?
Yes, yes. It would be interesting. A nice cheer.

## It was necessary.
Who we gonna beat?

## Put your head back.
Last night. You knew I was sitting on a fresh grave, didn't you?

## Two days ago, would you have even hit me? Let alone so powerfully?
No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.

## What about bats? Do they turn into bats?
No. No bats, no flying. They... float, occasionally. Not really flying.

## Good Lord. What do you study in history?
My nails.

## They were vampires?
Same one.

## Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
You felt a little sick, didn't you? The cramps.

## A what?
A wet! Didn't I just kill that vampire? I think I did. I didn't see you killing any vampires. You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.

## Aren't I, like the chosen one? The one and only? The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me? Like, ever?
I...

## Five?
Five.

## So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
Not if you're careful.

## How can you keep doing this?
It's what I was raised to do. There aren't many of us left, the Watchers.

## Watchers?
I wish you would.

## And it makes it worse when I die, right?
Well, you know, I'm not gonna kick so easy. I've got a few things the other girls didn't have.

## As for example, what?
Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.

## But it's in the back. Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.

## Why because it's not my fate? It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it. Your fate.

## They don't even have Dolby.
And where are they now?

## So, is Jeffrey really spending the night at your house?
That's the plan.

## You and Cassandra get anything done last night?
Buffy, Jesus! You know these steps.

## You're having a fling with him?
Well, I guess you got what you came for.

## What's happening? What do you want?
So very much.

## What... are you?
No, wait. I can be dumb. Really. Or mean, or whatever. I can learn. I'm useful.

## Really?
Swear to God.

## Why? Why me?
She has died. You are the next to be called. Why do you think you were sent to me? Trained as you were? You bear the mark.

## Bessel! What are you doing here?
Hi, Grueller.

## What are you grinning at? You think I was scared?
Could be.

## You think so?
Could be.

## Listen, you little worm. I could beat your head to a pulp for you, just like I did last year, you got that? You got that?
Got that.

## I can't believe they still ate it.
Okay, what else?

## Where'd you learn how to do that?
Well, I hope so.

## I got all the plastic stuff. What should I do with it?
Throw it out.

## Omniplex?
Nee sitch. No way.

## What happened?
You're kidding.

## Does Jeffrey know?
Oh, God.

## The homelesses?
Oh, please.

## Can't they make exceptions? Maryanne Heinel? She's such a scud. Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
Well, look who's here.

## Seriously, Buffy. That look was way twisted. What were you thinking about?
I really was way way too too.

## Oh, please! When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
I'm, like, yelling at her, 'What are you doing?' And she's going 'Jeffrey, Jeffrey!' Way mental.

## What are you talking about?
Except for Prom.

## What nasty bug crawled up your bungus and where the hell are you going?
I'm leaving, man. I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.

## No... You want me to give him a message?
You should think about leaving, too, man. Sell this place... Something's going on here. I don't know. Something real weird.

## Hey. What should I do if I see Benny?
Run.

## Would you rather me be making love to him, using your name, or making love to you, using his name?
Yeah maybe you're right.

## You see how nice things are when we go slow?
You can learn to like it.

## What?
Sorry. You look great. I'm totally exhausted.

## Catch?
This in ridiculous. I'm a pro.

## Which nostril am I breathing through?
The right nostril. Good.

## My right nostril?
The ida originates at the right testicle and terminates at the left nostril.

## Switch nostrils?
Right. Okay, fire a couple in there.

## How was that?
Much better. Your delivery was fully integrated because you weren't thinking about it 'cause you were pissed off at me. This is progress.

## Yes. And so is birth. Now look me in the eyes, Nuke-- You haven't been wearing my panties, have you?
I'm yours.

## Now don't go overboard, I look incredibly hot, right?
No, no, it was great.

## How 'bout a back rub?
No, that's okay. All I need's a little nap.

## Fundamentals?
I think you're real cute.

## What'd he say?
He said if I gave in to you I'd start losing again.

## He did?
I'll be back when we lose.

## Oh--won't YOU come in?
Well I guess this is it.

## You should be at the game.
That's better. Got the radar ready?

## Five hours. We both just know. Do you think I deserve to wear white?
We all deserve to wear white.

## Annie Savoy. Wanta dance?
I don't dance.

## What do you believe in?
Oh my... Don't leave...

## See my hips?
Yep.

## So...Wanta make love?
I'm committed to Nuke for the season. You had your chance the other night.

## Well, Annie, your place or mine?
You got me all confused.

## Who are you? Do you have a job?
I teach part time at the Junior College. What if I told you I was through with Nuke? He learned his lessons quickly and left me.

## And now you wanta teach me?
I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.

## I don't know if I'd go that far.
What's so great about baseball?

## It's true, It's true! Least it used to be true. It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash?
It's possible.

## Are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're 60?
Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to. Lately I'm not so sure.

## I heard already.
Why not?

## What happened?
I quit. Hit my dinger and hung 'em up.

## Yeah...you a witch?
Not yet. It takes years of practice...

## You think I could make it to the Show as a manager?
I can do that, too.

## Number twenty-two's thighs are just great. Who's he?
Jose Galindo. He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.

## What's it say?
It says he's not bending his back on his follow-through.

## Uh oh... Can I offer you some coffee?
He's a good student.

## You need a nickname.
Praise the Lord, eh?

## Which one of us?
Oh both of you, of course...

## Is somebody gonna go to bed with somebody or what?
You're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey--slow down.

## Jesus, what kinda broad are you?
When you know how to make love, you'll know how to pitch. Shh. I love this part.

## Who's he play for?
Chicken bone cross take the curse off this bat and bring me hits.

## You a God damn witch?
Yes. A switch hitting witch. Very common in Puerto Rico.

## Will that work for me?
Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like that? Hey kids, this is the great Ebby Calvin \"Nuke\" LaLoosh.

## Why you shaking me off?
I wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority.

## Guy hit the shit outta that one, eh?
Well, I held it like an egg.

## An' he scrambled the son of a bitch. Having fun yet?
I'm having a blast. God, that sucker teed off on it just like he knew I was gonna throw a fastball.

## How?
I told him.

## How come you don't like me?
Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem. You got a gift.

## What do I got?
A gift. When you were a baby the gods reached down and turned your left arm into a thunderbolt.

## You been in the Majors?
Yep.

## \"Naw\"? There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?
By the dozen. Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies-- I'm through with one night stands.

## You're through with one night stands?! What do you want?
I just wanta play everyday despite small nagging injuries--and go home to a woman who appreciates how full of crap I truly am.

## If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
I won't have to.

## What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him.

## I was great, eh?
Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging--in the Show they woulda ripped you.

## You're the boss.
Can't you let me enjoy the moment?

## You told him I was throwing a deuce, right?
Yep. He really crushed that dinger, didn't he. Musta gone 450 feet...damn...

## What do I gotta do?
You outta your mind? If you give in now you might start losing. Never fuck with a winning streak.

## What's wrong?
My right.

## What?
Sorry about last night.

## I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon. D'you understand that?
No.

## We want you to room with him on the road and stay on his case all year. He can go all the way.
I'm too old for this shit. Why the hell am I back in \"A\" ball?

## And where can I go?
You can keep going to the ballpark and keep gettin' paid to do it. Beats hell outta working at Sears.

## Yeah, Skip, you wanted to see me?
Shut up--I like this song... April in Paris, this is a feeling, No one can ever reprieve...

## Who you calling a \"boy\"?
No.

## Can I give you my testimony?
You can do anything you want. Hop in.

## Ain't he warning up?
No. The guy's professional debut and he forgets about it.

## Better find our bonus baby, eh?
Little high.

## Even if it's the Carolina League-- this is a chance to play everyday.
Ohyeah. I shoulda throwed a slider. Damn, Crash, how're ya?

## Eight and sixteen?! How'd we ever win eight? Jose, what's this sign?
Eight and twenty-four.

## Eight and twenty-four! How'd we ever win 8 games?
It's a miracle.

## Jesus--what's got into Nuke?
I heard he's wearing women's underwear--and he's breathing through his pingala nostril.

## Nuke's overthrowing tonight, he don't look loose. Anything bothering him?
He said his chakras were jammed and he was breathing out of the wrong nostril.

## What the hell's going on out there?
Jim looking for somebody.

## Who ain't?
Well, I'd rather not say.

## He goes to a whorehouse every night?
Don't tell him I told you--he'd break my neck.

## What are you talking about?
It's like everything else in this place. You don't do it yourself, it never gets done.

## Why are you doing this to me?
I'm a little in shock, quite frankly...

## Was I at that dinner?
You were wandering around.

## Was I at that dinner?
You were wandering around.

## Was I at that dinner?
You were in the m- You were in the building.

## But what happens when they do find out?
They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.

## ...been right, but who knows?
Jesus Christ! What gun? He's got a fuckin' hero sandwich here.

## Fine, fine. How's your family?
Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my wife's pregnant again.

## M- Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein?
Hey, little Dale Evans.

## So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell you - can I call you back in a few minutes?
702 472 1862.

## You got it. Schmuck. All right. I just bought us a few minutes. Want to get back at this prick?
Now this is just a signature card.

## So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box? No one else, including myself?
That's right.

## Yeah, sure I do. Why?
Mommy.

## When did this happen, honey?
I don't know.

## You don't know? What time did your mother do this? When did she leave?
I don't know.

## Where the hell did you learn how to deal?
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.

## How did Nicky collect?
It was eight. Ace... tell him the line on the Bear's game.

## Somethin', huh?
Yeah.

## Holy shit, what've you been doin' out here?
Honey, come here.

## What do you think about me movin' out here? What's the matter? You got a problem with that?
No, of course not.

## You mean, I have your permission?
Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.

## So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya.

## No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did?
No.

## What?
Then he called me a faggot.

## All right, Ace?
Okay.

## You're still eight pounds over. What's the reason for this?
Between...

## Why, somebody's complaining?
That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone.

## What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.

## Motherfucker. Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this?
Nope, there's no way.

## Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?
Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is.

## Here, let's put a little of this on for you. I know you like this. A little butter, right, not a lot?
Hello.

## You think he got the point?
What're you doin'? He's a square guy, for chrissakes. You can't treat him like that. He's gonna run to the FBI.

## ...okay? I just wanna run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it.
No, I don't wanna come -

## You mean, quiet like this, 'I'm the boss.' That's quiet?
That's all taken out of context. Okay.

## Yeah?
Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.

## What happened to me? What happened to you?
Yeah.

## I lost control?
Yes, you lost your control.

## My wife?
Yeah.

## Now, what does she have to do with all this?
Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident.

## All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.

## And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out?
Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that.

## It's none of my business?
That's right, yeah.

## Practice enough this week, you prick?
And at the...

## What - what, Caesar's?
No, a...

## Why?
Don't ask questions. Just be there.

## What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
I don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nick.

## Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
Back -

## And what'd she want?
She was afraid to call you.

## Yeah, uh, who's this?
It's me.

## Yeah, what are you doin'? You okay?
No, I'm not okay.

## How'd you know I was here?
Well...

## She's there with you? She's there with you?
Yeah, she's here.

## Ace don't... listen, don't... don't make a scene, all right?
I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.

## How do you do?
Hey, it is my pleasure.

## Well, could there be any position... further down the trough?
I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's too incompetent. And the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted.

## Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan? Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi... How the hell'd you do it?
Well, that's why they paid so well.

## Okay. You come by the house?
I'll come by.

## Seven o'clock?
Seven o'clock.

## Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, please?
They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.

## Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
Yeah, refill'd be great.

## Well, sir, I was just...
What can I do?

## Why is she eight pounds over?
...trying to offer you the respect that your...

## We can't get rid of him?
He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.

## Why not make them happy?
We have some nice penthouses you'll enjoy. Maybe the Presidential Suite.

## What is it?
The little guy. He's half in the bag, and nobody told him he was eighty- sixed from the joint, so we...

## Who's this?
Yeah, Bill, listen, I'll explain to you later. Just - You - You got a gun at home? Yeah. Bring it over here right away.

## Right away. Okay?
I-I'll do it.

## Any change?
I hit a few... uh, games on the way back.

## What, are you trying to handicap me?
You got the wrong girl, Sam.

## You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? Cause I don't.

## You all right?
Yeah.

## Why're you crying?
I'm not crying.

## It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right?
Yeah.

## Right?
Uh-huh.

## You sure?
Yeah. Yeah.

## You're kidding? My God. What is it?
It's chinchilla.

## It's nice isn't it?
Oh...

## You do whatever you want. Do I keep my promises, or do I keep my promises?
You're so wonderful. The jewelry's not so bad, either.

## Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?
Now look, pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important.

## Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?
Hi. Nice to see you.

## What do you need?
You get her? Okay. Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.

## Twenty-five thousand? For yourself?
Yeah.

## Why do you need that much?
Well, what's the difference? I just need it.

## Okay? And you're embarrassing me. Why do want to make me feel so bad?
You can trust me.

## Yeah, how do I know?
You can't make me stop caring...

## Yeah, they're gonna kidnap my kid. What do you want?
Hello.

## Hi, it's me. Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
Listen...

## What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me?
Uh, I don't know. I gotta tell you, I don't know.

## What about the money? Uh, where's the box?
I gotta tell ya...

## ...under?
Pretty serious.

## How serious?
It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.

## ...twenty-five thousand?
Yeah.

## ...the rest of the two million is still there?
Yeah, yeah, I got the rest.

## Okay?
All right...

## With what?
With the money.

## Would you knock it off, Sam?
I'm just tryin' to figure it out.

## You threw it away?
I put her to bed.

## So, who'd you go to lunch with?
With Jennifer.

## And where'd you go?
To the Riviera.

## What'd you have?
I had a... salad.

## What did Jennifer have?
She had the same.

## Why do you want to do that?
You know why I want to do it. Just do it.

## Who were you with?
I was with somebody.

## What if he won't stop?
I mean, it could get us both killed.

## ...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
It's just for a little while, Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there.

## You understand? What? Let you go?
I just want the key to my jewelry, and I want you to let me go.

## You want your jewelry?
I want you to let me go.

## So what? So who fuckin' blew you in the parking lot before you came in... huh?
You make me sick, you fuck. Once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.

## What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for?
In a Wild and unprecedented outburst that followed his gaming license denial, Rothstein followed several...

## How many kids do you have?
Uh, I'm very proud to say that we have eight children.

## Four reels, sevens across, three fifteen-thousand-dollar jackpots? Do you have any idea what the odds are?
Shoot, it's gotta be in the millions, maybe more.

## Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?
Well, it happened so quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance to call you.

## You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was goin' on?
Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam.

## I really think you're overreacting in this whole -
I really think you're -

## That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.
You're firin' me?

## I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
Well, that's all I ask, gentlemen, a fair hearing.

## Green?
We had to make an example of these pricks that the party was over.

## I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands?
No.

## Can't do it with both hands?
No, Sir.

## Can you do it with your left hand?
Well, I... I never tried.

## So, you're a righty?
Excuse me.

## Yeah, that's my pen. Why?
I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost.

## Well, thank you. Why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off?
I just wanna get out of here.

## And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?
I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.

## Yeah?
Yeah.

## I don't want to go to Europe. I want to go to see The Elephant Man.
No, no? You didn't?

## We're not gonna go see any fuckin' elephants, okay?
I don't want to go to Europe.

## Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on?
You gotta go back out there.

## Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?
Yeah, that works out.

## But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right?
You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.

## I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?
Yes.

## No, I don't want one. Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?
Hi. Good.

## What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
You can't talk to me like...

## Sam?
Never mind fuckin' Sam. This is personal. I'll be there in the morning. You can fuckin' try me, fatso.

## Um, I'm gonna need a bag. If you could just ask the guy for a big bag, okay?
Go get a bag, man.

## 1 Now move along.
1 Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside?

## ...in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.
You fuckin' faggot! Do you know who you're fuckin' with?

## Is that the last one?
I had my kid brother, Dominick, run it for me.

## He's not here?
Carmine's gone.

## Hey, Nicky, how are you? What are you doin' here?
I'm over here now.

## Carmine left?
Uh-huh.

## Well, listen, uh... Good luck with the joint, huh?
Oh, thanks, Eddy.

## How are you?
Fine, fine.

## ...I want all the names of all the other people he had with him. And I don't care what you have to do to him to get 'em. You understand?
Yeah, I heard, yeah.

## What're you gonna do?
And I mean... that's no good.

## I'm positive. Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.

## You see... I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends. You understand?
I understand.

## You got a round figure on it?
Definitely the most important guy in this room.

## T'aggia parla.  Nicky... See that guy?
Mm.

## Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains. Okay?
All right.

## Want me to take this for you?
Uh-huh. Good.

## And how are things going down there?
Hi, Jennifer.

## Hi, how are you?
Okay, Sammy.

## Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?
Sure.

## Am I right?
I can see that. Sure.

## Mm, you want to steal it?
No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.

## Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?
I know what you mean.

## He gives a fuck what I do?
Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.

## All right?
Yeah. Thanks.

## You just relax. Nobody's killin' anybody, do you hear?
No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me.

## So, I'm gonna call you back in an hour... at this number, and you're gonna be there, right?
Nothin'.

## Yeah?
Yeah.

## You know?
Yeah. 'Cause, you know, He's never gonna give me my jewelry.

## Yeah. Boy, he really fucked himself up out here - - didn't he?
Sure did.

## Is that what you want?
Yeah.

## Yes, I will. It's what you want, isn't it? Huh?
Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

## Me? I said... nothin'. I said, I said, 'No, no, no.' Everything he said, I just kept sayin' no.
It's what you want?

## Oh, well, then, have him killed and get it over with.
If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him?

## Okay, yeah.
What about my money?

## So, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway?
I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.

## You know, I've got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go?
Well, you know...

## What's the matter?
Yes.

## Get lost?
Yes.

## All right.
Well, how 'bout that?

## Okay?
Yeah.

## Where are you goin'? Where are you? You're in that place. Where are you?
I'm here.

## No, you're not. Where are you? Where are you?
I'm always here for you.

## Bub-ut, baby, do you know that I love you too?
No, Lester.

## Do you know that?
Yeah. This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.

## Promise?
God... I wish you...

## You do?
with stupid braces on your teeth.

## What does that mean? No, I know that look. What does that mean?
It means I got the money.

## ...they're in Penthouse K.
Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now?

## They check in alone?
They checked in alone.

## Are they out now?
Yes, don't worry.

## Hey. Hey, Sammy, how are you?
Wow.

## Boy, look at this place, huh?
Incredible.

## How many of these you gonna eat, huh?
Two.

## Two?
Mm-hm.

## You know why, right?
Yeah.

## Why?
Cause it clogs up your heart.

## Well, how come I laid nine?
Cause you're a jag-off. I would have fuckin' made you lay ten...

## You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
Of course.

## What's takin' so long over there?
This peter's a motherfucker.

## What, are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you gonna buy some diamonds?
I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where I kept the choice stuff.

## She asleep?
Every night, on the couch.

## Give all the guys in your crew a piece of that?
I took care of everybody.

## You walk past me?
Hey. This is Shelly.

## Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?
They're havin' a good time too.

## Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.

## Yeah, what'd you tell him?
I told him I didn't know nothin'. But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.

## You think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back?
Nah. You would've heard somethin'.

## Yeah, what's to stop him?
I know. I know.

## I don't trust him anymore. But they'd never okay anything, you know?
Yeah, but they keep askin' about it.

## Who's this guy? Who's this guy?
Oh, he ain't nobody.

## Did I say to do anything yet? I said I'm not sure... I'll let you know. I want to think about it. Where're these pricks at?
Don't know.

## Dominick said they're in the motel?
Yeah, either that or in the fuckin' bank. I don't know. They're all over the joint.

## Take it easy. What could you do? I mean, she threw herself at you, right?
Charlie M.

## All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?
What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.

## You sure?
I'm positive.

## You're a little confused?
Yeah.

## What's the matter with you?
Receipts and bills and... everything's here.

## Since when do you talk like that?
I'm sorry.

## You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me?
I know it, I know it.

## Why don't I take him over to the office and verify it, huh?
Hi.

## Having a good time?
Yes, uh...

## Uh, I have a plane to catch to Cleveland... Can I get my winnings?
Hey, Hot Stuff. You're still on the clock...

## I still have to call my agent--my techno-single just made the hot 100...what's with the phone?
You have to dial nine first.

## Have we reached the epi-center?
That's a good one, dude. He says we're going to kill you whether you tell us where the disc is or not.

## In women?
No, in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story..

## I'm not afraid. Are you?
You designed Gotham Plaza? The big silver guys pulling on those big silver things...

## What did you think?
Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...

## Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?
So, did you see \"Seinfeld\" last week? That Kramer-guy really makes me laugh.

## Are you sure?
I'm sure.

## Oh now, you put up a good fight. Let's change the subject. Where do people who live in Oasisburg go to get away from it all?
This ring belonged to my sister. I'd love for you to...

## Oh, how long have you had your own route?
Can I just say what a classy touch the neon urinals are, Mr. Architect? I just love risking electrocution every time I..

## Women, huh?
They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle...

## She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
I suppose she does.

## Yes, did you call us here for any particular reason?
You're kidding.

## Did you ever think that maybe neither of us is Captain God?
I can. That's not an admission of guilt, It's just..I knew you had it in you...

## What little boy doesn't?
Winning.

## What do you want from me?
At this point, a nap. Oh by the way, I killed your butler and your dog..

## Even the skylight?
The \"skylight?\" Fool! It's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight...

## He didn't remember to roll up his window...
I hate innocent bystanders. Whine, whine, whine. Will he settle?

## What's the catch?
Ooh, I've read about this philly. She's the one who gave that wimp Batman all those migraines up in Gotham...

## What did you say?
Sorry man, I didn't mean that personally...

## Car wash, Captain?
Absolutely.

## Well, you don't see that everyday. Somebody tell me what's the deal with Frida Kahlo here?
Just a homeless woman. Wrong place.

## And...your point?
Hasn't anyone ever taught you that fighting violence with violence solves nothing.

## Oh please, sir, one more. Are you the reporter or the architect?
Yes. I am the reporter or the architect. You've been through so much..It looks like you've used up all nine of your lives...

## You think so?...Selina?
You've seen me...

## Men, huh?
For when the time comes..

## What's the good news?
Kelly, get to work on those new uniforms. I'm not running a summer camp here..

## How much?
Enough.

## Yes, you shouted the words \"Captain God\" at me for no reason...
I thought you'd like a ride to work. You don't own a cat, do you?

## Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
Actually, yes.

## Nothing. How's your hand?
Like you don't know...

## I'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning--What did you say?
I said I saw you last night. What were you doing hiding in that alley, running off when the superhero alarm sounded...

## Hey, architect--she's joking. Right, Selina? Selina?
I'm not through. This will come as a shock. Again, to one of you. I am Catwoman. The Catwoman.

## We have to do something. What can we do to help, Selina?
I'll let you know.

## What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?
Okay, deal.

## Is every single thing out of your mouth since your \"accident\" have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm?
Maybe.

## What's a powerful man like you standing all alone for? Dance with me?
I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance...

## What's it like being a superhero? It must be frightfully exciting..How did you guys all get together?
You seem sad, Spooky.

## You going to talk all day?
Nice breasts.

## Where do you think you're going?
Any place.

## I know. But it's an emergency. Somebody dying. Okay?
I don't see anybody in there but you.

## Do I hear a woman's voice?
I'm sorry for whatever's happened to you but we're definitely not the right people to do you any good.

## Don't you have children?
Matter of fact I did have a kid once. But he's a lot better off with his father in Milwaukee.

## What are you doing on Theo's line?
Taking messages.

## Have you got to tell her your life story?
This is my conversation. I'll say what I fucking please.

## What if they do question the authenticity?
Oh. Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.

## Who's on the phone?
I'll explain later. I'm sort of on hold.

## What was that for?
You could've made me lose my call.

## So what? What could be important enough to put your hands on me?
I didn't hurt you.

## How was I in the wrong?
I know where it is. Give me that phone back.

## This Mercedes of yours, what's it look like?
He's right, Theo. She might not be around to back up your story. You could end up in the middle of this.

## Then whose is it?
You gotta just look the other way.

## Are you guys all right?
You could've killed us.

## Why would I do that?
Let's have your license, mister.

## What's this?
See for yourself, federal agent, U.S. Treasury. On the job.

## How do we get back to the freeway?
Which is why we had a lot more to worry about than the law. These are people who don't worry about reading you your rights.

## You switched license plates?
It's taken care of.

## What do you mean tip the cops? Is the man a lunatic or what?
Will you relax? This in no way affects our business. Go on.

## Satisfied, Wiseass?
In any event, whatever occurs you do not belt anybody.

## What do you keep making me out to be?
Okay, okay, Lenore, calm down. Either let me call the school or better yet, the F.B.I.

## What am I supposed to do?
Lose the hardware now.

## I'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic. Are you there yet?
Any minute.

## Do I know you?
I can't talk any louder. They might hear.

## What'd you do! Just pick my number out of the air?
They smashed the phone. I've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.

## Who smashed the phone?
They're holding my husband downstairs.

## They gave me pills to make me sleep. They didn't realize how much Seconal I'm used to -- that I'd have so much tolerance --
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry to do this to you.

## Oh won't I?
They tortured my husband. Made him give them the pin numbers of our accounts. Once they get what's in the safe deposit box they'll kill us.

## Where'd they take you to?
I have no idea. They put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows. The shutters up here are nailed shut.

## Well isn't there a number on the goddam phone?
No -- nothing.

## I can't stay on this line. I'm picking people up. I'm already overdue. Hello?
I'm fine. She's back on. Hello? I'm here.

## What do they need her for?
26th off Wilshire.

## Why isn't anyone answering me?
Just hang on. I've got a life of my own.

## Will you please speak to me! Theo?
Another minute.

## What about the others?
I kind of dropped them off. They were getting on my nerves.

## What are you doing now?
What do you think I'm doing? I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.

## How much time do you have left on it?
I don't know. 80 or 90 minutes, tops.

## Why didn't you do what your friends wanted and just -- get rid of me?
I don't know. I hung up on somebody else a long time ago, and later on I wished I hadn't of.

## Hey drop it, okay?
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.

## And that was the end of it?
I sure as hell got my wish. She doesn't exist. So maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.

## What do you do for a living?
Sometimes I paint.

## You're breaking up. I can't hear you. Theo?
There are cables overhead. Hang on. It'll clear up.

## Does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail?
That's not her.

## Does she wear glasses?
No.

## When Jack sees they've got Rachel HE'LL tell them what they want to know.
What's happening?

## You said they wanted to get into some particular safety deposit box?
The one in Brentwood.

## What bank?
The City National on San Vincente.

## What do you mean?
Black Mercedes, 600S.

## I'm not doing too well. What's the matter?
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.

## Even if you found us -- what then?
I'm cutting across to Bundy to Brentwood. That bank is our best bet. If anybody shows up I could follow them.

## Do you know what's in that box?
I'm not supposed to -- but I do. Millions in cash and bearer bonds.

## You're doing what you can. Why's all this money stashed?
To hide it from the I.R.S.

## What's going on?
The front door slammed. Someone went out. There's a different car starting.

## I might still get there first. The lights are with me. How would I identify the guy who shows up at the bank?
It won't be him.

## But I guess we haven't really met -- have we?
I've got a lot of respect for you too. For the way you feel about your family.

## Why tell me this?
Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.

## Did you jiggle the phone?
No.

## Try what you did before. It worked before. I won't talk anymore.
Did you hear that click?

## Hi Lenore. It's me. I got you back. Courtesy of Star 69. Are you hurt?
They dragged me downstairs. I thought they were going to kill me.

## What did you do?
I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy.

## Are you okay?
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.

## That's coming off. How about the girl?
She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it.

## You're all three of you in that van?
Yes.

## Don't start thinking about it. Is the tape off?
Yes.

## Can you walk?
Yes. But I want Rachel to come with me.

## Why can't it be her?
She's a child. She might panic. She doesn't know me. She might not come to me. She might just run.

## Why didn't you just shoot them?
Because a lot of people would've gotten killed. Probably all the wrong ones.

## You're going to let them get away with this?
We've almost got your husband and your daughter out. So don't get any ideas.

## They tortured us. And you're going to let them have all that money?
So far they're keeping their part of it.

## Somehow I got along better with you on the phone. It's all there isn't it?
Hand me the phone.

## The rest of the money is here in the car. Why don't you come and get it?
You're not Lenore Oberfeld.

## It belongs to the man you took it from. Or should I saw stole it from?
The guy with the transplant.

## Jack Oberfeld in person. Did you kill him?
Damned if I know.

## Who's in back?
L.A.P.D.

## Not all. They already have a third. The question is how much of that are they willing to give to get you back?
You won't shoot me. That's not your style.

## Do you have to point that?
Absolutely. And Topanga Canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if I recall.

## What's that supposed to me?
I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.

## You were at the Emerald that night?
Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.

## Did you hear that?
Let me talk to him. Hold the phone to my ear -- but don't nudge me.

## What's Nels' number?
259-7881.

## Do you think they'll walk away?
Ask them.

## I can't hear. Now there's a siren. They must be in an ambulance. What about the money? Nels?
Wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed.

## Any idea where you're going?
I was sentenced to a youth camp out here when I was fourteen. We cleared some of these same roads.

## Think you could do a picture of me?
I had it in my mind what you'd look like. \"Her,\" I could've painted. You, I'd be afraid to turn my back to mix the colors.

## Why are we stopping?
I need a break. I've been on a marathon run ever since I had the misfortune to strike up a conversation with you.

## You've had a lot of fun with me today. What would you have done if I hadn't responded to your call?
The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.

## What's your point?
We can't leave him to repeat anything.

## Which one of us is elected to do the deed?
You're the man with the gun.

## Exactly who was this Oberfeld?
Local lawyer for Dominican dealers. Off to buy a half interest in a mall in Granada Hills on their behalf.

## Know what else is in here?
Take your hand out of there. Slowly.

## Think about what's going to happen to your valuables when that trunk flies open at 75 miles per?
You won't live to see it.

## I picked the wrong number when I chose you ... didn't I?
Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.

## Who is this?
You mustn't hang up.

## I'm afraid I've used up all my good deeds for the day.
Didn't we play this scene before?

## I'm self employed. What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
Twenty percent.

## You're up on your details, aren't you?
Keep talking.

## It's a nice day. How about the beach?
Pass.

## It should take me twenty minutes. Where are you coming from?
We can be there.

## Got a phone in that van?
Sure.

## I'm here. Where are you?
We don't see you.

## Satisfied?
You already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work.

## And then?
And they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van.

## Are you trying to panic the women?
That's how it is. You see her approaching you toss out installment one.

## I'm tying it up in a bundle now. Where is she?
Stop the crying.

## She's yours. What are we waiting on?
I'm backing up.

## Yeah. Why don't we?
What are you planning to do when they got here? They'll kill us. They'll kill Rachel.

## Tailgate me. I'll jam on the brakes. You go into a spin to avoid an accident and cut them off.
Who am I talking to?

## You want us to get ourselves killed?
I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.

## Yeah?
Nels! Guess who? A friendly voice from beyond the grave.

## Who's this?
I thought you'd know me by now.

## Why would she want me to think you were on ice?
Intelligent question, Nels. I believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity.

## You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
That bitch. What's keeping you from taking off?

## Not without the name of the contact who can discount the bonds. I may need to pry that information out of her. What do you stand to gain?
Sweet revenge plus maybe a bit of vigorish off your end.

## How far off are you?
Five minutes.

## Where do I turn?
Have your cab wait at the foot of Cisco -- we'll ride up together.

## How do you know?
Believe me. They couldn't be busier at the moment.

## Where's the backpack?
None of your business, but it's in the cab. That's all mine. When we take from them, we divide, eighty-twenty.

## Are you busting my chops or what?
Somebody better tear this down before it falls down.

## Who were you talking to?
Them. They won't be expecting us.

## Since when did you guys start changing tires?
Only you don't have a flat.

## If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.

## Was I picking on you? How come you pulled in back of this fruitstand?
Tell the truth, I was going to take a much needed leak.

## Who are you?
Let me talk to the lady again.

## Government business?
Very official. 259-7881, if I recall.

## What kind of Treasury Dept. business is this?
Undercover.

## Where is this canyon house where you're supposed to hook up?
Let's have your name and address. The government will want to send you a letter of commendation.

## Scottish?
Yeah.

## Is that good or bad?
Well, you get to say, The usual, Col. Things like that.

## So who's he?
He's what she should run a mile from.

## Then why doesn't she?
Who knows the secrets of the human heart.

## How?
When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed.

## See what, Dil?
He gave me a look.

## Did he?
Just cut his hair, you know.

## What you think?
Nice.

## What would you call it?
Now, that was a look.

## What do you think his name is?
I've no thoughts on the subject.

## You see that, Col?
Saw it, Dil.

## Did I?
You fucking did.

## Who the fuck is he?
Jimmy.

## It's him, isn't it?
Maybe.

## He's going to take his foot off slowly, David. Then you're to go home, like a good boy. You hear me?
Cunt.

## Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy?
It's not Pat. It's Jim.

## Do you mean that?
He wants to know do I mean that.

## Is that his tart? Does Pat have a tart?
She's not a tart.

## What?
Whatever it is she does for you.

## What's that supposed to mean?
It's a simple question.

## How much did that frame cost, Mr. Franknum?
Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.

## Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back, will it, Mr. Franknum?
Not in my experience.

## Someone recommend you?
In a way.

## Who?
Guy I work with.

## What's it to you?
Nothing.

## You American?
No.

## How'd you guess?
The accent, I suppose.

## And what's it like?
Like treacle.

## Don't know. Who is she?
Tell her I'm very happy with it.

## Jimmy?
Everybody wants something.

## You old-fashioned?
Must be.

## What was that?
They all get the wrong idea.

## You all right?
Yes, thank you.

## What was that all about?
He wants me to perform for him.

## Perform?
You know.

## You on the game?
God no. I'm a hairdresser.

## Now, if you asked me to meet you tomorrow, it would really drive him insane.
You can't leave me then, can you?

## Where?
Half-five. At Millie's.

## What look?
The one you gave me in the Metro.

## What's that about?
They're jealous.

## Why?
I wonder.

## Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes?
Must be.

## Jesus.
You got a special friend, Jimmy?

## That Dave?
Yes, please.

## What'll it be?
Whiskey.

## Sorry. How'd he drive with his neck in a brace?
Must be in love to manage that.

## Tried to. Sit down, will you?
He was different.

## How different?
As different as it's possible to be.

## Shouldn't I go?
Yes...

## Are you jealous of him?
Maybe.

## What would he think?
Can't think. He's dead. In Ireland. He was a soldier. Went there like a fool.

## What do you think?
I think you do.

## Do I?
Like you're concerned.

## But you can t stay, you know that?
Didn't think I could.

## Shouldn't you be in mourning?
I am.

## Is this an obsession of yours?
Maybe.

## So what do you want with me, Jimmy?
Want to look after you.

## What does that mean?
Something I heard someone say once.

## You mean that?
Yeah.

## Why?
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.

## What is this?
I'm superstitious. Drink.

## The thing is, can you go the distance?
Depends what it is.

## What you thinking of, hon?
I'm thinking of your man.

## Why?
I'm wondering why you keep his things.

## Did he ever tell you you were beautiful?
Never let the sun go down on an argument, Jody used to say.

## What you doing here?
Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon.

## You're something else, Dil, you know that?
Never said a truer word.

## Do you care, Jimmy?
Sure I do.

## You mean that?
Yeah. I care, Dil.

## You think that's wise?
Nothing's wise.

## How?
Ask to meet me again.

## When?
Whenever. Tonight.

## Know what, honey?
Know what I didn't know. And don't call me that.

## I should have known, shouldn't I?
Probably.

## That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he?
Absolutely.

## Are you pretending yet?
I'm working on it.

## Am I becoming repetitious?
A little.

## Happy now?
Delirious.

## What?
He'd bring me carnations.

## You gonna tell me why?
No.

## What's her?
Yes.

## She from Scotland too?
You could say that.

## And you're not going to tell me more?
I can't.

## What you doing, Jimmy?
I'm not sure.

## Do you like me even a little bit?
More than that.

## You do something for me, Dil?
Anything.

## You'd do anything for me?
Afraid so.

## You want another haircut, baby?
No. Sit down.

## Why?
It's a secret.

## You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?
Yes.

## And you wouldn't leave me?
No.

## You promise?
I promise.

## What?
For me.

## Why are we going here, Jimmy?
Look on it like a honeymoon.

## You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil.
Dil! Dil! What the fuck are you doing here?

## You mean that?
Yes.

## You heard what I said, Dil?
My pills...

## What pills?
Prescription. For my condition.

## Are you supposed to take that many?
Only in times of extreme stress.

## Are you all right, Dil?
Don't go like that.

## You knew which man?
Your soldier.

## You knew my Jody?
Lifted him from a carnival in Belfast. Held him hostage for three days.

## Are you listening?
Yes.

## You killed my Jody?
In a manner of speaking.

## Don't you want to kill me?
Got to be somewhere.

## Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.
You like me now, Jimmy?

## More what?
More endearments.

## You do?
Yeah.

## What would you do for me?
Anything.

## And you'll never leave me?
Never.

## What was that she called you, Jimmy?
Fergus.

## And she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him, didn't she?
Yes. Now.

## Am I in trouble, Jimmy?
Not if you go.

## Promise?
I promise.

## Where am I to go, Jimmy?
The Metro.

## As the man said, it's in my nature.
I'm sorry, darling. I keep forgetting the leap year. What am I supposed to call you then, Jimmy?

## What's that supposed to mean?
Lucky you.

## Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?
That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.

## A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy?
You'll notice I've asked you nothing.

## So what do you need, Fergus?
Need to go across the water.

## Hey -- what's he like?
Horny bastard.

## Did you give him it?
There are certain things I wouldn't do for my country.

## What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up?
Leave me alone, Jude.

## Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
Suits you.

## No, what is the thing?
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.

## What do you mean?
We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.

## And then you'll leave her out of it?
Aye. Then we'll leave her be.

## And what if I say no?
You know what. Go.

## Was I?
Perfect.

## And what happens then?
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.

## And what if you don't?
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.

## Who's the old geezer?
Some judge...

## You a handyman, Fergie?
I take pride in my work.

## Do you want a cup of tea?
Made the front page. They'll move now, the fuckers.

## Why would you do that?
The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.

## So?
And anyway, he's seen our faces.

## You sure?
He described me down to a T. Knows what Jude looks like.

## What the fuck is this?
It's nothing. He's just got a sense of humor, that's all.

## So he knows your name?
I told him.

## You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?
Yes.

## Why?
Because tomorrow we might have to shoot him, that's why.

## I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
Good. I was beginning to have my doubts about you for the last few days.

## Why do you want to do that for?
Would make me feel better about it.

## You sure about that?
I'm sure.

## Who'd you think it was?
I thought it was Dave.

## And who's Dave when he's at home?
He's at home.

## Should blow you away, you know that?
I know that.

## I'm getting emotional. And I don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy?
Definitely unusual.

## And who is she?
Just a girl.

## And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
Aye, I do, Peter.

## Who is he?
Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we would call a legitimate target.

## You being cynical, Hennessy?
Hope not.

## Good. So what do you think?
Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. And I presume you can't get in.

## Kind of suicide, isn't it?
Fuck you.

## Eat something, would you?
Can't.

## What do you mean you can't?
Can't eat through a canvas bag.

## How is it a farce?
I seen your fucking face.

## So, what do I look like?
You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face.

## Am I?
Yeah. And the brown eyes.

## How did you know it was her?
I can smell her perfume.

## Can't we take it off?
Now, if you took the ropes off, I'd be able to feed myself.

## What's that?
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.

## No?
Nope. Not handsome at all.

## You trying to hurt my feelings?
No. It's the truth.

## Could you?
Kill me.

## What makes you think that?
They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.

## You want to bet?
I'm not a gambling man.

## Why can't we?
Not in your nature.

## What do you know about my nature?
I'm talking about your people, not you.

## What the fuck do you know about my people?
Only that you're all tough undeluded motherfuckers. And that it's not in your nature to let me go.

## No, what's the funny thing?
I didn't even fancy her.

## What?
My inside pocket.

## Why not?
She's mine. Anyway, she wouldn't suit you.

## No?
Absolutely not.

## She your wife?
Suppose you could say that.

## She's a friend of mine
So what were you fucking around for, then?

## What?
What the fuck am I doing here.

## What the fuck were you doing here?
I got sent.

## Why did you sign up?
It was a job. So I get sent to the only place in the world they call you nigger to your face.

## That game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?
Best game in the world.

## How different?
Toffs' game there. But not at home. .

## Well then, you're going to have to take my dick out for me, aren t you?
Now, that was worth waiting for.

## Hurry up, would you?
These things take time, Fergus.

## Shut up, would you?
I'm sorry. Didn't mean to offend you, Fergus.

## Yeah?
Thanks. I know that wasn't easy for you.

## So what's that supposed to mean?
Means what it says. The scorpion does what is in his nature. Take off the hood, man.

## Why?
Cause you're kind. It's in your nature.

## Where would you most like to be now, man?
Doesn't matter where.

## Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita.
Like what?

## Who's Dil?
My special friend.

## Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
We don't look on it like that.

## What do you believe in?
That you guys shouldn't be here.

## It's as simple as that?
Yes.

## No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
I didn't.

## Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus. Will you think of her too?
Don't know her.

## Help me.
What?

## How can I?
I don't know. Just help me. Give me a cigarette.

## What?
A story.

## Like the one about the frog?
And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.

## Yeah?
I thought as a child. But when I became a man I put away childish things...

## What does that mean?
Nothing.

## Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus?
Me? No, I'm not good for much...

## Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus?
The fastest.

## Faster than cricket?
Cricket's in the halfpenny place.

## So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there?
No, fuck the bear. The name. Jude. And it's June. Jude in June.

## What if I did?
You'd know I wouldn't run off.

## Nice lady.
You didn't?

## Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love.
Have you no feelings, woman?

## Give me the fucking shooter!
That true, Fergus? You in love?

## Where are you, ol' buddy?
I'll tell you what, fella -- you want t' find me, you jus' turn 'round -- from now on I'll be right behind you.

## All right -- where's the letter?
The letter? The letter ain't worth nuthin'.

## How was I leading you on?
No -- I guess not.

## Don't you know I'm having a tough time keeping my eyes off of you?
Oh, you should see your face.

## What about it?
It's lovely.

## You don't look so bad in this light.
What's the matter?

## Why do you think I brought you here?
I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.

## Aren't you allowed to kiss back?
No. The doctor said it would be bad for my -- thermostat.

## There's no time -- I'll call you in the morning.
You're going to look for him -- now?

## What is it?
Open up.

## Why?
Lord, you're stubborn.

## Can you remember anything at all?
Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.

## Of course there is!
Five o'clock -- Thursday -- the Garden -- it's got to be something around here.

## Tex? You mean he's here, too?
Look.

## Can I really believe you this time, Adam?
There's not a reason on earth why you should.

## I'm sorry I thought you were the murderer, Adam -- how did I know that he was as big a liar as you are?
And that's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide.

## What a terrible thing to say. How could you even think that?
Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.

## Mr. Bartholomew -- are you sure you know who I am?
Charles Lampert's widow -- yes? Last time I sent out a tie only the spot came back.

## I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.

## You mean spies and things like that?
Only we call them agents.

## Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business.
We? You mean you're --?

## What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew?
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.

## May I have a sandwich, please?
To be more specific, he was wanted by this agency.

## His -- real -- ?
Very sweet.

## Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.

## Then whose is it? His or theirs?
Ours.

## Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
Yes, where? -- in fifteen minutes. I'll be there.

## Were you followed?
Yes, but I lost him. I really did it quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to think women make the best spies.

## Who?
Dyle, or whatever his name is.

## What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.

## No, what?
That's not Carson Dyle.

## Carson?
There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson.

## Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle?
I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.

## I suppose you're old enough to have heard of World War Two?
Barely, yes.

## Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the French Underground --
Can I at least keep the onion soup?

## Scobie was able to travel, but Carson Dyle was clearly dying, so they --
May I have a cigarette, please?

## But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?
We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof.

## But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.?
C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.

## Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do?
We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.

## Me? Why me?
You're in an ideal position -- he trusts you. Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies.

## Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
Yes -- ?

## Are you sure there's no mistake?
None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- be careful.

## Calm down, Mrs. Lampert -- please. Does he have the money?
Yes, I'm leaving now -- goodbye.

## He looks so young -- when was this taken?
1944. The next face, please.

## Does the name Tex Penthollow mean anything to you?
No.

## Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?
No, thank heaven.

## When did you see him -- what time, I mean?
Around one.

## Bartholomew?
-- recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour.

## What's your first name today?
Brian.

## Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?
Yes.

## But you're -- divorced?
No.

## If you do anything funny, or try to talk to anyone, I'll kill you, Dyle -- here and now. Okay?
You'll wreck your raincoat.

## What now?
We wait -- with our mouths shut.

## How long do you intend -- ?
I said with the mouth shut.

## Do I knock or something?
Open it.

## I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?
Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? She has it -- you know that.

## Back where?
That's the idea.

## Then who does?
I don't know, Herman -- maybe you do.

## That's a crock! If one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up.
Me?

## Good morning, Mr. Dyle.
He's just tryin' to throw us off! They've got it, I tell you! Why don't we search their rooms?

## No cat and mouse -- you've got me. What do you want to know?
Why you lied to me.

## Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to -- What happened?
I met a man with sharp nails.

## Scobie?
I left him hanging around the American Express.

## Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
Sure.

## Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
Yes, but we're divorced.

## Alex -- how can you tell if someone is lying or not?
You can't.

## Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
Because he's wearing moccasins.

## Which one are you?
Whitefoot, of course.

## Why can't you be serious?
There, you said it.

## Okay -- I'll tell you what -- we'll just sit around all day long being frivolous -- how about that?
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.

## What are you doing?
Cutting it out.

## Who told you to do that?
You did.

## What day is it?
Tuesday.

## Come on -- let's get busy. Who gets your vote?
Scobie -- he's the one that objected.

## Reggie -- ? Did you find it?
No.

## Who do you think did it -- Gideon?
Maybe.

## Or Tex?
Maybe.

## You're a big help. Can I have one of those?
I think Tex did it.

## Why?
Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.

## What's so illogical about that?
Oh. I guess they just can't help it.

## What -- like Scobie?
I'm scared.

## Got you.
What? Assassinate somebody?

## Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
The shower's in there.

## What are you doing?
Have you ever heard of anyone taking a shower with his shoes on? What a nut.

## The suit needs it more than I do, anyway.
I usually sing a medley of old favorites when I bathe -- any requests?

## How often do you go through this little ritual?
Every day. The manufacturer recommends it.

## I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me?
Nothing's going to happen to you while I'm around -- I want you to believe that.

## What do I have to do to satisfy you -- become the next victim?
It's a start, anyway.

## I can explain if you'll just listen. Will you listen?
I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.

## Are you going to listen?
Go on.

## I suppose all this is leading somewhere?
It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.

## You mean, you're a thief?
I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.

## Have you ever, in your entire life, seen anything so beautiful?
I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.

## How much is it worth?
The money is unimportant.

## In human life? In greed? In suffering?
In money.

## Do you have anything to eat? And the orange one -- what about the orange one?
A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps.

## You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur Flix -- are they for sale now?
Here's ten.

## You sure nuthin's missin'?
No. The police have kindly provided us with a list.

## Meaning what?
You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.

## It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?
I don't know anything.

## You loved him?
I'm very cold.

## Leave?
Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven.

## He was American?
Swiss.

## Oh. Swiss. His profession?
He didn't have one.

## He was a wealthy man?
I don't know. I suppose so.

## About how wealthy would you say?
I don't know.

## Where did he keep his money?
I don't know.

## Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?
I don't know.

## Is it all right?
I wish you wouldn't.

## Did you?
If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.

## One more question. Is this your husband's passport?
Of course it is.

## And this?
I don't understand.

## And this? And this?
I was, too.

## In Mr. Dyle's room?
No -- in my room.

## It stands to reason you are telling the truth -- for why would you invent such a ridiculous story?
Okay.

## Come on, now -- if you wanted to hide something, where would you put it?
I know. I would bury it in the garden.

## Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- ! What's that?
A man traded with me -- all those for only four.

## Oh no! What man, Jean-Louis -- where?
But he is gone.

## I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur Flix lives?
No -- but I will ask.

## I don't know -- how would I know?
I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.

## You give up awfully easy, don't you?
Clever fellow -- almost missed me.

## The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
Peter Joshua.

## Is there a Mr. Lampert?
Yes.

## Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
Yes, but we're divorced.

## Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities. What do people call you -- Pete?
Mr. Joshua. Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.

## Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said, \"When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again\"?
Shakespeare never said that.

## How do you know?
It's terrible -- you just made it up.

## Are you in the book?
Charles is.

## What are you doing here?
I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.

## How did you find out?
It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.

## Where did everything go?
Charles sold it all -- at auction.

## Do you know what you're going to do?
Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.

## Instant divorce you mean?
Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.

## Something modest but clean -- and near enough to UNESCO so you can take a cab when it rains -- okay?
Hallo, Peter.

## Don't you understand French?
I'm still having trouble with English.

## What was all that?
Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.

## Lay on, MacDuff.
You mean you and me?

## What are you doing in here?
Having a nervous breakdown.

## You haven't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there?
I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.

## Who said?
That's what I'm not supposed to say.

## What was what?
We're here.

## Where?
On the street where you live.

## How would you like a spanking?
How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.

## What?
Nothing. Good night.

## I think I sprained my pride. Where'd he go?
Out of the window, I guess -- I didn't see him.

## What?
A quarter of a million dollars.

## No, it isn't -- where's the money?
I don't know. Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.

## Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.

## Who is it?
The man you had the fight with.

## What'd he say?
He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.

## What are you talking about?
You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.

## Yes?
Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.

## Wha -- what do you want?
Va jouer, mon ange.

## But what?
I don't know how to explain it. I'm just too miserable.

## But why do you want a divorce?
Because I don't love him.

## Don't you want me to stay?
It's not exactly what I'd call a large turn-out.

## Didn't Charles have any friends?
Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow. If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him.

## Have you no idea who could have done it?
Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name -- now it turns out I didn't even know that.

## Do you know him?
I've never seen him before.

## How can you tell?
He's allergic to him.

## Who is it from?
The American Embassy.

## What is it about?
Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.

## What's he up to?
He was so excited -- when he got the stamps you gave him this morning. He said he had never seen any like them.

## Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.
I'm glad. But what's all this?

## Yeah? What's that?
He took care of Charlie for us.

## Who invited you?
I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.

## Why?
He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.

## You do?
Can I come in? I'll need to use the phone.

## I wonder why it's so important to know if they fucked?
What I don't understand is why they asked Marliston if Rod was a virgin. They could have asked you Cindy.

## If I'm so all-used-up Ben, why do you try to hook me up non-stop?
As fucking if.

## WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
Your mind is just twisted enough. I believe you'd do all this just to get a dip or two.

## That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
No.

## Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston?
She's my daughter, Tom.

## So?
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.

## Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows?
If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today.

## is there anything you do?
I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m.

## How well did you know Stacy and Rod?
I've been in the same class with Stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything.

## Had either of them broken up with someone recently? Hurt someone?
No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now.

## I will. Is that all?
Hi honey.

## What's wrong?
I have a question to ask you. A personal question.

## Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.

## I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
A little.

## Not much further.
How much further?

## You never went, uh, all the way?
Ok.

## Are you sure?
She said she was Kenny's aunt Lisa.

## You know her?
It can't be.

## Who is she Daddy?
Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today.

## What did you hear?
The same type that decides to carve into her stomach.

## You found her?
There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.

## Are you sure?
We're seeing all the signs in town.

## What happened?
Two kids were found mutilated in the woods. Lock the door after me.

## Is Jody still awake?
She just turned off her light.

## Well?
She's still a virgin.

## Did you warn her?
No. Let her get at least one more peacefully night's sleep.

## What are you doing?
This will relax her.

## Hello?
I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.

## You know where I can find her?
St. Michael's.

## She works at a church?
She resides there. Out back. She died a year and a half ago.

## Of what?
A bullet to the right cerebellum.

## She was murdered?
No. She ate a pistol for lunch one day.

## Can you describe her? How old was she?
I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.

## Can you get inside?
I can.

## No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her?
No.

## Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh?
No, you couldn't.

## Really?
Yeah. You should check downstairs.

## Why?
Your brother told us.

## You're not?
No. I couldn't do that. I have something for you.

## Jesus. Any word from Brent?
Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What he wants us to do. I'll head over to the school.

## But I shouldn't shut it down?
No. Hell, it's the quietest goddamn party I've ever seen.

## What?
You gave me a 'D'.

## Can you just follow me? The back is full?
Sure.

## of COURSE. You're not scared?
Of course I'm scared.

## You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?
I really do. For your own safety.

## Really?
Yes. We have no real freedom. You of all people should understand that. This may sting.

## Me? Why me?
Because of your father. The way what his sins shaped you.

## What do you know about my father?
He's a rapist. Like mine.

## Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
Yes.

## You think you're my sister?
Go sit next to him.

## Who?
Mark Shale.

## Why?
Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday.

## Does she fuck?
I doubt it. Who'd want to fuck her. She probably reeks worse than the docks down in those panties.

## What?
Mark invited me to the party.

## Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?
No.

## You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.

## Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time?
I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.

## Stag?
Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.

## They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
Twenty eight years ago.

## You heard about that?
Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP IN THE LIBARY. Kids were whispering about it all day.

## Don't you think it's sick?
Not at all. In fact, I thought about going.

## Unfortunately I qualify. Think I'm too old?
No.

## Why?
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.

## What?
Jody, we've been going out for over a year. I love you but I'm all out of patience.

## Are you O.K.?
I'm fine.

## I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
Yeah. I think it's really sick.

## Why?
Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.

## Did Sharon say no?
You know I want to go with you.

## So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
I don't know. I kind of am.

## Are you coming to the party?
Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now.

## What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?
Just making me feel like a piece of meat.

## I'm making you feel like meat?
Yeah.

## What?
I'm scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go to this party.

## What are you doing?
Pretend we're just another couple.

## Yes?
I need to ask you something.

## Yeah. Who is she?
I don't know. Where did you hear that name.

## What?
That's what he said.

## Did he say anything else about her?
No but he got really weird. Like I've never seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight.

## Where are you going?
The library. I'll be fine.

## Who is she?
She's nobody you should be concerned with.

## What?
I'm not leaving. I want to know why you and dad are so freaked out. Three of my classmates are dead.

## Attacked how?
She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.

## You didn't believe her?
No, I believed her. She was in pretty bad shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally charged.

## And the police did nothing?
EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.

## How could you?
I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.

## The men. Do any of them still live around here?
Two men left town right after it happened.

## The principal?
Yes.

## Who was the fourth?
Yeah.

## Kenny's aunt?
Yes. He asked me to come over and talk to you.

## On what side of the family?
His mother's side.

## You ok?
Just thinking about something.

## What?
There's going to be very few virgins left in school on Monday. It could be really dangerous for them if the killer isn't caught.

## What are you doing?
I got to go.

## What?
I'm worried about someone.

## And she didn't?
Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben.

## Did you want one?
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.

## Aren't you worried you could die a virgin?
Yeah. I'm extremely worried about that. It's right up there with global warming.

## What, do you work for my boss, dog?
Okay, okay.

## INT. ICE CREAM TRUCK/CAB - DAWN.
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY.

## Where's Sam?
Sam? Andy gave Sam a nice big desk to park his fat ass behind.

## Where do you want this stuff?
Freezer in the back.

## Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'?
Uh, between this month and last month, you owe four hundred and seventeen dollars. And we need that in cash.

## ...Darlene pay you in cash?
Since today. New policy.

## Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.
Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.

## Hey, you and I are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'.
Well, he told me to collect cash.

## Uh, huh?
Except for the fact that I need cash.

## Huh?
Well, Darlene usually gives me a signed check for emergencies. I could always give you that.

## Why don't I--?
No, no, no, no, no, no. Wait.

## What did I say?
Dude in uniform get in your face, you do not shoot your mouth off.

## Wait, wait. You don't believe the dead guy, do...
No, no, no. You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...

## ...ya?
Yeah, I believe him. He was my friend.

## Wait, wait, wait. Hold up. Hold up. Look.
Wait, wait, wait. Hold up. Hold up. Look.

## You want cash?
I got, like, uh....

## All right, then how about this?
Hey, you're gonna piss me-- What the hell are you supposed to be...

## Would you hurry up, please?
Look, put this in the back. Keep it safe.

## ...up.
There we go. There we go. Did you keep it safe? Did you

## Are you kiddin'?
Are you kiddin'?

## Damn.
Come on!

## What the hell's goin' on?
It happens to this piece of shit...

## Do you wanna give me a minute?
God-...

## Shut up.
You're nuts, goin' back there!

## Doesn't work.
Take your gun!

## What?
Doesn't...

## Okay! All right!
Elvis is on ice again.

## Kiss my ass!
Probably because they know a psycho when they hear one.

## You wanna hit me?
And I'm a peaceful man, and...

## ...you stole the truck to uphold your principles, right?
I did not steal the truck.

## Hey! Hey! Andy's Ice Cream.
It was owed to me. You stole the damn...

## ...up!
Oh!

## Fuck!
Come on, old...

## Hey, and what if we don't make it?!
Oh, shit.

## I don't think we have much of a choice...
Your weedkiller on steroids goes down with us! Everybody dies!

## ...do we?
Oh, shit.

## Shit. You gotta pass him.
Come on...

## Okay. That didn't work.
Gee, you think so?

## Shut up!
Gee, you think so?

## ...shit!
Ho, ho...

## Oh, shit. It's okay. Okay.
No. Shit.

## Aw, shit
Okay.

## All right, let's go.
All right, let's go.

## Okay. All right. Okay.
Okay. All right. Okay.

## I'm crazy?
Taking it down the hill.

## I don't want you to come anyway.
You're not dangerous! You're crazy! I ain't gettin' in this damn thing!

## Oh, shit.
What?

## Okay. Okay.
Keep still.

## Uh-oh.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

## What?
This thing just went up a degree. Ice cream's not workin'.

## Hey, you didn't happen to lock the truck up when you got out...
Hey, you didn't happen to lock the truck up when you got out...

## ...did you?
You're fucked, man.

## ...-tion?
Hey, I didn't steal the truck. You...

## You know what I'm sayin'?
I deserve a lot more than that truck! Ten years, ten years I busted my ass for that fat rat bastard.

## Robert Del Rio?
Listen, Arlo...

## Like I said, I got a pretty good idea of what's at stake here.
Ow!

## They're takin' off.
Hey!

## Huh?
We're gonna die!

## Put your hand in my pants.
Put your hand in my pants.

## What?
What?

## Reach into my pocket.
We're gonna die, and you want me to do some freaky shit like that?!

## Okay.
Come on!

## Okay. All right, man. Okay.
Okay. All right, man. Okay.

## All right. Okay.
Okay.

## Okay.
Okay.

## Arlo!
Arlo!

## I'm sorry. I'm a little
I'm sorry. I'm a little

## Okay.
Okay.

## Okay, here we go.
Come on, come on!

## Go, go, go!
You just can't leave that stuff with that lu-...

## ...to him.
...-natic.

## Go!
What?

## Stop.
Stop.

## ...on!
Shoot me.

## What's it say?
Forty-nine point four.

## What?
It's melting, man.

## All right
Oh.

## Come on. Come on.
What?

## What?
It's working.

## Vitelli! Vitelli!
We got-...

## Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Can we get out on your end of the tunnel?

## Sorry.
Hang on, hang on.

## Why'd you stay behind?!
Look out.

## Well.
Elvis is still in there! It's gonna go off!

## You know, we saved half a million people from a full-body peel.
You know, we saved half a million people from a full-body peel.

## Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey. We are heroes, my man. It's time to start actin' like it.
We're the shit. Bigtime.

## Who drove the ice cream...
Stop limpin' around like that.

## Who had to put a gun to your head?
Who put the big hurt on...

## ...that Army nut job to save your narrow butt?
You, Arlo.

## ...face\" crap you've been telling me?
I was not in the man's face. I was nego-...

## That was quick.
Uh, he handled rackets, and I carried the balls.

## It's for you.
To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center. Maybe you know him. Richard Long.

## What'd he say?
Listen, shithead!

## Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?
Three seconds. One...

## Hey!
And it won't be pleasant.

## Well, that just about figures for today.
Well, that just about figures for today.

## ANDY So...where's my truck?
It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five.

## I ain't got time to argue with you today, Andy. But I can tell you this. Takin' your truck pissed you off?
Why don't you get that tub of shit Sam to...

## ...here. Mason...
...help you?

## You got a prob-...
...about the man who did this, he's-he's comin' after it.

## ...-lem too?
No, sir. I've never seen this guy before.

## What the hell's a sage?
Colonel Vitelli. We got a busted-in cold vault inside.

## Is it--?
Looks like it. Yes, sir.

## Any of them Richard Long?
No, sir.

## Sweeney tells me you don't have computer confirmation?
...-lar.

## Look, this is a scientific experiment, okay?
If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine. I don't think I need to mention you could use the help.

## ...about--
Is this stool taken?

## Grateful?
Mm-hm.

## ...always done, Richard?
Forget about him.

## ...happen if I drop this?
Radio the bikes.

## You have no idea what you're in possession of, do you?
EXT. MOUNTAINTOP - DAY.

## ...-ther orders?
We're gonna use them for demonstration footage.

## Mind if you tell me what's goin' on?
I'm Colonel Brynner, U.S. Special Operations Com-...

## You know the suspect?
Yeah, he's wanted in connection with a death this morning at the Jerome...

## ...screwup?
Uh, with all due respect, sir, Dr. Long told me to prep the field for detonation at...

## ...gear?
It's a hundred degrees...

## ...out here, captain. Don't you think the guys deserve a break?
They'll get a break tomorrow.

## Is this your establishment?
Yeah, they call me Dar-...

## Well, then, how about a cup of coffee, Darlene?
Iced coffee.

## I beg your pardon?
Uh, you wanna hunt outta season, it's cool with me. But mostly, well, they just take a six...

## Like I say, Doc Long's...
Odd, then, that his car...

## Yeah?
Contrary to what Dr. Long may have told you, this is neither...

## ...never done a thing for you?
Your fellow hero, untouched...

## It won't be long, gentlemen.
It won't be long, gentlemen.
## ...checked.
No.

## I would've in another life.
Why? You're a nothing, nobody! Why?

## They took that life away and left me with nothing.
Goddamn it, Ma-...

## ...-time, remember?
Oh. Well, I have got to get to the dentist be-...

## Yeah?
Be sure you feed Bosco.

## Oh, no?
Oh, you're two of a kind, doc. Oh, he may not have your sheepskins, and...

## EXT. DAM - DAY.
You know, I have yet to get a simple cup of coffee and a meal in this place, Darlene.

## Sir, I got Taipei grindin' on me here. How long is this supposed to ta--?
EXT. DAM - DAY.

## Forty-nine?
INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.

## Colonel, sir, who the hell is this guy?
Negative. Negative.

## Pappas, that other guy was unloading ice cream into a freezer. Now, what could he have to do with a military scientist, huh?
The sooner you get up the lab, the sooner you'll figure it out.

## And where are you going?
After that re-...

## Have you I.D.'d the bodies?
Well, I've got Dr. Long's body down at the coroner's office.

## Who's your suspect?
A man named Tim Ma-...

## Couldn't sleep, Pumper. Is everything, uh, all right tonight?
There's nothin' goin' on out there, doc...except maybe the occasional fly fisherman.

## Excellent.
Hey, doc. Might wanna...

## Been trying to figure out your secret.
Been trying to figure out your secret.

## My secret?
Yeah. Ten months we've been fishin' this river together. We use the same equipment, more or less...

## How can we ever hope to win against the trout?
Call an ambulance.

## Cold? Cold. How cold?
Never let it reach fifty degre-degrees.

## And what if it does?
Well, Costello's finished with the stability profile, but Abbott is still chewing on the load file.

## I don't know. Um, he's working, but there's a lot of data. Maybe...another hour?
We don't have an hour. We're already supposed to be shut down.

## ...you, Mason?
Yeah, yeah...

## ...Mason?
I'm at mile marker...

## ...uh, drifting around like the trash you are, or were you here workin'?
If it was Wednesday night, I was workin'.

## Do you recognize this young man?
Nope. Is there a prob-...

## ...-lem?
You find yourself wearing a...

## Got that?
So you don't remember...

## Lying?
Mason, you wouldn't know the truth if it bit you. We've got your whole record. We know about the-the conviction for vagrancy...

## What happened to Colonel Brynner?
The Army, sealin' us in.

## You sure?
EXT. ICE CREAM TRUCK - DAY.

## Heat's murder.
INT. TUNNEL/AIR VENT - DAY.

## Barney, who is this bimbo? He a regular customer?
Take it easy, Jake.

## How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?
Land sales out of escrow are always recorded within the week.

## Then these are all new owners?
That's right.

## Can I check one of these volumes out?
Sir, this is not a lending library, it's the Hall of Records.

## A ruler?
The print's pretty fine. I forgot my glasses. I'd like to be able to read across.

## Sir?
I said horseshit. Horseshit.

## Always?
You know, you've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like that.

## How did she get that idea?
I think I gave it to her.

## Tell me. What do the police say?
They're calling it an accident.

## Who's the investigating officer?
Lou Escobar  he's a Lieutenant.

## Do you know him?
Oh yes.

## Where from?
We worked in Chinatown together.

## Would you call him a capable man?
Very.

## Honest?
Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.

## Of course, but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case?
None.

## Too bad?
My usual fee, plus a bonus if I come up with any results.

## Are you sleeping with her? Come, come, Mr. Gittes. You don't have to think about that to remember, do you?
If you want an answer to that question I can always put one of my men on the job. Good afternoon, Mr. Cross.

## What for?
You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't.

## Why is that funny?
It's what the D.A. used to tell me about Chinatown.

## ...Exactly what do you know about me, Mr. Gittes?
Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.

## His girlfriend?
Yes, his girlfriend.

## Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
Yeah.

## Doesn't that strike you as odd?
No. She's probably scared to death.

## Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
Maybe.

## You didn't see Mulwray much, did you?
No.

## When was the last time?
Sheriff's gold posse... bunch of damn fools who pay $5,000 apiece to the sheriff's reelection. I let 'em practice up out here.

## Yeah. Do you remember the last time you talked to Mulwray?
At my age, you tend to lose track...

## I've got the photographs in my office. If they'll help you remember. What was the argument about?
My daughter.

## What about her?
Just find the girl, Mr. Gittes. I think she is frightened and I happen to know Hollis was fond of her. I'd like to help her if I can.

## How did you find out?
I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town.

## Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
Just find the girl.

## Avocado groves?
We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.

## Is she all right?
She's fine.

## Where is she?
With her mother.

## An obituary column... can you read in this light?
Yes... I think I can manage...

## What does this mean?
That you killed Hollis Mulwray.

## Hollie was always fond of tide-pools. You know what he used to say about them?
Haven't the faintest idea.

## And that's what you were going to do in the Valley?
There's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting.

## How do you do that?
Just incorporate the Valley into the city so the water goes to L.A. after all. It's very simple.

## I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
Oh, my, yes.

## Who do you blame for that? Her?
Hello.

## Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?
Either that or she'll be in jail.

## What are you talking about?
Just bring your checkbook.

## What's that, Curly?
I think I'll kill her.

## Oh they don't?
Not for your wife. That's the unwritten law.

## What kind of guy do you think I am?
Thanks, Mr. Gittes.

## Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?
No thanks.

## Curly, where's your car?
In the garage.

## Where's that?
Off the alley.

## Could you drive me somewhere?
Sure, as soon as we eat.

## How much do you owe me, Curly?
Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick.

## Plus what I owe you?
I'll throw that in too.

## You sure this is okay?
Curly, you know how long I been in business.

## Then what'll you do?
Sue the shit out of 'em.

## Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?
I'm not.

## Where did you get this material?
The apple core club.

## The apple core?
No. The albacore. It's a fish. My grandson's a member and they take very nice care of us.

## But what?
Hello, Jake.

## How are you, Lou?
I have a cold I can't seem to shake but other than that, I'm fine.

## How'd you get past the guards?
Well, to tell you the truth, I lied a little.

## Since when?
Since I made Lieutenant.

## Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
Looking for someone.

## Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?
Oh yes.

## Or her name?
No.

## No?
No. It was an accident.

## Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
When I do, you'll hear about it.

## How do you happen to know her?
I don't.

## Isn't that your number?
Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.

## You really think I'm stupid, don't you, Gittes?
I don't think about it one way or the other. But if you want, give me a day or two, and I'll get back to you. Now I'd like to go home.

## What pictures?
This broad hired you, Gittes, not Evelyn Mulwray.

## Yeah?
Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray, she hired you, and that's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered.

## You accusing me of extortion?
Absolutely.

## And why's that?
He found out somebody was dumping water there. That's what they were trying to cover up by moving him.

## What are you talking about?
C'mon I'll show you.

## Too late for what?
They only dump the water at night.

## I don't suppose you got any idea Where she went?
Matter of fact I do.

## Where?
Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.

## What's the maid's address?
She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down for you.

## What for?
If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.

## That's it?
Yeah.

## You never learn, do you, Gittes?
I guess not.

## Jake, you're very disturbed. You're crazy. That's her father.
An accident?

## It looks like he was washed the entire length of the runoff channel. Could he swim?
Of course.

## But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
No.

## Mrs. Mulwray, do you happen to know the name of the young woman in question?
No.

## You and your husband never discussed her?
He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name. We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.

## A complete surprise?
Yes.

## A private investigator?
Mr. Gittes.

## Will you need me for anything else, Lieutenant?
I don't think so, Mrs. Mulwray. Of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information, we'll be in touch.

## Not that Mulwray?
Now wait a minute, Mrs. Mulwray...

## What are you having?
Iced tea.

## What?
I said I'll drop it.

## Yes, Mr. Gittes?
I don't want to drop it.

## May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.

## It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
No. I went riding rather early.

## A check?
I got your check in the mall.

## Well, how much would you like?
Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.

## I have?
I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.

## How did you find out?
My husband.

## And you weren't the slightest bit upset about it?
I was grateful.

## Unless what?
Mr. Gittes.

## Did he know?
Well I wouldn't run home and tell him whenever I went to bed with someone, if that's what you mean.

## Is there anything else you want to know?
Where you were when your husband died.

## You mean you don't know where you were?
I mean I can't tell you.

## For very long?
K... Cross.

## Yes... why?
No reason.

## How did it happen?
Been meaning to talk to you about that.

## Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
More like other people putting their business in my nose.

## Another satisfied client?
Another satisfied client's wife.

## Whoever's behind my husband's death, why have they gone to all this trouble?
Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know.

## Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he?
Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.

## So you married your father's business partner?
You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray.

## Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father?
No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...

## Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?
Then it was over the water department.

## Oh, yeah?
Yes. He never forgave him for it.

## Never forgave him for what?
For talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... They haven't spoken to this day.

## You sure shout that?
Of course I'm sure.

## What are you thinking?
Before this I turned on the faucet, it came out hot and cold, I didn't think there was a thing to it.

## What dam?
The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.

## Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today. That bother you?
No.

## Know him?
No, I think I'd remember.

## And Hollis knew about it?
It's why he was killed. Jasper Lamar Crabb. Jasper Lamar Crabb.

## What? What is it?
There was a memorial service at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He died three weeks ago.

## Is that unusual?
Two weeks ago he bought those 25,000 acres. That's unusual.

## Why?
What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all.

## What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time.

## Why?
Just. I don't know why. I'm asking.

## What were you doing there?
Working for the District Attorney.

## Doing what?
As little as possible.

## The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
They do in Chinatown.

## Hold still. Why?
You can't always tell what's going on there.

## What's wrong?
Your eye.

## What about it?
There's something black in the green part of your eye.

## Where?
Just... I have to.

## Where are you going?
The Albacore Club.

## He owns it. You know?
I saw him.

## You saw my fa... father? When?
This morning.

## What did he say? What did he say?
That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.

## Do? To who?
Mulwray's girlfriend, for one thing. He wanted to know where she was.

## That's what your father said. You're telling me he's in back of this whole thing?
It's possible.

## Including the death of your husband?
It's possible. Please don't ask me any more questions now. Just wait, wait for me. I'll be back. I need you here.

## She's too upset.
The police?

## What about?
Hollis' death. I tried to keep it from her, I didn't want her upset before I could make plans for her to leave.

## You mean she just found out?
Yes.

## What does it look like?
Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell.

## You won't go to the police if I tell you?
I will if you don't.

## Because of Hollis? Because she was seeing your husband? Was that it? Jesus Christ, say something. Was that it?
I took your husband's Buick... I'll return it tomorrow.

## Aren't you coming back with me?
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.

## Did you get some sleep?
Sure.

## Upstairs. Why?
I want to see her.

## You're going to miss your train! Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can.
...she's having a bath now... why do you want to see her?

## You know any good criminal lawyers?
No...

## I found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. They belonged to your husband, didn't they?... didn't they?
I don't know. I mean yes, probably.

## What are you saying?
I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever...

## That's good. Now what's her name?
Katherine.

## Katherine?... Katherine who?
She's my daughter.

## Yeah... where are you taking her now?
Back to Mexico.

## How about a plane?
That's worse... Just get out of here. Walk out, leave everything.

## ...where does Kyo live?
With us.

## How do you know?
He didn't wear bifocals.

## Walsh here?
He's in the dark room.

## Where'd he go yesterday?
Three reservoirs. Men's room of a Richfield gas station on Flower, and the Pig 'n Whistle.

## Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't it?
Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.

## Isn't everybody? What can I do for you, Miss Sessions?
Well, I'm a working girl, Mr. Gittes. I didn't come in to see you on my own.

## Shut the fuck up! ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying?
I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.

## ...Why don't you give me your address and we can talk this over?
No, Mr. Gittes. Just look in the obituary column of today's Times...

## The obituary column?
You'll find one of those people.

## Who?
Ida Sessions.

## Do you accept anyone of the Jewish persuasion?
I'm sorry. We don't.

## Just to be certain, I wonder if you could show us a list of your patients?
We don't reveal the names of our guests as a matter of policy. I know you'd appreciate that if your father came to live with us.

## I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
I don't think so. Be happy to show you.

## Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime.

## And Mulwray isn't?
He never even kids about it.

## Help yourself.
You don't happen to know where Mr. Mulwray's having lunch?

## Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you. Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?
Hope so. He's working for us.

## Oh yes. Hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. My goodness, what happened to your nose?
I cut myself shaving.

## Only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray?
I never was.

## Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?
I said, the northwest valley.

## You're a married man, am I right?
Yes...

## Do you know me?
Well... I think I... I would've remembered.

## Have we ever met?
Well, no.

## Never?
Never.

## Speak English?... Habla Ingles?
Si.

## What about the water?
When it comes.

## When it comes? What'd you tell him?
Comes in different parts of the river. Every night a different part.

## Jake, what're you doin' here?
Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour, I thought I'd drop by and see who died lately.

## So how are you, Morty?
Yeah.

## Come again?
Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed.

## Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that?
It's bone dry, Morty.

## PHONE Gittes?... Gittes?
Yeah.

## Yeah?... I do?
PHONE Sure you do.

## How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?
Mr. Gittes...

## No, really?
I'm afraid so.

## Can't we talk about this alone, Mr. Gittes?
I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.

## Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your husband?
...Yes of course.

## All right, what's your husband's first name?
Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.

## Water and Power?
This type of investigation can be hard on your pocketbook, Mrs. Mulwray. It takes time.

## Yeah. Do you have any references?
City of La Habra Heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.

## Never heard of 'em... new owners?
Yeah.

## He's not in, Mr.?
Gittes.

## It's personal. Has he been out long?
Since lunch.

## Fifteen minutes ago. Why don't I go in and wait?
Mr. Yelburton will be busy for some time.

## Julian Cross worked for the water department?
Yes. No.

## He did or he didn't?
He owned it.

## He owned the water department?
Yes.

## He owned the entire water supply for the city?
Yes.

## How did they get it away from him?
Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the display. The water. If you'll just read the display.

## This?
They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.

## What about?
I don't know. The traffic was pretty loud. I only heard one thing  apple core.

## Apple core?
Yeah.

## Jesus Christ, Walsh. That's what you spent your day doing?
Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.

## So he says you sent them?
They're all a bunch of phonies.

## Yeah?
Sue people like that they're liable to be having dinner with the Judge who's trying the suit.

## What's that, pal?
Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.

## Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
Mortgage Department, First National Bank.

## Tell me, how many people a week do you foreclose on?
We don't publish a record in the paper, I can tell you that.

## I'm going to see a man called Julian Cross. Ever heard of him?
Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you, mister?... I ask because he doesn't see a whole lot of people.

## She ran away?
Oh yeah, it was a big thing at the time. Julian Cross' daughter. God almighty. She was a wild little thing.

## Well, you never know, do you?
That's for sure.

## Why'd she run away?
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.

## We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
She ran off to Mexico. Rumor was she was knocked up and didn't even know who the father was. Went there to get rid of it.

## You don't say?
Cross was looking for her all over the country. Offered rewards, everything. Felt real sorry for him, with all his money.

## What are you doing here?
I bought a ticket. I've come to see the film.

## Alfredo, did you know my father?
Of course I knew your father. He was tall, thin, pleasant, and had a moustache like mine. Always smiling. He looked like Clark Gable.

## Will they really find work in Germany?
Come in, Alfredo.

## How's school?
OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...

## Why? What do you mean?
That's right, Modern Times.

## Now what can you see?
Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.

## Toto, are you pulling my leg or something? How is it possible to see this television without film?
Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any. And if you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any fuss...

## You weren't expecting me?
No, nobody came.

## Did you ever see her again?
No. And nobody knows where she is.

## Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh?
Thanks for all you've done for me.

## Good morning, father. It's hard on the feet, huh?
What is it, Alfredo? Right now, of all times!

## You understand now? You see it clearly?
Yes, nice day. ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.

## For what?
You have a great future as a driver. If they don't arrest you first!!

## So what'd they say?
No, Salvatore. You'd better go. It's my father.

## Who?
You're still beautiful...

## Alfredo died. Do you remember him?
Of course I remember him. I'm sorry. You were terribly fond of him.

## No. And I'm not married. Are you happy?
All things considered, yes. Even if it wasn't what I dreamt of then...

## Sure, sure! Boccia... What's he do?
It's the first time I've had to chance to tell the story. I never mentioned it to anybody.

## I don't remember him any moreMa, where's Russia?
It takes years to get there. And years to come back...Now go to bed, Toto, it's late.

## I've been looking for you all day. Did you buy the milk?
No...

## Then where's the money?
OK...

## How long's it been shut?
That's fine, Mr. Kane.

## Hey, Brad! Brad! He ain't been drinking before, Mr. Kane. Never. We would have heard.
Where is he?

## What does it say there?
Thais.

## Ready for dinner, Brad?
It's a saying, Mr. Bernstein. A new broom sweeps clean.

## You don't really think so?
Please, Mr. Bernstein.

## Well, the way I look at it - - You want to know what I really think would be wonderful?
That's a long story.

## And the social. How about the music notice? You got that in?
Oh, yes, it's already made up. Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.

## Enthusiastic?
Yes, very! Naturally.

## I'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. I'm calling on you.
Well, well - isn't that nice?

## I'm going back there.
Who else you been to see?

## Who said anything about brooms?
We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes.

## Do you, Mr. Leland?
Certainly not.

## What's the matter?
Sure. They're like anybody else. They got work to do. They do it. Only they happen to be the best men in the business.

## Do we stand for the same things that the \"Chronicle\" stands for, Mr. Bernstein?
Certainly not. So what's that got to do with it? Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.

## Do you, Mr. Leland?
Certainly not.

## Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite? Am I a New England school-marm?
Well, he'll be coming back in September. The Majestic. I got the reservations. It gets in on the ninth.

## What's happened?
If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows.

## Not to me. But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
Yes, Mr. Bernstein.

## Kane? Charlie? Where is he?
I suppose he's fixing it up - I know I'd never get that through.

## Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein. Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
How do you do, Mr. Leland?

## That's one of the things I think must be changed, Mr. Carter. The news goes on for twenty-four hours a day.
How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?

## Was the show covered by every department?
Exactly according to your instructions, Mr. Kane. We've got two spreads of pictures.

## And the notice?
Yes - Mr. Kane.

## Is it good?
Yes, Mr. kane.

## It isn't finished?
No, Mr. Kane.

## That's Leland, isn't it?
Yes, Mr. Kane.

## Has he said when he'll finish?
We haven't heard from him.

## He used to work fast - didn't he, Mr. Bernstein?
The nurse has complete instructions, but if you care to talk to me at any time, I should be only too glad - I shall be here in the morning.

## There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?
The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane.

## I don't think so. Are you coming, Charles?
You are. You look like you've been making mud pies.

## I'm sorry. They live here, too?
No. They've passed on.

## Where's the soap?
In the water.

## Where's the towel?
On the chiffonier. Here.

## A chicken?
No. But you're close.

## A rooster?
I didn't run into you and I bet they're not your Sunday clothes. You've probably got a lot of clothes.

## How old did you say you were?
I didn't say.

## I didn't think you did. If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old?
Pretty old. I'll be twenty-two in August.

## That's a ripe old age - What do you do?
I work at Seligman's.

## Is that what you want to do?
I want to be a singer. I mean, I didn't. Mother did for me.

## What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
Yes -

## Would you sing for me?
Half past eleven.

## At night?
Yes. The bulldog's just gone to press.

## Can't we go back, Charlie?
It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting Venuses.

## Is that really your idea of how to run a newspaper?
I don't know how to run a newspaper, Mr. Thatcher. I just try everything I can think of.

## I came to see you, Charles, about your - about the Enquirer's campaign against the Metropolitan Transfer Company.
Can you prove it isn't?

## Charles, my time is too valuable for me -
Can't say, sir.

## Do you know what that is?
It's a wall you bought in China, Mr. Kane.

## He was dead... That's a poem. Do you know what it means?
It's been a tough day.

## It's a good idea for a newspaper. Four hundred sixy thousand.
What're you going to do, Charlie?

## Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?
Say, Brad. I've got an idea.

## Yes?
I mean I've got a job for you.

## You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
I'd like that.

## Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?
Why not? Well - nobody's a great man in your estimation until he's dead.

## What do you mean by that?
Yesterday morning you called the President a traitor. What do you think that crowd is doing down there? They think you murdered him.

## Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the \"Enquirer\" in his pocket?
and that copy of the \"Enquirer\" said the President should be killed.

## What's wrong, Brad?
Charlie, it's just no go. We can't agree anymore. I wish you'd let me go to Chicago.

## Why, Brad?
She hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you.

## There's no reason why this - this savage personal note -
Do you think the \"Enquirer\" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?

## Hey, Brad! I've been analyzed an awful lot tonight - let's have another brandy.
Are you finished?

## You still want to be transferred to the other paper?
Yes.

## We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else?
Mr. Leland sent back that check.

## What check?
You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.

## That's what you think, is it, Jim?
Yes.

## On your way out, stop at a cigar store, will you, and send me up a couple of cigars?
Sure, Mr. Leland. I'll be glad to.

## Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?
Right here, Mrs. Kane.

## How do you do, Charles?
Yeah, all in crates.

## I wonder how they put all those pieces together?
Anything and everything - he was a regular crow.

## Kane's last words, aren't they, Jerry? That was Jerry's angle, wasn't it, Jerry? Did you ever find out what it means, Jerry?
Yes, and maybe he didn't.

## That's the whole works, right up to date.
Queer?

## Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
Millions - if anybody wants it.

## The banks are out of luck, eh?
Oh, I don't know. They'll clear all right.

## How do you want to handle the whole thing - ask questions?
I'd rather you just talked. Anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and Mr. Kane.

## How did you meet him?
I didn't get a thing. Just the music lessons. That's all there was to it.

## What about that apartment?
In case you've never heard of how I lost all my money - and it was plenty, believe me -

## Right away. Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?
She'll snap out of it. Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as about anybody. Sooner.

## What the hell is that?
That's your lung. By this time, your lung looks like this.

## What's this?
Unnhh!

## This? How long have you been smoking?
Thanks. Have a good one.

## Do you mind if I drink this here?
Sure. Go ahead.

## How long have you been a smoker?
Excuse me, but...

## This is where you're heading. A cruddy lung, smoking through a hole in your throat. Do you really want that?
Fifty-five.

## Children's programming. What did your mom say when you told her you weren't engaged anymore?
She said not to come home until graduation.

## Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?
What can I say? He does weird things to me.

## Can I watch?
You can hold me down.

## Can I join in?
You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.

## Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?
A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.

## Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?
Dick.

## So where is he?
He went home to change for the big date.

## God, isn't he great?
No, this is great.

## Can I use the bathroom?
There's no light back there.

## Why aren't there any lights?
Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night.

## Am I missing something here?
I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.

## He was?
You dog! I didn't see you go back there.

## When did you get back?
Just now.

## Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?
Train. It took eight hours.

## You're just going to lock the store like that?
I want to talk to you about something, and I don't want to be disturbed.

## You saw it?
Very dramatic, I thought.

## What, it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child?
I'm not pregnant.

## Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up.

## Well... kind of, sort of?
I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby.

## How do you know that?
Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.

## So you're really getting married?
No.

## No, you're not really getting married?
How like her.

## Was I right?
Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.

## And you came here to what? To comfort me?
The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.

## Sang? His name is a past tense?
Stop it. He's a nice guy.

## If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him?
I just told you.

## Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
Tell me I don't have something to do with it.

## If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?
Jesus, you're caustic.

## But can we date?
I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.

## So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.

## You mean, on a date?
Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.

## How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date?
I hear that's a rather popular date.

## What about Sing?
Sang.

## So what are you saying?
You're such an asshole.

## What happened to the walk and the nakedness?
I'm easy, but I'm not that easy. See you later, handsome.

## How'd you get here so fast?
I left like an hour ago.

## Do you always talk weird after you violate women?
Promise me it'll always be like that.

## Like what?
When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.

## Was it you?
I'm serious.

## We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?
No.

## Wait a second? Who was working here today?
Just me.

## Then who operated the store?
Nobody. It was closed.

## With this guy locked in?
Everything happened at once. I guess I forgot he was back there.

## Shock trauma. She's going to need years of therapy after this. My question is, How did she come to have sex with the dead man?
She thought it was me.

## Are you open?
Yeah.

## Excuse me?
Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired.

## Are you open?
Yes.

## To the back, above the oil. How long are you staying?
Pack of cigarettes. Congratulations. I saw that announcement in today's paper. She's marrying an Asian design major.

## Awww, he's so cute. What's his name?
Lenin's Tomb.

## Pack of cigarettes. Cute cat. What's its name?
Annoying Customer.

## So I'm no more responsible for my own decisions while I'm here at work than, say, the Death Squad soldiers in Bosnia?
Cute cat. What's his name.

## You open?
Yeah.

## What do you care? Hey, what smells like shoe polish?
I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.

## Why are the shutters closed?
Someone jammed gum in the locks.

## What time do you have to stay till?
He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.

## What smells like shoe polish?
Go open the sore.

## I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since I rule. Is the Pelican flying?
Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.

## Why?
I wanted to use your car.

## You called Caitlin again?
She called me.

## Did you tell Veronica?
One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.

## What do you two fight about?
I guess it's not really fighting. She just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction.

## I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend, let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?
Seven months.

## Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin?
Five years.

## Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?
Eight and a half.

## Eight and a half?
Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.

## That's cheating?
In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.

## She called you Brad?
She called me Brad.

## What do you mean?
She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.

## Great story, isn't it?
That girl was vile to you.

## Interesting postscript to that story, Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom?
Your mother.

## You think things would be any different now?
Oh shit, I've got to place an order.

## No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...?
...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.

## Caitlin's on the same wave-length?
I think it's safe to say yes.

## All four?
Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.

## What's that?
All right, Vader's boss...

## How do you mean?
Well, he's like the pope for the dark side of the Force. He's a holy man; a shaman, kind of, albeit an evil one.

## So they build another Death Star, right?
Yeah.

## And you figured it out?
Basically.

## And the second time around...?
The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction.

## So?
Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at.

## All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction?
You'll never believe what this unruly customer just said...

## She's in here?
This guy is going through all of the eggs. Look.

## What's he looking for?
He said he has to find a perfect dozen.

## The quest isn't going well?
Obviously not. Look at all the cartons that didn't make the grade.

## Why doesn't he just mix and match?
I told him that and he yelled at me.

## What did he say?
He said it was important to have standards. He said nobody has pride anymore.

## What's a jizz-mopper?
He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off.

## Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
I guess not.

## Can we talk about this later?
Why do you do things like that? You know she's going to come back and tell the boss.

## How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?
It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.

## The milkmaids?
You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.

## Which ones?
All of them.

## Why not?
Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married.

## Smokey Three, thumbs up, am I right?
The best Burtless movie ever made.

## What?
I heard you apologize. Why? You have every right in the world to be mad.

## The fact that I'm right about your buckling?
I'm going to miss the game.

## Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street?
We're not playing in the street.

## Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink?
Gatorade.

## What happened to all the Gatorade?
I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married.

## How? When?
Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.

## Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?
Number six.

## Why not?
It's today.

## What!?
Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four.

## Shit. What about tomorrow?
One night only. She's buried in the morning.

## You hate people.
Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?

## But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.

## You were saying?
Thanks for putting me in a tough spot. You're a good friend.

## She was pretty young, hunhh?
Twenty-two; same as us.

## How'd he die?
Broke his neck.

## That's embarrassing?
He broke his neck trying to suck his own dick.

## Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
Come on. Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?

## Who found him?
My cousin? My aunt found him. On his bed, doubled over himself with his legs on top. Dick in his mouth. My aunt freaked out. It was a mess.

## His dick was in his mouth?
Balls resting on his lips.

## He made it, hunhh?
Yeah, but at what a price.

## Reach what?
You know.

## What, your dick?
Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.

## Fine. Just lend me your car.
Nobody's there. It's four o'clock on a Saturday. How many people ever come to the store at four on a Saturday?

## Why should I loan you my car?
I want to rent a movie.

## Can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers at least some of the time?
Let me borrow your car.

## May I be blunt with you?
If you must.

## The reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description, and I'm supposed to follow it, right?
Exactly.

## What the fuck did you do that for?
Two reasons, one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.

## What?
You're a danger to both the dead and the living.

## What'd you rent? Best of Both Worlds?
Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box, Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.

## And this is what you rented?
I like to expand my horizons.

## Holy shit. That girl?
As opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here.

## Then how come you got the fine?
Because I'm here.

## Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
Because I'm happy.

## You're happy?
I'm happy.

## You're happy to get a fine?
No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.

## What did she say?
She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.

## I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
Watch the store while I go home and change.

## What happened to title dictates behavior?
This is my way of spitting water at life.

## Hey, what about Veronica?
You're a snake.

## You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight.

## Who eats cock?
Bunch of savages in this town. Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time.

## Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium?
Could be.

## She said she did all the work.
You just fucked a total stranger?

## WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP? WHO THE FUCK IS IN THE BATHROOM?
Around three or something.

## What time did we go to the funeral?
I think four.

## What? What's with you? You haven't said anything for like twenty minutes. What the hell is your problem?
This life.

## Why do I have this life?
Have some chips; you'll feel better.

## That's all bullshit. You know what the real problem here is?
I was born.

## What are you talking about?
I'm talking about this thing you have... this inability to improve your situation in life.

## What responsibility?
All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit.

## Oh, like your life's any better?
I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day.

## Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
It's the same thing with Veronica.

## Am I right or what?
My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants.

## The swelling's not so bad. But the FDS stings. How's your neck?
It's hard to swallow.

## Why the fuck did you tell Veronica that I was going to dump her for Caitlin?
I thought I was doing you a favor.

## Why do you say that?
Why do I say that? Randal... forget it.

## No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
What don't you do? Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.

## What time did you get to work today?
I threw out the stuff that got broken. The floor looks clean.

## You need a ride?
Got one. Just pulled up.

## Same time. What about you?
I'm calling out. Going to hit the hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then try to see Veronica.

## You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here?
I'll call you. Let you know.

## Are you open?
Yes.

## Do I know you?
You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...

## Caitlin Bree. Yeah?
I'm her sister.

## You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
Yep. I remember you got caught in my parents' room with Caitlin once.

## You know him?
Caitlin used to talk about him all the time.

## THE GLADES MOTEL?
I'm surprised you never found out about it, Dante. Everybody in school knew-even in my class.

## Jesus Christ, what next?
Sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym.

## Excuse me?
I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds.

## How much can you bench?
I don't know.

## Did you say Caitlin Bree?
Yeah.

## Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?
No, she's getting married.

## What?
While you two were dating in high school. We're talking four, five years ago, back when I drove a Trans- Am.

## Wait a second! You used to sleep with Caitlin Bree? While I was dating her?
All the time. That girl was like a rabbit.

## What? When? When did all this shit happen?
One seventy-nine.

## Pay the good man. Don't you close soon?
A half hour.

## We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out. You get high?
It's not my store.

## What's that mean?
You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.

## All right. How much is Pepsi here?
A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.

## Hey, man, what happened with that old guy?
He died in the bathroom.

## You used to go out with her?
We were going to start again, I think.

## Don't you already have a girlfriend?
Veronica.

## And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick?
Maybe.

## You calling me a liar?
No; he was probably just resting his eyes.

## And he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass...?
No, he got hit by a bus.

## Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?
Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.

## Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there?
The white kind.

## I'm not asking about the color. I mean is it rough or cottony?
Actually, it is kind of rough.

## Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?
I said go ahead.

## The porno mags?
Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties.

## The guy got sick and couldn't come in.
All right, stupid question. But don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard?

## Why did you agree to come in then?
I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in.

## Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here?
Somebody jammed the locks with gum.

## You look bushed. What time did you get to bed?
I don't know-like two-thirty, three.

## What were you doing up so late?
Hunhh? Nothing.

## Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
Who's defensive? Just... Would you just hug me?! All right? Your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged.

## How much money did you leave up there?
Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.

## How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?
Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.

## Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish?
I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off.

## Really?
I was kidding.

## You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you?
Women? Women, as lovers, are all basically the same, they just have to be there.

## Oh, you think so?
A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.

## Something wrong?
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just \"being there\"-as you put it-is not enough.

## Including you?
It better be up to and including me.

## You've slept with twelve different girls?
Including you; yes.

## What the hell was that for?
You're a pig.

## Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
Three.

## Three?
Three including you.

## You've only had sex with three different people?
I'm not the pig you are.

## No; who were the three, besides me?
John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.

## Where?
To school. There's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment.

## Can't we ever have a discussion without that coming up?
It's important to me, Dante. You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit. I wish you'd go back to school.

## Shit! Why are we getting up?
Unlike you, I have a class in forty- five minutes.

## Why do you call him that?
Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.

## What do you mean?
After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing.

## He requested this?
He gets off on it.

## Why do you say that?
Like you said-she snowballed him.

## You sucked that guy's dick?
Yeah. How do you think I know he liked...

## Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?
Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.

## How many?
Dante...

## HOW MANY?
Something like thirty-six.

## What the hell is that anyway, \"something like thirty-six?\" Does that include me?
Um. Thirty-seven.

## I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?
I'm going to class.

## Goodbye, Dante.
A few?

## He still hasn't shown up. Why aren't you in class?
Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.

## What is it?
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne.

## What did he say?
At least he wasn't thirty-six.

## And that made you feel better?
And he said most of them are college guys, I've never met or seen.

## You couldn't get these shutters open?
I called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow.

## Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee?
Sure.

## Would you let me explain...
What the fuck did you do that for?

## Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?
Veronica... I... it's not like that anymore... I mean, it was never really like that...

## Randal...?
And having him tell me... that was just the weakest move ever. You're spineless.

## You open?
Yes. I'm not out of shape.

## Dante Hicks. Why? What is this about?
Here you go.

## What's this?
A fine, for five hundred dollars.

## What are you talking about?
I didn't do that!

## Scumbag. What are you doing?
Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin.

## He's your cousin?
Check this out, he's from Russia.

## He only speaks Russian?
I don't know, man. He's a fucking character.

## Is he staying here?
He's moving to the big city next week. He wants to be a metal singer.

## He really wants to play metal?
English. Come on, \"Berserker!\" Girls think sexy.

## Let me ask you a question, Do you think this guy's out of shape?
I don't know. I can't really tell from here.

## Really?
Oh yeah. You were the built older guy with the black Trans and the big...

## Sure. How about the beach?
I like the way you think.

## You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie?
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.

## Well, how about these two movies?
I just held up the same two movies. You're not even paying attention.

## I hope it feels so good to be right. There is nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?
Well this is the last time I ever rent here...

## How long you gonna be here?
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.

## You're gonna be at John K's party?
My man is deaf. I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY! Neh.

## Yo, don't sell all that. Cause I'm gonna get the cash and buy it from you at John K's. You're gonna bring it, right?
The only place I don't bring my drugs is church. And that ain't till Sunday morning.

## Yo. I'll see you at that party. I'll see you there?
I'll see you there.

## And... he told you all of this?
Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.

## Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
I'm going to have a word with that asshole.

## Which one?
Dental School.

## Says who?
Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.

## Twenty bucks?
No, I'm just visiting my man. Dante, this is Willam Black. This is Dante Hicks, my boyfriend.

## Do you still talk to Sylvan?
I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends.

## That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right?
No way, death-breath, that was too intense for thunder. C'mon let's rock an' roll.

## What?
That woulda been cool.

## C-4?
More bang for the buck.

## I admit, I can be bought.
Who's shooting?

## Jessie, Jessie, copy?
I copy.

## Where's the radio?
Hey, Jessie, you're just in time for another masterpiece.

## So, what do you see?
Surprise me.

## A monkey?
So...what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.

## That was the first and last question-- now only answers. Where's the chopper?
It can't fly in this weather.

## Bags?
Suits, underwear, 100 million dollars...the usual stuff. Travers was smart enough to bring along a tracking device. Step into my office.

## Tucker?
Qualen, glad you stuck around. There should be a few hundred cops looking to meet you.

## I want the money--meet me at the highest point from where you are. Don't do it and we're going to see if your angel here can fly. Copy?
Copy. Jessie, go to the top of Bitker ladder.

## Glad you could drop in.
Love's a killer, isn't it?

## Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
I think it's out. No big deal. It's that old football injury.

## You're gone now! I don't climb with people I can't trust. Why'd you come up, to prove something?
I'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it.

## We'll never know, will we?
Look, it was a bad time for everybody.

## Would you?
Thanks for staying around when you didn't have to.

## How's your leg? I'll live. Where'd you leave Jessie?
Give him the money.

## How're ya feeling?
Fine, I guess...

## Sarah, tonight why don't you and Hal come over for dinner?
Okay--I don't know about this.

## Please, can I think about this for a minute...Okay, I'm sorry, it's fine. What do you want me to do?
Just keep lookin' at me and only think about the distance across. Count it as you go, One, two...by eight you'll be there.

## Can I count as fast as I like?
Patience my love, patience.

## Gabe? Gabe, where are you?
Just hangin' out.

## On my way. Alright Sarah, are you ready for the best ride in the park?
Hello, Gabriel.

## Where've you been?
Working...I'm trying to figure out where to start.

## Why can't you believe that you did everything you could?
Did I? I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line. Maybe I panicked.

## I don't understand?
You couldn't.

## Resuscitation?
--mouth-to-mouth, which could maybe...

## Which could maybe what?
Maybe lead to a flare up...

## Listen to you... The old \"mouth-to-mouth\" resuscitation routine, huh?
From one professional to another, of course.

## Where?
It doesn't matter, anywhere but here.

## What if he can't?
I haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel.

## Can't do it? I don't believe this. Don't you feel anything?
I only came back for you.

## What are you doing here!?
Looking for Hal. Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open...you came back.

## Where's Hal, what's going on?
For the same reason you did, to help.

## They've got to find shelter soon, and so do we. How are you holding up?
You know me, I'm a night person.

## What about you?
Don't worry about me, just go.

## I'm glad you find humor in this. Do you know what people would do for that?
I can't believe you just said that.

## Neither can I. What do you think they're doing now?
Making things real rough for Hal.

## Remember the first time we came up here?
Of course I do.

## Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
Only kidding...actually I attacked you.

## If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
Sure, just give it back when you're done.

## We have to get through to the other side. You up for it?
I've gone this far, and right now I think I'm in better shape than you.

## Want me to lead?
Cute.

## Nice view, huh?
Breathtaking.

## What was God thinking when he built this place?
If we don't get out of here soon we can ask him in person.

## Gabe! Are you alright?
No, not really. Throw down a rope.

## Can you see light?
Up ahead.

## Gabe are you alright?
For the record, whenever you hear me sliding out of control, I'm never alright. When I secure the line, come on up.

## No luck?
Start pulling it apart! We're climbing down on it.

## I'm holding you to that. Gabe, what about Frank?
I don't know. I don't know.

## What about you?
Take the rope.

## Look here, the mountain man. You're Walker, right?
Good memory. You must be great with numbers.

## What the fuck you mean you burned it?
Never could save a thing.

## What the hell's going on?
The faster you find the bags, the bigger you boys' finder's fee will be.

## What's he doing?
The best he can since you gave him nothing.

## Souvenirs? No, wrong answer. Looks like your friend plans on hanging around, that possible?
No, he's gone.

## How far?
Yeah...

## What's your names?
Tucker and Walker.

## He asked you, how far?! I think you've been taking the scenic route. How far from here?
Copy. Hal, tell Gabe he only makes advances to me or else he'll be walking down four thousand feet, and sleeping outside.

## Who's going with you?
You're looking at him.

## Where's the rest of the team?
Bob and Rick are in Denver. I gotta get up there as fast as possible. Frank, get me a load of flares.

## On my way. The cases are hooked up and ready.
Do you always transport through the air?

## Why didn't you send the money over?
Somehow I didn't think you'd wait for me if I'd sent it first.

## Ask the questions.
What's the delay?

## Man against nature, right Travers.
You're both with the mountain rescue team?

## Down there you buy a life, up here you earn it or die. How's your health?
This way.

## We're down to a few hours before the whole world shows up here. Where's the next one?
Good, Travers. It might catch on, like shooting skeet.

## Is it set?
Primed to go off right over his head, officer.

## What's the code, Travers?
No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.

## You're the boss. Let's head out to the tarmac. Matheson, have you been totally briefed?
Mostly. Armored cars can be hijacked. Trains can be derailed. But nobody can get to us in flight.

## What did you do that for?
For being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother.

## Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, if it isn't little Alex. Long time no viddy, droog. How goes? Surprised are you?
Impossible... I don't believe it.

## Been punished, yeah?
I've been cured.

## Of course. Food alright?
Great, sir. Great.

## Won't you join me, sir?
No, my health doesn't allow it.

## ... used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing.
And you, sir?

## And now you, another victim of the modern age. But you can be helped. I phoned some friends while you were having a bath.
Your wife, sir? Has she gone away?

## Phoned some friends, sir?
Yes. They want to help.

## Help me, sir?
Help you.

## No, no my boy. No trouble at all. Alex slowly sits.
Who are they, sir?

## Excuse me, missus, can you please help? There's been a terrible accident. Can I please use your telephone for an ambulance?
I'm frightfully sorry. There is a telephone in the Public House about a mile down the road. I suggest you use that.

## Our brief govereet thru the letter hole was not, shall we say, satisfactory, yes?
Naughty, naughty, naughty, you filthy old soomaka.

## No! No! Don't touch it. That's a very important work of art. What the bloody hell do you want?
You see, madam, I am part of an international student's contest to see who can get the most points for selling magazines.

## How do you do, sir?
Hullo.

## Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
Much better, thank you, sir.

## Feel like talking to us. Answering a few questions?
Fine, sir, fine.

## Well, shall we get down to it?
Yes, sir. Rubinstein takes out a notebook.

## Why didn't you let us know what was happening, son?
Sorry, Em, I wanted it to be like... a big surprise for you and pee.

## A cup of the old chai, sir?
No time, no time, yes. Sit, sit, sit. Alex sits next to him.

## So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence?
Oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, Missus. It's just the 9th.

## You mean Beethoven's 9th Symphony?
That's right. Er... I can't listen to the 9th any more at all. When I hear the 9th, I get like this funny feeling.

## When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you?
That is correct, sir. And then all I can think about is like trying to snuff it.

## I beg your pardon?
Snuff it, sir... um... death, I mean, missus... Er... I just want to die peacefully like with no... pain.

## Do you feel that way now?
Um... oh no, sir, not exactly, I still feel very miserable, very much down in spirits.

## Well done, Frank. Julian, get the car, will you please?
Appy polly loggies. I had something of a pain in the gulliver so had to sleep. I was not awakened when I gave orders for awakening.

## Who said that?
I did, sir.

## Not feeling too bad now are you?
No, sir, I feel really great.

## Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?
Good evening, my boy.

## Certainly, sir. What do they call you at home?
As an unmuddied lake, Fred. As clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, Fred.

## Surprise?
One I think you will like... as a, how shall I put it, as a symbol of our new understanding. An understanding between two friends.

## Keeping fit then?
Fine, fine.

## Well, how are you then?
Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know.

## Well, still the same old place then, eh?
Oh, aye, aye.

## No thanks, Mum. It'll pass in a minute... ... What have you done with all my own personal things?
Well. That was all took away, son, by the Police. New regulation about compensation for the victim.

## What about Basil? Where's my snake?
Oh well, he met with like an accident. He passed away. Alex becomes a bit weepy.

## What do I want?
Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.

## You're gonna be sick are you?
I wanna be sick.

## You wanna be sick?
Let me get up.

## You are now in H.M. Prison Parkmoor and from this moment you will address all prison officers as sir! Name?
Alexander de Large, sir.

## Crime?
Murder, sir.

## Now then, were you in Police custody this morning?
No, sir.

## Religion?
C of E, sir.

## Do you mean Church of England?
Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.

## Brown hair, is it?
Fair hair, sir.

## Blue eyes?
Blue eyes, yes, sir.

## Do you wear eye glasses or contact lenses?
No, sir.

## Have you ever had any mental illness?
No, sir.

## Do you wear any false teeth or false limbs?
No, sir.

## Are you an Epileptic?
No, sir.

## Crabs?
No, sir.

## Lice?
No, sir.

## Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn't it?
Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.

## How're you feeling this morning?
Fine... fine.

## What's the hypo for then? Going to send me to sleep?
Oh no, nothing of the sort.

## What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?
It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films.

## You mean like going to the pictures?
Something like that.

## You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
I imagine you'll be feeling a little bit limp by the end of the day. But we have to be hard on you. You have to be cured.

## How are you feeling today?
Fine. Fine.

## Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
Just part of hospital routine.

## No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?
Ohhh... jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.

## Yes?
Patients who've sustained the kind of injuries you have often have dreams of this sort. It's all part of the recovery process.

## I just say what the other person would say?
Yes. Yes, well don't think about it too long, just say the first thing that pops into your mind.

## Good. What do you want?
Excuse me, missus. No time for the old in-out, I've just come to read the meter. Slide of bird's nest with eggs.

## I hope so. Is that the end then?
It's not that kind of a test. But you seem well on the way to a complete recovery.

## And when do I get out of here then?
I'm sure it won't be long now.

## What's all this about sin?
That!... Using Ludwig van like that! He did no harm to anyone. Beethoven just wrote music.

## Oh-hhh!!! Go on, do me in you bastard cowards. I don't want to live anyway, not in a stinking world like this.
You're keen on music?

## Oh - and what's so stinking about it?
Oh, thankyou, your honour. The Tramp takes a second look at Alex.

## Father, I have tried, have I not?
You have, my son.

## I've done my best, have I not?
Indeed.

## And, Father, I've never been guilty of any institutional infractions, have I?
You certainly have not, 655321. You've been very helpful, and you've shown a genuine desire to reform.

## I take it you are referring to the Ludovico Technique?
I don't know what it's called, Father, all I know is that it gets you out quickly and makes sure that you never get in again.

## But it is being used, isn't it, Father?
I don't care about the danger, Father. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.

## Prison custody?
One shirt - blue, collar attached.

## Have you been receiving medical treatment for any serious illness?
One pair of trousers - blue pinstriped.

## Have you ever had any attacks of fainting or dizziness?
One pair of underpants - white with blue waistband.

## Are you now, or ever have been, a homosexual?
Mothballs, sir.

## Leave to carry on, sir, please?
No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers.

## Well, what's the matter lad, are you feeling alright?
Dad... It's the treatment. More retching.

## How many to a cell?
Four in this block, sir.

## Shall we go to my office?
Thank you.

## Hi ya' doin'? Where to?
Park Avenue and East 2nd. Take Centre to Canal, up the Bowery, Cooper and Third, left on 41st, come around on Park.

## What?
Sixth is faster.

## We taking bets? What if you're wrong?
The ride is free.

## You like Bach?
I used to play this piece back in high school.

## Let me guess. Clarinet?
Violin. I never had the lungs for wind instruments.

## No? How many cabbies get you into an argument to save you money?
There were two of us. I had the other guy killed. Don't need the competition...

## You're an anomaly in today's world, Max. You're good at what you do, so you must take pride in it...?
This? Temporary. To pay the bills and save. I got plans...

## Like what?
Travel...and things.

## You psychic?
Bottega.

## Big case?
Yeah.

## You never answered my question. You like what you do?
Most of the time.

## But not now?
Like you, I'm good at it. But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.

## When was the last time you took one?
Soon. But I take little ones all the time. Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean.

## How often you go?
Dozen times a day.

## Max, I'm scared. Are you sure?
Yes! Stay put, goddamn it! Don't move from that spot...

## This your current address?
Yes.

## You still carrying passengers?
I was heading back to my garage. It's on the way.

## You dizzy? You want to sit down?
I'm...fine. Fine.

## You heard Armstrong play live. I've never been this jealous. You get to talk to him?
Did better'n that.

## Get outta here! You and Louis?
Unbelievable... ...you hearing this? Unbelievable.

## Remember what you played?
The crowd had to dig it.

## You know Dmitri?
Fraid so.

## I never lie. Ask Max. Max, have I lied yet?
One more thing. If by some chance I get this wrong...tell Dmitri I'm sorry.

## It's simple. What was your pal Louis' first musical instrument?
I know the answer. I know all there is to know about Louis.

## Tell me, Vincent. Do you believe in Santa Claus?
Can't say that I do.

## What?
I think... ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.

## What? What did you say?
I said. Get the gun. Out. Of my fucking face. Before I wrap it in a blintz and feed it to you.

## You tell me. I had to toss the list in the river. I was protecting your sorry, long-winded ass. So why don't you show a little courtesy?
You think I wanted to come here tonight? You think I'm that stupid? Sometimes shit happens, you gotta roll with it.

## Tell me. Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children?
The fat man on Cherry Street. The other fat man, Mr. Bulldozer. The trumpet player. That leaves two.

## Can you finish on schedule?
In fifteen years, I have never left a customer unsatisfied.

## Twenty five?
Hell, make it fifty. Same goes for any business we have in the future.

## Something going on?
Pretty quiet down there. A cab just pulled up, aside from that...

## Can you fax me his picture? His license or something? What do you mean you don't have that there? Anybody else in the cab?
...got off the phone with his dispatcher. What an asshole. Cabbie's name is Max Rilke, been driving that cab for ten years...

## So?
No. Your cabbie is floating down a storm drain or stuffed in the trunk of a cab.

## What are you gonna do?
Take him down. Save Richard Yip, our witness...

## ...this snitch of yours, what's his name, Ivan?
Ivan Petrov. Supposed to meet me for dinner, never shows up. I come here, find this.

## You guys been holding hands?
Months now. He's been feeding me information on Dmitri.

## What thing?
Cabbie drove around all night. Three people got killed.

## Oh, right. The guy flipped out or something? Killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?
They found him dead in his own cab down by the Port Authority.

## Oh?
...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue. The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker.

## Elvis?
Joey Cicerno. Dear friend and associate of my missing snitch, Ivan Petrov. Both of whom were in bed with Dmitri.

## Jesus. Two in one night?
Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there.

## What if they're wrong?
No harm done, ma'am.

## Oh, call me Ida. To what do we owe the pleasure?
I was with Max when he got the call.

## And you came all the way down here to see me?
It's nothing.

## What's your name?
Vincent...

## I brought you flowers.
Try?

## What am I gonna do with flowers?
You're gonna cheer up.

## By worrying about you spending money on foolish things? So I can watch them wilt?
He paid for 'em.

## You paid for my flowers? They're beautiful. Max, you gonna introduce us?
Mom, Vincent. Vincent, my mother, Ida Rilke.

## What's he sayin'?
I'm standing right here.

## Yo, whassup?
Vincent Farrell, Assistant U.S. Attorney. A passenger in this taxicab, and I'm reporting you to the DMV...

## How am I supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick?
I was just tryin' to...to...

## Who is this?
Same fare you talked to last time. The U.S. Attorney...

## We're gay lovers, what's it to you?
Nothin'! Aside from Max's mother driving me crazy, I'm dancin' on a rainbow! Get him on the line, please.

## Yeah? So?
Where you been the last two hours? Your mother's been calling every ten minutes whining about how you didn't show up.

## Hello?
Oh. Sorry.

## Uh, let's go to... Hello...?
Yeah, yeah, sorry...

## How long you think this'll take?
Twenty-four minutes.

## Mind if I time you? What do I get if you're wrong? A free ride?
An apology.

## First time in New York?
It's home.

## You know, this is the cleanest cab I've ever been in. This your regular ride?
Yeah. I share it with the dayshift guy.

## You prefer nights?
People are more relaxed. Less stress, less traffic, better tips.

## Yeah. Retirement? Paid sick leave?
It's not that kind of job.

## Why not?
Last thing I need is a reason to keep hacking. This job's a fill-in.

## Oh? How long you been doing this?
Twelve years. But I'm working on other stuff...

## Like what?
I don't talk about it, you know... No offense.

## Regulations? These guys don't even give you sick leave. How much you pull down on a good night?
Two, two-fifty.

## We have a deal. What's your name?
Max.

## You always stutter?
Yeah, yeah. Shit, man. Guy fell on my motherfucking cab.

## You - you killed him?
No-no, I-I shot him. The bullets and the fall killed him.

## With what?
You were going to drive me around. Drop me at LAX. Never be the wiser. But El Gordo missed the elevator. So we go to Plan B. Pop the trunk.

## The trunk?
Did I stutter? The trunk. Unless you want him riding up front with you...but given hygiene and his sphincters have let go...

## Got it?
Yeah.

## It's not me.
What?

## What about that?
I tried it.

## How about the thingy next to it?
The thingy next to it has nothing to do with the starter motor...

## What?
Adrenaline's wearing off. You get shaky after. It's not uncommon. Deep breathing helps.

## You better?
I think so.

## What are you doing?
It's a mess.

## 58th and Central. You know it?
South Central.

## How long, you figure?
Oh. Oh, no. You're kidding. We...

## Are you breathing?
Yes.

## What'd he do to you?
Nothing. I only met him the one time.

## What do you care? Ever hear of Rwanda?
Rwanda-Burundi. Central Africa.

## You're a cabby. Like talk yourself out of a ticket?
Please. Don't do anything.

## Good luck. You think they got families?
That one's probably married. Think of his kids. His wife's pregnant...

## Why?
Because I have a gun and I say so.

## Who's that?
Lenny, my dispatcher.

## So what?
I need the job.

## I had no idea these cabs came equipped with emergency strobes. Where's the button? Under the dash?
Yeah.

## What?
Collateral damage.

## I'm...what? Sorry?
Jazz. Music.

## ...see now, this has got a little post- war flavor, a little Miles thing happening. Awesome. What do you think?
I never learned jazz.

## That what we're doing? Flowing?
Damn right. Instinct, man. If you think too much, it doesn't work. Just listen...

## You're the one who keeps talking about going with the flow. You like the man, you like the way he plays. How about a little jazz, huh?
Jazz? That's funny, coming from you. Okay, some jazz for the jazz man. How's this? I'll ask a question.

## What you mean, no?
I'm done. Find another cab.

## Max? What are you doing?
Leave me alone.

## She's in the hospital.
Sure? Like you didn't play him? String him along? If he had gotten the answer right, would you have let him go?

## What difference does it make?
Guy with a routine goes and breaks it? Provokes attention. That's bad. And that's not good...

## Limos, huh?
Don't start.

## She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
Maybe so. Maybe she hears what you tell her.

## Yeah? What happened?
He hated everything I did. Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...

## What happened?
I killed him. When I was 15. He was my first. Nah, wishful thinking. Liver cancer.

## Yeah? Like what? Limos?
I told you I don't like to talk about it.

## Well, this big stake's got to be big by now. When you leaving?
See, I've got bills. My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.

## What, no insurance?
Doesn't cover everything.

## Good excuse. How many others you got?
Gimme your wallet.

## Why?
I'll just hold onto it for you. In case they check.

## In case who checks?
Our friends in Little Russia. Go in and ask for a man named Dmitri.

## Dmitri?
The man who hired me for this contract.

## He's gonna shoot me?
When he finds out you tossed his list? I would.

## Why?
No.

## Paid sick leave?
You tell me to start a union, I'm blowing your head off. Quit stalling and get out of the cab.

## Washington and Holt. Dance club called \"Fever.\" Know it?
Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner. Twelve minutes.

## Your lady friend. The one who gave you her business card. Think she was just being polite?
I don't know.

## I shoulda saved him 'cause he believed you?
No, not just that.

## Yeah, so, what's wrong with that?
It's what I do for a living.

## What's at Union Station?
How are you at math? I was hired for five hits. I did four.

## That's the reason?
That's the \"why.\" That's the why? There is no reason. No good reason; no bad reason. To live or to die.

## Then what are you?
...indifferent.

## As in...?
...all the cabbies in LA, I pull Max, the man with X-ray vision...

## Look in the mirror. ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the Comoros. How much you got saved?
Well. That was brilliant.

## Max?
Let her go.

## What happened?
Guy came in with a gunshot wound, but he died of a heart attack. Go figure.

## Who?
The F.B.I., the C.I.A. You name the initials and they're down there.

## Any special reason?
All I know is, they said to send you and the body to the basement.

## Excuse me?
That's love.

## Geronimo?
Geronimo. When you're really in love, you'll jump. Off the top of the Empire State. Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.

## But you'll die. You'll squash yourself. What's the point?
Aren't you listening, man? Love gives you wings.

## Why the hell not?
I, uh, I have some problems.

## What're you thinking, Jerry?
Water mains usually go in the winter. It's August 1st.

## Mississippi?
Mekong, my friend, Mekong.

## Flip. You're the closest thing I got to a friend around here. Tell me something. You think I'm crazy?
Shut the hell up.

## Come on! Six major earthquakes in the last three years? The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
Testing some top secret seismic weapon.

## Do you still ride?
Not for years.

## Well, I -- Jerry, the point. Get there. What does it have to do with the President?
The President's in Europe. Tomorrow he'll be in Turkey. Right along this fault line. They launched the space shuttle yesterday.

## He's cutting funding for NASA. The milk cow of the aerospace industry. We're talking billions. Motive enough?
NASA is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake.

## You going to warn him?
I can't promise you anything.

## Johnny Dancer. You've been in my office ten times. How come you never asked me about that picture before?
Was waiting till I knew you better. Johnny Dancer, huh? Sounds like a racehorse.

## It's a man without a nose you want, you dumb complicit sons of bitches! You've got to listen to me.
You bit someone's nose off?

## Put down the gun and I'll take your statement. Okay?
You're the boss. Just don't make me repeat myself. I hate that.

## What's the charge?
You were there, Jerry. Figure it out.

## What?
Switch 'em. Or I'll be dead by morning. Don't want to be dead.

## What is?
Love.

## Sure. You switched the charts, didn't you?
It's okay. The guy traded bullets with some old man in a liquor store. He had it coming.

## You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night. Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
You switched the charts; you tell me.

## Really?
I won't be here when you get back, but I'll be in touch. And thanks.

## For what?
You saved my life.

## Figure of speech. Could we go?
If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.

## Them who?
Change lanes. Then watch your rearview.

## Flat, wraparound headlights?
Yeah.

## You mean I should speed up and try and lose them?
Yes.

## See? Wasn't that a lot easier than squealing tires and knocking over trash cans?
Nothing is easy.

## How long have we known each other, Jerry?
Six months. Eleven days.

## You have the right to ask me certain personal questions?
Yeah. I think so.

## What is it with you and the space program?
What is it with you and the space program?

## That's it?
I have no idea.

## So why are they after you?
I'm not sure. I think I figured something out. It must've been in my newsletter.

## So I'm a little jumpy. Who wouldn't be?
You're certifiable.

## You okay?
Flesh wound. No big deal.

## You know why the Grateful Dead are always on tour?
Surprise me.

## Um, coffee. If that's okay?
If my universe had a hub...

## This would be it?
Equitation.

## Are these yours?
Here it is. Conspiracy Theory It just went out Tuesday. Third issue this year. I bet I struck a nerve. Pissed someone off.

## Can you prove any of this?
You're a Holden Caulfield fan.

## Holden Caulfield? Catcher in the?
Never heard of him.

## Was that who I thought it was?
Uh huh.

## Has this happened to you before?
Never, but I've been practicing.

## Who are you, Jerry?
Just a guy trying to put out a fire.

## I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context. Know what I mean?
It made me feel like you could see inside of me. And I don't know how that's possible.

## How is it possible?
I'll give you 100 bucks if you leave right now.

## Is this your dad?
That was him.

## Is he dead?
Please put it down.

## How'd he die?
He was murdered.

## You watch me, don't you?
Johnny Dancer, right? You don't ride him anymore, do you? Not since your dad died.

## What van?
Never mind. You'd think I was making it up.

## Where'd you get your subscribers?
I put an ad on a computer bulletin board. I log on at the library so I can't be traced.

## You haven't been bothering them, have you?
They're dead. Four out of five anyhow. All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.

## Realized what?
Henry Finch. That they monitor everything. That it was only a matter of time. And now four people are dead.

## Elaborate on 'they,' okay?
Cold War's over, Jerry.

## Latest casualty? Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.

## Murdered?
Right here in Manhattan.

## Where then?
Right here. In the 7th Street subway station.

## You will?
If that's what you want. Yes.

## What?
Those are song lyrics, Jerry.

## Yeah... Would you, I mean, could you love me then? If I was normal. Maybe?
Don't do this to yourself. Jerry. You don't love me.

## I thought you -- Why -- Love ruins everything, doesn't it?
You look great.

## No. That wouldn't be fair. Where are we going, Jerry?
It would be a lot easier for me to show you instead of tell you. But first things first.

## What is it?
There's a car following us. Probably another one flanking us the next street over.

## We're going to Queens?
Not today.

## Now what?
This way.

## Where are we going, Jerry?
Connecticut.

## What about them?
How come serial killers have two names, but lone gunman assassins have three. John Wilkes Oswald.

## Then why did you have his picture in your safe deposit box?
He gave it to me.

## Where were you the day he died?
At a horse show.

## Did you kill my father?!
That's the last time you rode, isn't it? Do you think it was your fault? Is that why?

## Jerry. Please. You don't understand. I have to know. It's all I think about. Do you have any idea what it's like not to know?
Yeah. I know what it's like.

## Back where?
Someone else might call it stalking. My dad felt it. He started carrying a gun.

## Why not, Jerry?
Because he believed me.

## How'd you get the picture?
Your father, he was dying. He was worried about you. He took your picture out to look at it. He called you his baby.

## You do?
You got to get out of here. My cell phone's on. Back in the truck.

## How did you know?
I spent two years here. This used to bring the med-cart. Demerol. Phenobarb. It's Jacob's Ladder.

## What about you?
Get up there and we'll get it back down here for me. Now.

## Don't die on me, Jerry. Okay?
I can't promise you anything.

## You think it's a conspiracy?
Don't know, but he looks a lot more like Rosie O'Donnel than Ben Franklin.

## Do I know you?
Yes you do, Jerry. Quite well.

## Lysergic acid diethylamide... With a little kicker of my own. Surely it must be coming back to you by now?
We've arranged for you to take the blame. Everyone knows how you've been harassing the poor girl.

## You're welcome. Where's my partner?
I'm not sure what you mean.

## You made your decision yet?
I'm leaning toward no.

## Can I ask you something?
A dog bit it.

## Excuse me?
You were going to ask about my nose. The poor animal is slated to be destroyed today.

## And you have no idea where he lives?
You've asked me that one three times.

## Why you?
Honestly? I think he has a crush on me.

## Veritas. Truth. What is it they say about truth?
The truth shall make you free.

## Fine. What the hell is going on?
Please, sit.

## It was mind control. Manchurian kind of stuff, right?
A vulgar pop term, but yes. Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin. That was our goal.

## As in Catcher in the Rye?
I am impressed. We used the distinctive cover as a sort of mental flash card.

## Terminal?
As in 'resulting in death.' We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.

## And what did I say?
A dog.

## These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
Yes, that's right.

## If this was a spy novel, your next words would be something like I now know too much to live. Why are you telling me all this?
So you'll believe what I tell you next. Because I need to find Jerry. And I don't think I can do that without you.

## So, you doing anything tonight?
Working.

## Hmm, how about tomorrow night?
Working.

## Night after that?
Look, you're a nice guy, but I'm not really dating right now.

## What do I look like to you? Switzerland?
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

## Do you have an Agent Lowry in your New York office?
Yes.

## Agent Lowry?
Ah, your psychotic is here.

## Dr. Jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate. Why is that?
We don't know who Jonas is. We don't know who it is we're cooperating with.

## What the hell does that mean?
I don't know. Didn't see him.

## It's his show for now. Look, you want to get some dinner? Inter- Agency cooperation and all?
When I'm ready to compare notes, I'll let you know.

## Can I talk to you a second?
Go ahead. We'll be right down.

## Do you believe me?
Yeah, I do.

## Who's the Deputy Director of the F.B.I.?
You think we have time to fool around like this? Come on.

## Nothing. I was just making sure. So, who are you?
I'm, it really doesn't matter. Think C.I.A. and exponentiate. I'm a government employee and I've been watching Jerry for awhile.

## And Jonas?
He's why I watch Jerry. Jerry's the bait for Jonas.

## He's shown himself. Why haven't you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do?
Jonas builds assassins for a living. Several of whom may be in place already. We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone.

## No idea. Honest. What are you going to do?
I'm going to find him. Because he'd find me.

## What do you suggest?
That you come with me.

## What?
I'm not sure. We have no launch protocol; the entry of the passenger is supposed to initiate activation.

## Anything happening in there, El?
We have benzel activation, repeat, we have benzel activation. Control to Arroway, you okay in there? Repeat, Control to Arroway, come back.

## Ellie?
We've lost contact.

## What?
There is no abort procedure -- we don't know how we turned the damn thing on, let alone how to turn it off.

## ... And this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you? As your father?
Yes, sir.

## Is it possible...?
I don't know. Ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.

## Still settling in, really. Where's Dr. Arroway?
Nothing. Okay. Some of us have been a little... not concerned, exactly, but...

## So?
No, thanks.

## Oh? How's he doing?
Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director.

## President's Science Advisor' -- so what, you just spend all your time jetting around on Air Force One now...?
Now exactly. It's... complicated.

## ... could it be a nested code of some sort?
You must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already...

## What? Why?
With me.

## What is it? What's happened?
We've cracked it. Lunacharsky found it.

## Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
Do you have a minute -- ?

## What?
As of three o'clock this afternoon. I submitted my resignation.

## You aren't staying?
This... seemed best.

## What would you have me say, David?
Nothing. I guess I just wanted to thank you.

## Thank you?
For giving me a chance, just for a moment, to feel what it must be like to be you.

## What does it say?
It could be anything. The first volume of some Encyclopedia Galactica...

## How soon will you be able to decode it?
... And while its function remains, for the moment, a mystery, my best guess is that it represents a transport of some kind.

## Dr. Lunacharsky...?
Analyzing signal polarization shifts.

## What?
We've repeated. A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.

## And?
No primer.

## How can that be?
I don't know. Maybe there is a fourth layer in there somewhere, but if there is, I sure as hell can't find it.

## J39 Z186...?
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.

## I'm not sure. You mind checking right ascension 18 hours, 34 minutes; declination plus 38 degrees 41 minutes?
Hydrogen times pi... Got it. Strong sucker.

## How's the spying tonight, guys?
NORAD's not tracking any spacecraft in our vector including snoops; shuttle Endeavor's in sleep mode.

## Dr. Cullers?
Kent, Kent for Chrissakes. You must be Eleanor.

## Ellie. Pulsar?
1919+21. Found a glitch in the timing; probably a starquake.

## Nice. Where?
Here, right around Centaurus A.

## This is how you see the sky?
It's how I hear it. The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.

## Can't we get rid of them?
It's a civilian facility.

## That's terrific, but there's one problem, we don't have the means to receive all the data on our own.
You want to classify prime numbers?

## Is that your official response?
I don't have an official response, Michael. All I have are the same questions you have.

## But what do I say?
Just be yourself, Captain. Find out where he is.

## Could we hear to China?
On that old shortwave? Maybe on a clear night. Come on now, under the covers.

## Could we hear to the moon?
Big enough radio, I don't see why not.

## Could we hear God?
Mmm, that's a good one. Maybe his echo... Okay, no more stalling.

## Time to sleep now, Captain. But you can ask more questions in the morning, okay?
Okay.

## Dad... But tell me, how did... I mean how can...?
You're not real. None of this is.

## So. Are you an hallucination? Or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin?
Am I artifact or dream? You might ask that about anything.

## So who -- what -- are you?
Originally just another species like yourselves. Well, not like you at all actually, but...

## Can you show me?
Small moves, Captain, small moves.

## Why did you contact us?
You contacted us. We were simply listening. We've been listening for millions of years.

## And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
Many others.

## So who...?
We don't know. Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.

## The scale... it's just... So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
Not all. Some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams. Some never make it this far.

## The librarian... or the library...?
... all those voices... you gather them all together. Millions of intelligences in one consciousness... and now we're a part of it.

## So. What happens now?
Now... you go home.

## No! I mean... why so soon?
None taken... but ... do we get to come back? Others of my kind, I mean.

## But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?
No more stalling, Captain.

## Why am I here, Mr. Hadden?
The infamous, unfashionable bluntness. You're here so we can do business. I want to make a deal.

## What kind of deal?
I didn't realize I was out.

## You've... found it. What could I possibly have that you would want, Mr. Hadden?
If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.

## In return... you get the primer -- and with it the power to stay in the game. Do we have a deal?
That's my girl. Done.

## What's that?
Japanese squid fleet. They use lights to attract them to the surface... then turn them into sushi.

## You sound like Joseph. You think the world ends with the millennium?
I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.

## Why don't you come back with me?
I'd say this is slightly different.

## You're implying that the whole selection process is a sham?
... Drumlin said you're been down at Arecibo for the last year.

## And?
I've examined over forty stars of roughly solar spectral type but so far nothing. Still, we've barely started...

## How close are you to getting this funding put together?
It's almost there. The hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time.

## The V.L.A.?
Thirty-one linked dishes. You could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here.

## Greenbank?
I'm going on staff at the N.S.F. To work for Drumlin.

## It's really happening.
But what about your research -- ?

## That you, Valerian?
Like it or not.

## Ellie -- are you okay?
I'm -- I'm fine.

## And where exactly does that put your position...?
I'd have to say I don't know enough to have one yet. For the moment I don't believe the two approaches have to be mutually exclusive.

## And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.

## How do you mean?
Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations.

## Can you try?
I had... an experience. Of belonging. Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone.

## Do you love your parents?
I never knew my mother. My father died when I was nine.

## Did you love him?
Yes. Very much.

## So. Is this kosher fraternizing with the enemy like this?
Some of my best friends are scientists.

## Why?
In other words, God is one hell of an engineer.

## What'd you think?
I thought it was well-written. Heart-felt. And a little bit naive... But that's just the enemy's perspective.

## Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?
I don't follow.

## Do you really believe your life is meaningless?
I don't know. But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.

## It's late. We should go back.
What are you so afraid of, Ellie?

## Ellie... the last time we spoke... I said some things...
An excellent question, Doctor. But what if we don't like the answer?

## I remember. You were indelicate, indiscreet and entirely less than tactful... Sound like anyone you know?
So. The final countdown.

## What...?
I'm sorry.

## Pretty ironic, huh? I had to go all the way to the center of the galaxy... Just to find you.
What is it?

## So. I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?
I'm not sure it's come to that.

## ... but it is a good question, and I suppose I'll always wonder about the answer, Why would they send me back without proof?
In other words, God works in mysterious ways...

## Does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
I'm not sure... Maybe it simply exists in the search for it. Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.

## You have a question, Dr. Arroway?
It's designed purely as a defensive device. Call it a reasonable precaution.

## Oh my God...
How would you propose we handle it, Doctor?

## What is it?
Well. That would seem to decide it. Like it or not, for the moment, anyway, it looks like we're all in this together.

## Recommendations?
Have your department make a full report.

## We work down in the ditch?
Fifty cents? Sweet job like that worth at least a buck.

## How'd you find me?
Helen, she sent along your things with a note, and John here, he wrote to the police.

## We allus thought you was strong enough to carry it. Was we wrong?
No. But things ain't always like they seem, Arletta. You know that. A man's gotta go his own way.

## What are you doin' here?
We call it abuildin' time, Arletta.

## What went wrong?
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.

## A salesman! Cool Hand Luke a salesman?
Yeah. Come on out, Luke.

## Then how come it ain't done yet?
I... I... I...

## You got your mind right, Luke?
Yes, Boss. I got it right.

## How my suppose to handle a dog someone jus' let loose?
Here's the Patrol.

## She's got him! You hear that?
Here, Captain.

## Maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. What was that?
Cuttin' the heads off parkin' meters, Captain.

## Well, we ain't never had one of them. Where'd you think that was gonna get you?
Borrowin'.

## Whatcha got?
Pair'a nines.

## What happened? How far did you get?
Shut up. Let him eat. Don't pay them no mind, boy.

## What for?
Come on, Drag. Lemme take a look.

## A cold drink? Okay?
That's my baby.

## Somebody say somethin'?
I didn't say nothin', Boss.

## Well, whatta we got here?
A Lucas Jackson.

## Oh we got our sources... Tearing the heads off... what was it... gumball machines? What kind of thing is that for a grown man?
Well, you know. Small town, not much to do in the evenings. Mostly it was settling up old scores.

## Whatta you so happy about?
I just always did like truck rides.

## You tryin' to say somethin'?
Slow down, man. They ain't passing out medals for slinging dirt.

## Lucille? Where do you get that?
That'sa Lucille, you mullet head! Any girl so innocent and built like that gotta be named Lucille.

## Innocent?
Stop beatin', man. You ain't doin' nobody no good.

## Where'd the road go?
That's it. That's the end.

## Why'd you have to say fifty? Why not thirty-five or thirty-nine?
Fifty's a nice round number.

## Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?
Nothin' to worry about. We got a deadlock on that mullet.

## What you mean, Luke?
I've done enough world-shakin' for a while. You do the rest for me. Send me a postcard about it.

## Luke. Where you goin?
On my own.

## Do we even get our same bunks back?
Why sure, Luke. I mean I didn't talk to them about that. But why not? They're reasonable, Luke. Hell, we only been gone a coupla hours.

## You don't understand a thing, do you, Drag?
Luke, you got to listen to me. All you got to do is just give up nice and quiet, just play it cool.

## Like I always do?
Thass right. Just play it...

## Maybe we oughta call you No-Ears. You don't listen much, do you, boy?
Not a liar. You just have a common -- and likable -- tendency toward exaggeration.

## You ever eat fifty eggs?
Koko, write down their names, don't just make marks.

## What's the writing say?
Dear Boys. Playing it cool. Wish you were here. Love, Cool Hand Luke.

## Well, how far didya get?
Fat mile'n a half. Hit this red light, highway patrol pulls up alongside.

## That's all there was. Listen. Open your eyes. Stop beatin' it. And stop feedin' off me. Now get out of the way. Give me some air.
A phoney? Whatta you mean, a phoney?

## Koko, why don't you let one of these Newmeats take your broom for today?
Hell, no. I ain't goin' down in the ditch.

## How about you tryin' to make me?
Oh for...

## What are you talking about?
None of your fucking business.

## What did I do?
You threatened to drive her downtown. She has agoraphobia.

## Would you please get your hands off my face, Tallulah? What happened to the newspaper?
I got it myself... I couldn't wait.

## Monsieur Andy can smell your coiffure. And guess what else?
Cellulite. What do you say I blindfold you and take you to the gym. Aerobics with housewives...

## Andy?
You parked right behind him. The one I noticed earlier. I didn't say anything, I thought he'd leave. Just take a look.

## What? What'd I do?
Reminded me that I used to be attractive. That men used to want me...

## About what?
Hal has it.

## You talked to me. Do you remember?
We'll get the paramedics...

## Tell her about what?
Yes. Without question.

## What pattern was that?
The same as the first time...

## What first two murders. We don't know about them here, do we?
He told me he had done two others just like it.

## When was that?
When he was seventeen.

## I was? How you spell that?
Cut the crap. You got a sheet the length of my arm...

## What Friday?
What day is this? In jail you lose track. This week. Friday.

## You break into her apartment to deliver a gift? Where is it?
The door was open, swear to God, I'm just looking for her when you come charging up the stairs...

## Where is it?
I'm trying to tell you. It's on the lady's pillow...

## Kurten! Is he bothering you? I told that son I'd send him what he wanted if he leave you alone.
What book?

## Something personal. Is he bothering you?
I don't know. I'd like to know where he is.

## Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten?
Damn! I gave that to Conrad, too! That guy! I told Conrad deliver to Kurten and keep the 500 bucks in return for getting my book to you.

## Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
In jail.

## Who was the man in the basement?
You like that action? Didn't that cop on TV look solemn? The guy in the basement doesn't matter, anyway, just another lonely heart.

## Where are you, Peter?
You thought I was going to do Ted Bundy next, so you sent your partner...

## It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?
Mm-hmm. I can't get to you. You have to come to me.

## Who is this?
Inspector Halloran, Homicide. I'm in charge here.

## You're calling me a crank?
Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am? Do you know any of the victims...

## If he's not out, why are they here?
Because of your phone calls.

## You don't admire me. No police admire me. I got one of you killed. Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
You, Doctor Hudson.

## Would you want to work with us on this?
Will you go. Andy, make them go.

## Is it an ongoing case?
For months... last October.

## How do you know that?
He felt remorse. He covered her.

## Why imitate a dead serial killer?
Work with me.

## How do you know that?
Look at the bottom of the screen. You see the icon with the arrow pointing left? Click on that... twice.

## Can you make a copy we can show on our computers?
It's too big a file to copy to a disk.

## Look at the sign. 'Hell'? In the Festival of Love? You make any sense in that?
It's anybody. It thrills them to flirt with getting caught.

## Then what do you need me for?
Who turned off the Internet computer...

## Have you got a warrant? Get the hell out o here! This is the only space I have left in the! Why can't you leave me out of it?
That little Winona Ryder manner... you're more convincing as Clint Eastwood.

## Is that it?
That's exactly... I could have taken that same picture, this morning.

## Injected Windex! Why would he switch to a new m.o.?
He'll get caught. If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...

## Why should I trust you?
Because I'm all you've got.

## What's that siren?
One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...

## Ruben's gone to look... It's banged up but it looks like a .44. It's Son of Sam. Is it Son of Sam?
Look in the crowd. He liked to hang around and watch the cops at work...

## What does it matter? This guy, you checked your course records, who signed up?
The University computer is down for maintenance, but I've been going through my own notes...

## I'm working on it! It's what I do. Quinn...Halloran. I'll wait. Where's Andy, can we get some coffee in here?
Out. Where does he go? Nowhere. What does he do? Nothing.

## How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep?
W-We had a fight. I called him... called him a name...

## If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?
Oh, shut up, and don't be so damn self righteous.

## I don't want this. What are they?
You called us, Doctor, if you don't want to look at them here, how about downtown. I'll drive you down...

## The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
In the sixties. He's dead -- stabbed to death in prison.

## It's gone. The file's not here. What did you do?
I just started it copying to tape, but the tape never ran. It just did that...

## I know 'Halloran.' What's the rest of it?
MaryJane. We call her M.J.

## Are you always so bold?
No. I'm shy and I'm selective.

## The problem for me is... you're in the witness category. Know what I mean?
Well. Another time, then. I'll be all right. He's not going to attack me; what I' m rally afraid of is all in my own head, Ruben.

## It's a woman shot in a car?
Yes. I have to go...

## What?...
She on the passenger side?

## Listen to me. Is there a gas station nearby?
Yes.

## Is there a phone booth there?
They all have one...

## I know, baby. I know.
Why don't you shoot off the lock?

## You know how to use this?
They taught me at the FBI. I was very good at it. It scared me... I liked it.

## What else?
Ma'am, please get out of your vehicle...

## We don't see too many lady homicide detectives. You have my respect. Have you discussed the note with Dr. Hudson?
Someone broke into her place last night. It wasn't connected to our case, but it shook her up pretty bad so I haven't...

## How come you're so up on Dr. Hudson?
Okay.

## I'm over here? What's your name, Officer?
Michael Johnson.

## Who came in after you?
Lieutenant Quinn.

## What am I wasting my time with this shit for?
Because it's your job, that's all.

## Not what I meant; why me?
Maybe it's something you did in this life, Nikko...

## If this is just the dump site, where did he do the job? Where did he pick her up?
Doped up kids all over town. Park was full of them last night. Very easy pickin'. Goetz's type.

## Quinn will be here any minute. What are you going to say?
You're in terrible trouble, Nikko.

## I'm sure she thinks it is. Aren't you at least interested in which one it is?
You're good enough you'll never have to kill anyone. I joined the cops to save lives, not waste them.

## He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine. We heard from Doctor Hudson?
Nada. Lemme make the call.

## You said you don't give a fuck and that's the beauty of a breakdown? This doesn't look like not giving a fuck, you know that?
Let's get out of here...

## Is Niccoletti assigned here?
Quinn decided we should form a task force -- they're all one case, now. He wants all the senior detectives on it... She wasn't killed here.

## What about her arms?
Needle marks, fresh, here. look at this...

## What's Abba?
Bunch of Swedish women. You're too young.

## Would you step outside, Sergeant?
I'm telling I tell you to work.

## How about I put Nikko on it?
That's always your privilege, sir.

## Sergeant?
Yessir.

## You ever reflect how this big explosion in dead women coincides with the flowering of women's lib?
Yessir. I have reflected on that, sir. Which explains my gushing deference to you, sir.

## Who've I got to beat up except the messenger? Does this give us anything to go on?
I know. Get out here.

## So. Do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information?
Or for some new nutcase to copycat the copycat.

## Christ. How old are you? You sure you want to be in this line of work?
You're damn right I do.

## Where you going?
Helen Hudson...

## What the hell you need her for?
Because I think I'm wrong.

## Just, I need results. And -- I am short-handed. Who else am I gonna give him?
Give him thatpompous son of a bitch.

## How'd you get in on the deal?
I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's...

## Or the F.B.I.?
Saks. If he knew you did that! They're all asking me, 'what is she doing,' as it is.

## Nikko?
You want mine, too? You take his, you take mine. I'm the one fucked it up...

## I just got here myself, Susan.
\"Spokesperson.\"

## ...confirm this third murder adds up to a pattern? Do we have a serial killer on the loose in the city?
I just got here. Talk to you later...

## Inspector, will you confirm somebody is copying the Boston Strangler? This is the fourth, is that correct?
I don't want the job. Don't do that to her. She's worked too damned hard for it.

## What's going down with the sting in Chinatown? That gonna be off your plate in a week or what?
Put in the Kevin Costner.

## See, now you've annoyed her. You know she doesn't like you to touch me. Does she, widdle wee fing! Wuhve you so much! Did you feed her?
Yes, I fed her. If she says she's hungry, she's lying to you. Again.

## She lies all the time. Why would I say I fed her if I didn't?
That's what I don't know. Why would you lie? That's the problem... I can't understand why anyone would lie.

## Where were you?
In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody could have walked in.

## No. What about your camera girl? Did she come?
We were interrupted. I had to go back to the set...

## And her husband? What was he?
He was a chemical engineer with a food company.

## Where's the car?
Outside in the visitors, car park.

## What!? They brought the car here?
My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station.

## Have you seen it?
The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.

## It is?
After being bombarded endlessly by road- safety propaganda, it's almost a relief to have found myself in-an actual accident.

## What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet?
No, I couldn't. I feel too close to her.

## I've never really noticed. Is Renata going with you?
I thought she might come along. Handling a car again might be more tiring than I imagine.

## Maybe I am a little. James, I've got to leave for the office. Are you going to be all right?
He must have tucked a lot of women in that huge car of his. It's like a bed on wheels. It must smell of semen...

## Do you find him attractive?
He's very pale. Covered with scars.

## Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?
No. But when he's in that car...

## Have you seen his penis?
I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident.

## You'd better drive him. He's a bit shaky. I'll follow in my car. Where is yours?
At home. I couldn't face all this traffic.

## I'd better come with you, then. Are you sure you can drive?
I thought that was you, up there.

## One of your suitors?
One of my suitors.

## The airport? Why? Are you leaving?
Not yet - though not soon enough for some people, I've already found. A death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy.

## So - why the airport?
I work in the immigration department there.

## The Road Research Laboratory? Where they simulate car crashes?
Yes.

## Who is that? The announcer. Do I know him?
That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.

## Is this part of the act or are they really hurt?
I don't know. You can never be sure with Vaughan. This is his show.

## And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars?
Yes. I didn't plan it that way.

## And did you fantasize that Vaughan was photographing all these sex acts? As though they were traffic accidents?
Yes. They felt like traffic accidents.

## Are we allowed to park here?
No.

## There's still a patch of blood there on the road. Did you see it?
I saw the blood. It looks like motor oil.

## Can you drive?
I can drive.

## Really? What kind of exhibition is it?
I suspect it involves reenactments of famous car crashes. You know, Jayne Mansfield, James Dean, Albert Camus...

## What does he want from you?
Hard to say.

## I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan.

## Crash victim?
Yes.

## Do you live here? With Seagrave?
I live in my car. This is my workshop.

## What exactly is your project, Vaughan? ~ book of crashes? A medical study? A sensational documentary? Global traffic?
It's something we're all intimately involved in, The reshaping of the human body by modern technology.

## Is that why you drive this car? I take it that you see Kennedy's assassination as a special kind of car-crash?
The case could be made.

## Where are you?
Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and I have some questions to ask you...

## This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
Yeah, and a dimple.

## What kind of place is this?
I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...

## Do we have to talk about this?
I think in the spirit of group therapy, it's beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others.

## The question, Letty, is how are you feeling?
I miss Beast a lot, too.

## Have you been in contact with the principal about your job?
I thought about calling, but I want to wait until I know when I'll be out.

## Are you saying I'm through with therapy?
So, we'll meet every Tuesday and Friday. And if you have any kind of emergency, you can page me.

## What's up with you?
Me? Nothing. Tell me more about the job.

## How?
I'll talk to her, and to Dad, too. A few wisely-chosen guilt tactics and they'll be ours.

## Mom and Dad? At dinner together? Are you crazy?
Maybe, though. Maybe it would work. I could throw you an engagement party maybe.

## And the party?
Yeah, it'll be fun.

## Where's the old bag I sometimes call Mommy?
She said she'd be here at 10.

## What do you think of this one?
I'd have to see it on.

## But everything's OK?
Yeah, everything's under control.

## What about the engagement party?
Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.

## What about this one?
You look beautiful.

## Really?
Truly.

## What about the souffle? Has that gone in?
Fuck me.

## What's all the dreck?
Sage, rosemary... Les Herbes.

## What do you think?
Ecru.

## Do we have to talk wedding details?
Oh, no, of course not.

## What's his name, Letty?
I didn't say...

## Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do?
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.

## But what am I going to do?
Do you want to go see him? I'll take you if you want to go.

## How wonderful, darling. What does that mean for you?
I'll be running it three days a week, and...

## Will you get time off to do that?
Not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.

## Are you sure, Dear?
Come on.

## Has Paul heard about his promotion?
No, not yet. But you know Paul. He's sure to get it.

## Can I get you a glass of champagne?
I'm here, Sweetheart. I'm here. It's going to be OK.

## Oh, Letty, what happened?
Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened.

## I just want to go home. Can we go home now?
Maybe I should talk about this with Ruth, or Paul.

## But what about Beast? Who'll...?
Ruth's already taken him home.

## And my class. It'll be hard to find a good substitute. And what about my math program?
Paul said he'd call the school. And your father thinks he's convinced the guard not to press charges as long as you get help.

## Tomorrow?
As soon as Dr. Emlee says.

## Which flowers did you order?
I hear this Michael fellow is schizophrenic.

## Must you walk so quickly?
It's good exercise, Mom.

## Not even if it's something positive?
Honestly, Letty.

## I will, Dear. I promise. Why McDonald's?
He's been looking everywhere for weeks, Mom. It's not that easy after you've been locked away.

## Yeah?
It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me.

## Lie?
If you feel lonely, or need to talk, all you have to do is say so.

## Do you mind if I call you Letitia?
Letty.

## First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
I answered these questions last night.

## Let me shift gears here a minute... Do you ever hear voices that other people don't hear or see things they don't?
No.

## What about patterns? Do you find yourself checking and re-checking locks? Or washing your hands over and over again?
Yes? Go right ahead.

## How do you sort it--by lace and cotton?
By color.

## What if it's got a pattern?
Is this really important? Because I don't think it's a problem.

## You took bets on my diagnosis?
It's no big deal. We all compare.

## Who do you think you are?
Don't take it personally.

## What are you looking to read?
Anything interesting.

## Was it bad news--the visit from Peter?
Paul.

## What have you done with the ring?
It's magic.

## Nervous? Scared? Worried you're not fit for a caper of epic proportions?
Don't be ridiculous.

## Thanks. Where've you been all day?
Back-to-back sessions with the shrink.

## What's my rap?
Schizophrenic recidivism marked by hallucinations and paranoid delusions.

## Shocking, huh?
Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.

## I just want to see Beast. Where would you go?
The mission up in Santa Barbara.

## What else would you do?
And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.

## How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?
I do.

## Oh, right. I'm ready. How do I look?
Great. I came to tell you to break a leg, and to give you this for good luck.

## Well?
Home free.

## So there were no problems?
Not a one.

## And did you go to the mission?
Just checking.

## I saw Paul leaving. Did you do the dirty deed?
Yeah.

## Furnished?
No, I need some serious household advice.

## First off, you'll need to go to Target. And, let's see, what should you buy?
I better make a list.

## Where to?
I've heard the mission in Santa Barbara is the place to go.

## You like it?
I love the pillows.

## Do you like it?
I love your apartment.

## What do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate?
Out? Are you kidding? I've got all the fixings here.

## How can you not like the Top 10 List?
I like it. But Headlines are better.

## Did I get spaghetti sauce on my face?
No.

## Yeah?
You've got one hell of a great body.

## Who ever said sanity was fun?
It doesn't matter. It'll work out.

## Promise?
Promise. As long as we have steak.

## Steak?
The store was busy.

## Would you mind if we just called it an early night?
You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.

## Are you OK?
Big restaurant interview tomorrow.

## The restaurant, too?
I couldn't even face that one.

## How may I help you?
Congratulations.

## Aunt Lily is the one who married your father's cousin?
No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker.

## Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
You don't have to know all this by Saturday. It took me years.

## Aunt Lily?
Bingo.

## Bye, Uncle Cort. What's with the lie?
It wasn't exactly a lie.

## What is it? Are you OK?
Always the drugs.

## What?
I saw you talking to my Mom.

## Why'd you tell?
I didn't talk to her about medications, Michael. Don't be silly.

## Silly? Silly am I?
Michael, take it easy.

## Well then why'd it happen?
I don't know. I don't fucking know.

## What do you want to do?
I know I don't want to lose you. I don't think I could stand it.

## Don't you have a magic trick or something to make this easier?
How about something better? Like a kiss.

## Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
I will. And you make sure you take care of yourself.

## It's not another one. It's my sister. Aren't you happy for her?
She's only known the guy a few months.

## In there's better. It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
I really think if you're going to spend your life with someone you want to know them pretty damn well.

## Yeah?
Huntley told me today that if I come through on the Benton deposition, they may consider me for senior associate.

## Actually, I need to review the deposition questions tonight. Maybe tomorrow?
Oh, ok. Maybe.

## But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?
Sure. Of course.

## Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime?
Yes.

## Sure. Why?
I'm going to the store.

## Are you all right?
That's a big question.

## Of course not, no. Is that why you're here?
I think we need to talk about some things.

## So, what do you say, Let?
Sure. We'll save the formal announcement for when you're out. I already told your mother. I hope you don't mind.

## So will you?
Of course. Yes. I will. I do.

## You can tell me anything. Do you want to postpone the wedding? Is it too much pressure?
No...

## You what?
I don't mean to hurt you. I know this is a terrible thing. And I have really loved you.

## Who?
It doesn't matter who.

## Have you been seeing another teacher?
No.

## You're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love?
Here's the ring.

## How's work going? Are you back at school?
I start on Monday.

## What?
I heard your friend was back in the hospital.

## What does that mean?
I need someone to work on budget projections.

## Office work?
Or, of course, you could take a sabbatical the rest of the year.

## How's it look?
Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.

## So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds to trade up for his brother?
Agent Hadley.

## Do you know who this is?
Yeah. I figured I'd be hearing from you.

## What are you doing?
You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.

## I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?
A pass.

## No. I have it. The lamp? The one with your fingerprints and her blood on it? Remember?
You want the tapes for yourself. You're going to sell them.

## What about me? Aren't I a loose end?
And you're a dirty cop. At least I don't pretend to be something different than what I am.

## Hey, you're not exactly the most trustworthy guy in the world. I took a shot. It didn't work. Did you bring the tapes?
You want the tapes for yourself. You're going to sell them.

## I thought you wanted Zammito?
Too many people know about my involvement in this.

## Not today. Where are your friends?
They left about a half hour ago.

## Where did they go?
I swear man, I don't know. They packed up and left a half hour ago. All I got is one of their phone numbers in Paris.

## Hello?
It's Elvis...

## Who?
It's me...

## Marcel?
Yes. We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy.

## You're there now?
Oui.

## You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
No.

## You're calling me on is phone?
Oui.

## Hey Daniel! Hello? Do you guys speak English?
Uh, yeah.

## C'mon, Laurant, America?
The job is worth about two million euros. Pull this off and you and your crew could make some real money, Daniel. You leave tomorrow.

## What?
This is a considerable move up for you, Daniel. The temptation of having so much money might be too much for you.

## Hello?
It's Daniel.

## Good. I'm doing good. How you doin', Frankie?
Good. I'm good.

## Can I offer you something. A drink? Coffee?
No thank you.

## -- Super what?
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.

## Okay. How much?
I'm not here to negotiate.

## Why are you here?
To tell you that we're interested in the property.

## Frankie, come in. Good to see you. You want something?
No, I'm good, Angelo.

## And?
And nothing. He's just feeling us out.

## They're gonna be what?
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.

## You know, I'm kind of tired. I'm just gonna go home if it's all the same to you.
Someone else coming?

## Oh Frankie, what's this I hear about your brother?
He missed three weeks.

## Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it?
I did. Joey \"Two Tons\" and Nicky \"The Rake\" did the deed.

## But you were there?
Angelo, we live and die by the rules we make. We are men of honor, but honor without respect is a... horse-less carriage.

## Why didn't you tell me about this?
You have enough to worry about, Angelo. You don't need my problems.

## They knew who you were when they broke in your house?
Yes.

## Either you are incredibly brave, or incredibly stupid. Which one is it?
I've got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This guy's an idiot. How he's lived this long is a mystery.

## I assume you want something?
We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.

## And for my help I would get what?
Half the tapes.

## And the other half?
I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.

## Where are you staying?
I only ask so I can call you when the arrangements are made.

## How about if I call you?
This plane will take you to Canada. From there you can fly back to Paris.

## Tonight?
I know they won't be home tonight.

## For what?
Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.

## What kind of business?
Too risky. We don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car.

## Why do I always have to answer the phone?
Because you're the closest.

## Why is everything an argument with you?
I'm just setting my boundaries.

## Where are you from?
Hopefully no one.

## No one? Then why is Zero here?
I just want you there in case there's trouble.

## And if there is, then Zero can kill someone?
We'll see.

## What about the money?
Bring me the scissors.

## You didn't buy batteries?
I thought they came with batteries.

## What for?
I think he's already figured that out.

## Did you know about Bastaldi's deal with Zammito?
No.

## You're sure?
I think if he told me he was going to steal Van Gogh's \"Sunflowers in a vase\" I would remember it.

## Do I?
This ain't about that and you know it. This is about you never forgiving me for leaving the crew.

## You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?
Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night.

## What is that a threat? Are you fuckin' threatening me, Marcel?
That's Frankie Zammito. The Under boss of the Chicago Mafia.

## How'd it go? I don't know. Daniel, how would you say it went?
I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.

## You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
No. Chicks dig me.

## It makes sense. I mean, do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up?
I think he'd cut his dick off if Bastaldi told him to.

## No?
Even if we get out of town and go to another airport I'm sure the FBI and Chicago P.D. has alerted customs.

## Hello?
Get out of the room! You've got company coming up. I'll meet you at the Chevy.

## What'd you get?
Some bread and...

## Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.

## Does it really matter what I say?
I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.

## Did you have to use that much explosive?
I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.

## Guns. Can you get them?
Man, I can get anything.

## I ain't no rat. You got money, right?
And, uh, I'm going to have to charge you a commission... kind of like a brokerage fee.

## A thousand dollars?
Fine.

## Yeah?
We had a deal.

## What?
I'll tell you when it's time.

## Okay, we're square now, right?
There's just one more thing I need you to do.

## Tell me the truth Hector... do you think we'll find my car?
Hard to say.

## TONS\" French guys? You mean like from France?
Yeah, French guys from France.

## TONS\" What'd they take?
Everything.

## TONS\" Everything?
Everything.

## Great fuckin' song.
TONS\" Okay boss. Where are they?

## TONS\" What'd you guys find?
Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates.

## TONS\" And the other car?
Some French guy. At least that's what his passport said. You know Joey, I shouldn't be talking to you about this.

## TONS\" Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
A Wallet. A hotel room card. Some cash.

## TONS\" What hotel?
The Holiday Hotel.

## TONS\" What room number?
I don't know. I didn't look.

## What do we do?
I was told to take what we have and go.

## What about transportation?
You can use my car.

## Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
Yes.

## What is it you do, Sami?
You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.

## What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
This kind.

## This is bad. This is really fuckin' bad. Am I the only one who sees how bad this is?
Hey, it's not your picture on the TV, it's mine. So, try to be cool.

## That's brilliant! Care to elaborate?
Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but why aren't we leaving town? Any place has to be safer for us than Chicago.

## What the hell is he talking about?
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.

## No. How much?
I don't know. It's gotta be millions.

## Going somewhere?
Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody else. If I knew it was you I would have never run.

## Me?
You lived there. You know the city.

## Mr. Taylor?
No, that's not Mr. Taylor.

## Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?
\"Vase with twelve Sunflowers.\"

## You guys used to work together?
RAKE\" He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.

## RAKE\" Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?
Get in the car.

## What happened?
RAKE\" They sort of got away.

## Anybody know about that car outside?
Uh huh.

## You see that car?
Yeah.

## No shit?
The papers for the car will arrive tomorrow.

## No problem, man. Hey, you wanna hit?
No thank you.

## How are we going to do that?
I know where she went.

## He speaks about himself in the third person?
Feel free to correct him if you want.

## Oh, you think?
Holy shit.

## How do we know what room she's in?
Wait here.

## Where is it, Sophie?
It's simple. Bastaldi's moving up. He's closing down his operation and this is his way of saying thanks to all of us.

## The new Beaujolais' come out in France next week. You like wine?
I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.

## J&amp;B?
Glenmorangie.

## You put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs? How stupid is that?
Zero did not put it in his bag. He put it in yours.

## You wanna tell him?
It has to be at Sophie's. She didn't have time to go anywhere else before she came here.

## And how do we do that?
I don't know.

## When do we go?
Tonight.

## You ever hear of jet lag?
Take a nap.

## You like shoes?
No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.

## Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information.

## So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed?
They're not nice people.

## Casandra. Old girlfriend?
Something like that.

## Did she break your heart?
Something like that.

## It looks old. Did you get it a long time ago?
You ask a lot of questions.

## That's how you get to know someone. Did it hurt when you got it?
I don't remember. I was drunk.

## No. I got it in prison. I went in for three years. When I came out she was married to my best friend. Happy?
Sorry. I didn't mean to pry.

## Who's gonna see it there?
The lucky ones.

## Can't sleep?
No.

## What are you doing?
I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.

## Who are you waiting for?
Stick around and find out.

## Why?
Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.

## Yeah. I'm going home today. What do you want, Frankie?
I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.

## What's this?
A car.

## Oh really? Thanks. I thought it was a sewing machine. What the hell is it doing here?
It's for you.

## For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?
Much better. You've been gone so long.

## I don't care about your sword.
Who are you?

## This Jade Fox is a woman?
Yes.

## Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword?
I do as I please.

## Do you think you are a real master?
Like most things, I am nothing. It's the same for this sword. All of it is simply a state of mind.

## Why do you want to teach me?
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.

## And if I use them to kill you?
That's a risk I'm willing to take. Deep down, you're good. Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.

## My name is Li Mu Bai. The Green Destiny is mine. Jade Fox can't be your master. Where did you learn that \"Xuan Piu\" move?
BLACK I'm just playing around.

## You're home late... or should I say early?
Why are you still here? You killed a policeman. You should leave! You'll bring ruin on my whole family.

## That was just for fun. How can I leave? Where would I go?
Long.

## Please sit.
So what if I don't?

## I've made you silk pajamas. Do you want to change into them?
Put them down.

## Do you know her?
She's one of those. Your mother would not want you consorting with her kind.

## Li Mu Bai! The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
You're too young to understand.

## You're a sword fighter too?
Yes, I am. But I prefer the machete. Certain moves, however, call for a sword.

## But you're just like the characters in the stories.
Really?

## Sure. No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books?
You know what I mean. I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.

## What do you think?
No! You couldn't roam around freely if you were.

## How so?
I'm bored.

## You're doing calligraphy?
I'll write your name. Just for fun.

## No, really?
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.

## Go back to them first. Then you can decide about Lo.
You say she killed a policeman?

## You know about Lo?
He really loves you. Come back to Peking with me. We'll find a solution.

## Where is he now?
Don't touch it! That's Li Mu Bai's sword.

## What do you want?
What I've always wanted, to teach you.

## No more hitting on the head! All this trouble for a comb?
It's mine. It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.

## Mu Bai...It's been too long.
Do you remember the legend of the young man?

## Good. And how are you?
Fine.

## Something I can't let go of. You are leaving soon?
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.

## The Green Destiny Sword? You're giving it to Sir Te?
I am. He has always been our greatest protector.

## So what will you do now?
Come with me to Peking. You can give the sword to Sir Te yourself. It'll be just like old times.

## What have you discovered?
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.

## Did you see who posted it?
No.

## It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's. On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu's. Were you involved?
It was Bo, Sir Te's man. I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'.

## Have you questioned him yet?
No, not yet...

## But your men are watching over Yu's compund?
No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods.

## What do you mean? Didn't you come back here for it?
I don't know it was stolen until I got here.

## Then, why did you come?
Well, we had talked...

## You think Jade Fox will show up?
She's out there, but I doubt she'll show herself. We'll keep our eyes open. Sooner or later, she'll come for the girl.

## Not everything is an illusion. My hand... wasn't that real?
Your hand, rough and callused from machete practice... All this time, I've never had the courage to touch it.

## What about you?
I'll look around and catch up later.

## Jade Fox drugged her. How did you get here?
We followed Jade Fox.

## That can't be! Everything has an antithesis! Why not this?
Mu Bai, hold on. Give me some hope...

## A murderer?
Yes. The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master. Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.

## What does it say?
\"We'll settle this at midnight on Yellow Hill.\" Good, the fox is out of her hole.

## Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.

## What do you have in mind?
The best way to trap a fox is through her cubs.

## Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.

## What in the hell... do you call that?
I call it blood, Detective. If you want, you can call it graffiti.

## You buying?
I'm buying.

## No onions?
They make you fart.

## Just don't tell me you \"owe me one.\" What file?
Double homicide. A year ago. Las Halloween.

## Are you nuts, walking into a gun?
You went out the window. She was beaten and raped. She died in the hospital.

## Right. You sure I can't just take you to the emergency ward?
They couldn't do anything for me.

## How 'bout the morgue?
No. I have one more thing to do.

## Mom --?
I told you you're not supposed to come in here.

## I was wonderin' where you'd gotten to -- Oh, Elly, honey, a cat. Here?
He was a present. Besides, we're moving anyway. You said.

## Hey, Darla -- before we die of old age, how about it --?
Out. Now. I gotta work.

## I dabble. May I?
My mom works over there. I'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now.

## Who?
Mister Funboy.

## Mister Funboy lives there?
He has a room, upstairs. I don't like him very much.

## Does she have a name?
No name. You sure ask a lot of questions.

## What's going on...?
A remembrance. A closure.

## I remember him! Here, Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours?
I think he's yours, now.

## You're not gonna come back, are you?
I don't know if I can. But you have this... and you know where to come.

## What's goin' on, Elly?
I went to see a friend of mine.

## Well, how's your friend?
She's still dead.

## You're not a cop, either. What do you want him for?
I'm looking for a good guitar man.

## Do you know what you destroyed?
Take the dope, too.

## Rowdy. Let me fill in some gaps for you.
It's yesterday! Do you know what you destroyed?

## Cute nickname, don't you think?
I ain't got no fuckin' ring.

## Another jolly nickname?
You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar.

## T-Bird?
Like the car. He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there. Ask Top Dollar.

## How the hell did you do that?
Magic.

## What the hell are you?
Interested? Follow the crow.

## Miss her?
Yes.

## You work for the dead. Forget that, and you can forget it all.
Get it?

## Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we?
Go away.

## What... the hell is that?
This is a cobra, Mr. Grange. Yes, it is real.

## Kill a dead guy?
We've got company.

## Is he inside?
I've got him if you want him.

## Who got himself what?
One of mine. And it wasn't a standard hit.

## I know of no one. But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
Anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.

## \"Our\" Crow...?
The night is young.

## Nice speech. What's it supposed to mean?
Your comprehension is not required. Your cooperation and, indeed, your ability are the issues on the table.

## Have we met?
I don't think so.

## Did you know Sebastian well?
You might say that.

## Are you okay?
I'll be fine.

## Excuse me?
You heard me.

## Actually, I was planning on running down to Kinkos. Do you think you could give me ride?
You can't do this to me. It could ruin me.

## No. I mean. I don't know. What else do you know about him?
Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit.

## What do you mean?
Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he's loaded.

## From who?
I can't tell you. I'm sworn to secrecy.

## Annette, how long have we known each other?
Forever.

## You promise not to say anything?
On my mother's life.

## So what year are you going into?
Junior.

## Got a boyfriend back home?
No.

## Why not?
I don't know. Relationships seem too distracting. I'd rather concentrate on my studies.

## You a lesbo?
No.

## Are you often this offensive on a first encounter?
I was just being honest. You happen to have a nice ass. Sorry.

## You did?
I must say I found it rather appalling.

## How do you know I've been with several women?
A friend wrote me.

## Who the hell is taking the time to write letters, spreading this shit about me?
It's not really important.

## Why are you being so dramatic?
Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.

## What'cha reading?
The Fountainhead.

## You've read The Fountainhead?
Romantic? He rapes her.

## How's the water?
Refreshing.

## About what?
About what you said today in the stable. I'm not a happy person.

## Why not?
Because you act like a pig.

## Do you deny that there's an attraction between us?
I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.

## Need a lift?
No thank you.

## How are you today?
Give it up.

## And that's a bad thing?
I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.

## Don't you believe in love at first sight?
Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.

## Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
I can't. I'm seeing a friend.

## Who?
That's none of your business.

## How about tonight?
I'm busy.

## Doing what?
That's also none of your business.

## You truly want to do something to make me happy?
Yes.

## And you promise to abide by it?
Without question.

## What?
If that's a problem, then I'll make arrangements to stay with some friends.

## I'm... I'm alright.
I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?

## How was your date?
It wasn't a date. He's just a friend.

## What are you doing?
Reading.

## What are you reading?
Of Human Bondage.

## Alone again. What are you up to today?
I'm doing some volunteer work.

## Need any company?
You? Volunteer? I don't think so.

## It's weird. I actually feel good about myself. Can we do this again next week?
Oh please.

## Lighten up.
What?

## I am lighten. Can we drop this?
Fine.

## Oh dear, are you actually laughing?
No.

## Am I bothering you?
Not at all. Have a seat.

## You don't know Monsieur Philipe?
Bonjour Monsieur Philipe.

## Why are you doing this?
Because I'm in love with you.

## You really want to know?
Yes.

## Where are you going?
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.

## How am I a hypocrite?
Please don't go.

## Would you like a tour?
Sure.

## Why aren't you understanding?
I love you.

## Why are you trying to hurt me?
I'm just being honest. I just wanted to see what you were like in bed.

## Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding?
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.

## I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west. What's his name?
Ben Schwarz.

## Schwarz. Jewish?
German.

## Any ideas who it could be?
Blaine, if I knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now.

## Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
Greg McConnell.

## The football stud?
He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat.

## What do you mean?
Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.

## Are you shitting me?
Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.

## Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?
Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight.

## No problem. Just make sure your front door is unlocked. Shall we say the \"stroke of midnight\" no pun intended?
I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter.

## What are the boys like?
Cecile, is that the best you can do? You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never been in a co-educational atmosphere before.

## Where did you find those?
Margarita found them while cleaning your room.

## What was that?
I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a beautiful language.

## Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
Eww. No. That's gross.

## Do you want to learn or not?
I guess. It still sounds gross.

## What are you saying?
Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.

## That's so romantic. Have you responded?
No.

## Well do you like him?
I don't know.

## Did you hide the letters?
Yes. They're in this antique doll house in my room.

## Of course I would. We're friends, right?
Best friends.

## Who is it?
It's Kathryn.

## Does your mother know?
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.

## Why didn't you do something?
I don't know.

## Well what then?
If that's what you call it.

## Well did you like it?
Cecile, you had an orgasm.

## I did?
I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.

## I am?
Now listen. Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him instruct you.

## But that would make me a slut. Wouldn't it?
Cecile, everybody does it. It's just that nobody talks about it.

## What year are you in?
I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.

## You think he'll like it?
He'll love it.

## What are you doing?
Just taking your photo.

## And then I can go home?
Of course. I'm not a monster.

## Just a kiss, right?
I swear.

## What are you doing?
You promised to let me kiss you.

## Want to join me?
Some other time, Cecile.

## Am I suppose to be this sore?
For the first time, yes. It'll pass.

## Is it me?
No, you were fine.

## Where are you going?
I'm taking a shower.

## Need any company?
No.

## Want a blow job?
Good night Cecile.

## Don't you want to change that?
I think that's all the time we have for today.

## Same time next week?
No. This is going to be our last session.

## You do?
I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble.

## Really? Care to make a wager on that?
Good luck, Sebastian.

## What, nervous I'm going to win?
Would you please leave.

## Honey, is something wrong?
He told me he loved me and I believed him.

## Who told you?
You don't know him. I'm so stupid.

## Greg, is that you under the covers?
Get out of here.

## Did you do everything I asked you to?
Yes.

## And you think she bought it?
I'm pretty sure she did.

## Pretty sure or sure sure?
She bought it.

## Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?
No.

## Yeah?
It's Kathryn.

## Hi Kathryn. Is everything okay?
No.

## What's wrong?
It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.

## What do you mean?
I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over.

## And this happened before you and I hooked up?
It's been going on for a while. Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.

## Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house?
I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.

## Lovely. How is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my inheritance per usual?
Hopefully, though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid.

## What?
Sorry.

## So that's what this is all about. We'll get together and plan your curriculum.
You don't mean?

## I see your point... though why should I care?
I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.

## Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
That was just simple revenge. What I have planned requires sheer genius.

## Jesus Christ, is she for real?
Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue.

## Care to make a wager on that?
I'll think about it...

## What are the terms?
If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine.

## And if I win?
I'll give you something you've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married.

## Even there?
It would feel so yummy.

## Fuck her yet?
I'm working on it.

## What's wrong with you?
Interesting.

## I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter?
No.

## What's your plan of attack?
I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.

## But who will they turn to for help?
I'm at your service.

## Have you succeeded in your task?
Any day now.

## Who are you calling?
Cecile.

## Who are you spying on?
Take a look for yourself.

## That her?
Yeah.

## What's your problem?
Nothing.

## And that's why you're losing your bet?
I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.

## Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
Kathryn, the only thing you're going to be riding is me. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some work to do.

## Well I know how it went with Cecile. She won't shut up about it. How'd it go with Mrs. Jesus?
If your asking if I nailed her the answer is no.

## So what went wrong?
I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it.

## Where is she?
You don't know? She left thirty minutes ago.

## Bad time?
Kind of.

## You didn't?
Oh yes.

## Oh come on. For her first time?
No, tell me.

## Excuse me?
I'm not in the mood.

## And that's why you're leaving?
It clearly is why.

## What's wrong with you? Why are you acting this way?
I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're in love with her. You don't love me anymore.

## Is that what you think?
That's not fair. You're taking all the fun out of it.

## Why so nervous?
I've never done this before.

## Screening calls. Any suggestions?
A little melodramatic, don't you think.

## Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
You wanted an answer to your question.

## Annette?
Devastated beyond repair. I doubt she'll ever trust a man again.

## Ronald?
Not that it's any of your business but yes.

## Thank you. Now, where were we?
To my triumph, of course.

## Come again?
In any event, you still owe me my reward.

## Didn't you hear what I said?
I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.

## And if I don't?
Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.

## How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength?
That's beautiful.

## Not at all. What's wrong?
It's Cecile.

## What about her?
Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...

## Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?
It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher.

## You will be discreet about this?
Absolutely.

## Is that so?
Got me off the streets? I live on 59th and Park.

## Hi. Is Annette at home?
You must be Sebastian. I've heard such nice things about you.

## What do you want?
I need to talk to Annette.

## Do you know where she is?
She's out.

## Yes, you already did.
Do you know when she'll be back?

## I did?
Right after we played backgammon.

## We played backgammon?
Uh huh. You beat me three times.

## I did?
Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.

## I said, do you want some water?
Oh... no thank you...

## What time is it?
Eight o'clock. You got to go.

## Did she show up?
Nope.

## Do you mind if I check upstairs?
I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day.

## How will I get to her?
Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.

## But you don't keep a cat, do you?
I didn't know Mr. Reed had been married before.

## That the old actress -- Julia Farren?
Yes, She's a little odd, I understand.

## Does she go up to the Farren's often?
No. I only let her go with Edward. It's alright.

## How?
I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.

## What song, dear?
The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.

## Did you ever make a wish?
Oh, lots of times.

## Did your wishes ever come true?
Sometimes.

## But where did you get it, Amy?
At the old house with the voice.

## Do you know the people?
No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.

## Are they nice?
I really don't know, but I do know that you must return the ring. You get Edward to take you up there and bring it back to the old lady.

## It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
She was very pretty.

## What's her name?
Irena.

## Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.

## I wonder if you don't resent that in her?
I'm sure I don't, Alice. It's something else -- something moody -- something sickly -- She could almost be Irena's child.

## Darling, no father could be nicer to a child than you are to Amy.
You make me sound like the father in \"East Lynne.\"

## Why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile?
I forgot I had it on.

## Where is everybody?
It's early yet.

## All right, Ollie. Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.
It's nearly a quarter after four. The party was for four, wasn't it?

## I think I should. 3000W?
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings. Neither of them received invitations.

## My, my, what a coil we're in! What's this all about?
Amy's been lying again.

## What is it, Alice?
I thought Amy was calling. I guess not.

## What?
It's your play.

## Where did you get it?
Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.

## What's funny?
Oliver, please. Let's not go on with this. The child's trembling.

## Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.

## Is that my birthday cake? May I see?
You'll see it when it's all lit and ready for you.

## Amy, you remember the party invitations Edward, gave you to mail?
Yes, daddy.

## Did you mail then?
Yes, I did.

## Where did you mail them?
I wanted to talk to you, I wanted to tell you about the other children.

## Can't you tell me later?
But I didn't play with them, Daddy. They wouldn't play with me.

## What do you mean you didn't play with the other children?
It was on account of the birthday party.

## Because you didn't ask them? I don't blame them for being angry. Why didn't you explain what happened?
They ran away.

## It's true.
Why didn't you run after them?

## And who did the voice belong to?
It was just a voice.

## Amy, answer me. Why did you call her your friend?
Because she is my friend.

## Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
Don't you see her?...Right there, under the tree.

## Daddy?
Yes, darling.

## What'd you get for Christmas?
I don't know yet.

## My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?
No.

## Who are you?
You called me by my name.

## Irena. But who are you?
I'm your friend.

## But where is that?
I can not tell you.

## Will you be friend for always?
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.

## You'll always play with me?
Whenever you want.

## Can't you get it, darling?
I'll just never learn arithmetic.

## A princess?
Of course. And Two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.

## Your children?
My dolls. We can pretend.

## I can sea its breath in the cold.
You and I shall enjoy Christmas together. Shall I show you my Christmas gift to you?

## May I pet the deer?
It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.

## You?
Yes, Amy.

## But why?
Getting the yard all fixed up for your party, Amy. You'd better hurry and get yourself fixed up too.

## A ring that I can wish on like I wished on the candles?
Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.

## the ring up to him) What's a mourning ring?
Well, if it's a real mourning ring,. I'm going to think hard for something I want more than anything else in the world before I wish.

## Will you come soon?
Soon as I finish.

## That means I can go alone?
About time for you to come home, Amy.

## But I don't want you coming here alone. You get me to go with you when you want to come here. You promise?
There was a deer on the other side of the fence.

## But what happened to the little deer?
Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.

## Why is it just lying there? Why doesn't it get up?
Because it can't. It's dead.

## There you are. Take some cake, why don't you?
No, thank you.

## Then I'll tell you a story  a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?
It was shot off long ago in the great battles that were fought here; with the British on one side and the Americans on the other.

## Hide me? Why?
My little girl said she'd kill you if you came to see me. I can't let you die. We'll have to hide you.

## Oh, doesn't that prove something to you? Doesn't it?
Anybody could know that song.

## Look at me. Look at me, mother darling. Look into my eyes. What color eyes did Barbara have?
Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray.

## And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
It was pale...a shadowed gold.

## Such a brief visit, but dear child, it has made my Christmas very merry.
What is it, ma'am?

## Everything all right down there at the school, Mr. Reed?
Yes, everything's all right, Edward.

## \"To Daddy from Amy.\" Here's one for Miss Callahan. This one says, \"To Edward from Amy.\".
And Amy mailed them?

## Good heavens! What could you be giving me. Little Miss?
I know it may seem stupid of me--but it isn't the slap I'm worried about -- it's the reason.

## Can we get some service here?
No way is that the same chick. The other one was a dog.

## Guess you like those Coyote Ugly steaks now, huh?
Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.

## Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem like all the cool people smoke?
No.

## What?
Your lips look delicious.

## I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?
Never felt better.

## A bite... Where'd you get bitten?
At Victoria's Secret.

## I mean where on your body?
Oh, on my wrist.

## A dog at Victoria's Secret?
No, it was another woman.

## How's the rest of your health?
Good. Except for PMS.

## PMS. What symptoms are you experiencing?
It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...

## What else is there?
And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.

## That bite healed up quickly. It's been about three weeks?
Nearly four.

## Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. You don't seem hairy to me. Is that all?
I get crazy dreams and I black out.

## Does she have PMS?
Now it's menopause. She's always hot. I gotta wear a parka around the house cause she keeps it so cold. It's always something.

## Jennifer?
No it's mom.

## You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?
No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.

## Do you really need these?
Only to see.

## Can't you get contacts?
No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.

## What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie?
It's not about him seeing you in it. It's how you feel. You'll feel sexy in lingerie and it'll show. It's an inner thing.

## Where are all the mediums?
Frida, grab that red one.

## Can you believe she fuckin' bit me?
And she got the medium.

## George bit you?
Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!

## Hey, did you get contacts?
Oh, my glasses! Maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them.

## He's dead? Am I bad luck or what?
There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.

## And he was ripped limb from limb?
I'm sure they were exaggerating.

## Why would they exaggerate?
To sound like big macho cops. He was probably just found with a knife in his back.

## No, did you fuck him?
No. I don't think so.

## And then?
I think I went in and fell asleep. I guess Gregory walked home and got killed! I blacked out.

## Are those Mark's?
No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already.

## Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? When did you see him?
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.

## Frida, I'm your friend. I'm not judging you... You didn't sleep with the creep did you?
I don't think I've ever actually liked anyone I've dated before. Peter even likes me without makeup.

## I don't know much about him. How do you know if a guy is decent?
Give him the tampon test.

## What the hell is the tampon test?
We almost slept together... and... then the hair started and I booked.

## What did he say?
I think he called you beautiful.

## Please come over. I'm begging you. What should I do with the arm? Should I call the cops or... Peter?
Frida, you're not making sense. I can't come over right now.

## So where's this infamous arm now?
I put it down the garbage disposal.

## You're a PMS werewolf. Of course. Frida, are you on drugs?
It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!

## Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?
I don't know. You have to take Sammy. He's afraid of me.

## Tuesday. Are you okay?
Shit, I guess I missed work.

## Did you get rid of Mark?
I don't know... I'm spaced out... he was taking a shower... He must be still in there.

## First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.
He's been here all night?

## What? Why'd you do that?
There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.

## How could I? I'm helping you clean up Mark's remains and you ask how could I cheat on George?
You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.

## Why the fuck would you do that?
I could smell another woman on him.

## You expecting someone?
No.

## What the fuck are we going to do?
Hide him.

## Does that mean this whole thing is over?
Probably for three weeks or so anyway. I'm not sure -- I don't get how it works.

## So what do I do?
Fall in love.

## But how do I know if I really love Peter? And if he really loves me?
I guess you'll find out.

## About Mark? Carlton?
About Benito.

## Did I kill a guy named Benito?
No, he's the guy I'm having an affair with.

## Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you're going to be okay?
Yes, just check on me once a day for the next three days. Then the PMS should be over.

## Frida? You okay?
Never been better. Peter spent the night. I must really love him. He's still alive.

## So you're Grant's secretary?
I do development for TV movies.

## You hungry?
Starving.

## Well, whattdaya think?
That's great. Highly original.

## Hey, how about a little nightcap?
I'm really tired.

## Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?
No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.

## What?
I really gotta pee.

## Knock what off?
You don't have to pee.

## Since when do you care?
You look different. I mean you look good.

## You do though. You look really... is that a wonderbra?
No.

## Worried about what all your girlfriends might think?
Frida, you know you're it for me.

## I'm kinda borrowing it. Who's this, Mr. Date-Guy?
Frida? I hear you talking. I know you're in there. Let me in.

## You think that story's gonna make me loan you money?
It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.

## I just need a place to lay low for a few days. Come on, I know you hate me but you can't wanna see me at the bottom of the East River?
Mark.

## Yeah?
Wow.

## The Nielson's?
On your desk.

## Script coverage?
On your desk.

## Did you change your hair?
A little.

## Mr. Grant. Did you read that script I was talking about?
No.

## No?
No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.

## When's the last time you saw him?
We... he walked me home and... we said goodnight. Um, he kissed me goodnight and that was it.

## Intriguing?
I gotta get going. Peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag.

## You wanna get some coffee?
I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.

## So what book did you buy?
Oh, it's nothing.

## Used to? Did it stop finally?
No, she died when I was twelve.

## Oh my god, by wolves?
I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.

## Like what?
You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear.

## How about you? Briefs or boxers?
Briefs.

## Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
He's bad news. He cheated on me, he insults me. Now suddenly he gets jealous if I have a date.

## Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
Yeah. Maybe.

## What are those?
Silver bullets. A collectors item. These are very valuable. They were melted down from a crucifix.

## What are they for?
Oh just my wolf paraphernalia. Some people collect beanie babies... I collect silver bullets.

## Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?
My period? No.

## I mean we can still... whatever... Maybe I should get a towel?
No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don't want our first time to be like this.

## Oh my god, you scared the shit out of me. You following me again?
No. I was doing my laundry.

## Was there anything in that washer?
No. Nope, nothing in it.

## You sure? It's my favorite shirt, mind if I check?
NO! I... I checked when I put my stuff in. I always look through the washer first.

## Everything okay?
A man killed in Central Park.

## You had a date with Carlton?
It wasn't a date. Jennifer invited me along to dinner with them.

## But you said the bodies were ripped to pieces?
Still haven't figured out how he or anyone else pulled that off. Never seen anything like it.

## No, why?
He was ripped to shreds also. In his apartment.

## I need to talk to you. About us. Frida... I... Can I carry your box?
No, I got it. It's okay.

## What happened?
I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it's unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case and all.

## Did I tell you I have the worst sense of humor and I make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times?
No, but thanks for the warning.

## Is that how you feel?
Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.

## What's with the squirt guns?
They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.

## Hello?
Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over.

## What? Is there someone else?
Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really.

## Yes or no? Frida, can't you just be honest with me?
You at least owe me the truth.

## You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.

## How do you know?
I don't think you would. No matter what form you take.

## Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?
No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.

## Worse than this?
Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.

## Let's explore this. What makes you feel you're a werewolf?
I ate a guy last night.

## And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
I don't know. I don't remember doing it.

## It's about Gregory Jameson. He's dead.
Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!

## Oh my god, what happened?
Yes... I... we had dinner.

## Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment?
No, it was our first date.

## A kiss? Did you have sex with him?
No, I said it was our first date.

## Yes, Jennifer told me. What does that have to do with me?
Seems you were the last to see Carlton alive. And the last to see Gregory alive.

## What makes you think I was the last one?
No. We left the restaurant, and... and I felt sick... so... so I took a cab home. Alone.

## You got a dog?
No, I have a cat.

## How big?
No he's not. He's a courier. He picks up packages from the airport.

## I wonder how Frida and Carlton are getting along?
Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky.

## I'm supposed to put up with a fuckin' cat I'm allergic to cause your friend's got PMS?
It's so bad she becomes a werewolf.

## You have some weird friends. What does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?
Don't be stupid George. Obviously if she's a werewolf, she can't be around a cat. She might eat it and besides, cats are afraid of wolves.

## Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do?
Take some allergy medicine.

## How the hell is that your business?
We're just trying to figure out what happened.

## You want her sheets?
We can just take this pillowcase.

## Why would you want to be a cop?
I don't know, I guess the outfits are cool. And I want a big gun.

## Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?
You kiddin'? They try to get ME drunk.

## That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick.

## Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag?
I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.

## Maybe. What about all those hairs they found on his body?
Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.

## Madonna's in Penthouse?
Back in the '80's. You didn't see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush.

## And you think I'm sick?
He was found nearly ripped to shreds in Central Park.

## This one walk you home too?
Seems he's stolen money from them. He's desperate and our only lead.

## You think mafia hit?
Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.

## What are you talking about?
I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...

## What makes her think that?
She says she's on the rag every time I get called in to investigate a murder.

## Did we get those DNA tests back?
Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.

## What kind of animal?
I need something to keep me awake.

## What of?
The city. I need to get to the ocean.

## Mnunn. Cold lately. That night, couple weeks ago. That was real cold. Remember that?
Maybe ten minutes... Thats strange.

## What's he doing here?
Says he is the man's doctor... You know...

## The other one?
His wife.

## Jesus. Small world. Where's the photographer?
No one available.

## How will we interrogate them?
Well, sir... I don't know exactly.

## Doctor! What brings you here?
Just visiting my patient.

## Really? And how is his state of mind?
He's seriously disturbed...

## You seem a little edgy. Everything okay?
Yes, of course. Everything's fine...

## Loose ends?
I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor. Tall fellow. No hair. Rather pale skin...

## What is this place?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector. Have patience - you'll see for yourself.

## Was that for real down there?
I'm afraid so.

## Why are you wearing that thing on your face?
Germs, sir. These places are full of them.

## What about Thompson, sir? Wasnt this his case?
Shes getting better, thanks. She...

## Why do you want to speak to him?
A hunch. He might be able to...

## Ill be the judge of that. Anything else?
Actually, I was wondering, sir, if you could let me have a few uniforms, to follow up for me...

## Lost something?
Yes. That's right. He's ill - he needs expert help.

## How could you have been so stupid?
Yes, sir.

## Dont ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?
Patricia Crenshaw.

## How can I submit this?
Im sorry...

## Do you wash your hands before you type things?
Why, yes.

## Who is it?
Won't say. Says he must talk to you.

## Yes, sir. Everything?
All the important stuff. Wrap it up for me.

## Where are we going?
Shut-up.

## Why give yourself up?
I - ah - couldn't think of anything else to do. I thought maybe you know something... I'm scared.

## That was a pretty good escape act at the station. How did you do that?
I woke up in a subway. I don't know how I got there.

## Who?
I don't know who they are.

## Why are they after you?
Don't know that either.

## Don't know much, do you?
They didn't have faces.

## What?
Go on.

## Where do you think this goes?
It sure isn't the fun-fair.

## This ocean business... I know where I can find a map. I need to go back to the station. Where will you be?
Can't let you in... sorry.

## What? Who has?
Is that your idea of a joke? I don't remember... Take my advice, Bumstead. Get off this case. Now.

## What is going on?
Jesus! We have to get you to a doctor...

## But... How long has this been happening?
Such a joker! Like your father.

## You see it?
Yes.

## Where does it lead?
It must be a closet or something.

## A book of delusions. Anything else?
But I...

## I see. Then who is after you? What sins have you committed?
Just let me sit here for a moment? Ill go soon, and stop bothering you.

## You know something about me?
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it? Is there nothing you remember? Not even a detail? You must try.

## Waves... A beach. A woman whispering. That's all. I need to stay awake. Do you have any pills?
What does she say? The woman.

## Bad dreams?
Yes.

## You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
That's right. I am your doctor.

## Known me for long?
Well...

## Did she drown? The woman you told me about?
Not exactly. She was found in a canal, disembowelled. Throat cut. Blood drained. The body wrapped in a bed-sheet.

## Can I get my life back?
Maybe.

## What are you doing?
I have to go...

## Why?
Don't ask stupid questions. Look at it.

## What happened to you?
I'm... being... punished.

## What is it?
We are... living in their dreams...

## How do you know I'm innocent?
Of course you are. You couldn't do those terrible things. Come home with me - maybe things will make sense then...

## I can't do that. It's dangerous. What about my parents? Do you know where I can find them?
They're dead, John.

## Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...

## Is this dangerous or anything?
No more than the usual.

## Uh -- I don't know. Sometimes it's just like a barter thing... Is this legal?
First Lady...

## You're kidding?
It happens. This is where you'll be sleeping.

## What's with her?
Don't worry about it.

## Oh, sure. Remember the convention speech?
Dave...

## What the hell is this ?
The Washington Post.

## Well, maybe I am. But you're fired.
Choices?

## ... what?
I said you're fired. Go on -- get outta here.

## Oh... I'm fired?
Yeah.

## Fine?
Fine.

## Where's the girl?
TilT we figure something out.

## Like how?
Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...

## Mild stroke?
Yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.

## Up and around? Soon?
Soon.

## Do you know how many different kinds of laws we've broken?
You mean we get `Dave' to nominate you as Vice President.

## What about containment, Alan?
I got the nurses for fifty grand a piece and the doctors for a hundred. The older one wanted head of the CDC.

## Is that everybody?
Duane's guys, but he's got them under control.

## What do you mean, he's clean?
I mean I've checked everything. Women. Liquor... Finances. I went all the way back to his high school race for student body president.

## What about the wife?
Clean.

## Are you out of your mind?
Uh, let me get back to you...

## You scheduled a whole day with the First Lady?
Alan, we still have to control this guy...

## How long have you been waiting to pass that thing?
Three years.

## What's with the cameras?
Hundredth cabinet meeting. I thought it was a nice touch.

## Do we have anything on the budget today?
I don't think so.

## What are you gonna do?
I'm going to kill him.

## Well, I didn't mean it, Alan. Why the fuck would I want to save a homeless shelter?
He was only doing his job.

## What do you mean by that?
Just what you think I mean.

## Are you threatening me?
Sort of... Yeah.

## So you want to go swimming?
Dave -- I'm working.

## Oh yeah... Me, too. You want to get dinner later?
I was gonna do something with Joan.

## I am the government.
And who's gonna find out?

## I gotta tell ya, Dave. I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up. Who does these books?
I'm not sure.

## I gotta tell ya, Dave. I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up. Who does these books?
I'm not sure.

## I'm not surprised. Can we save anywhere?
Well, yeah. But you gotta start making some choices.

## You know -- priorities. Remember when you couldn't get your car fixed `cause you wanted to get that piano?
You could buy it on payments.

## So what do we do?
Well, there's lots of places where I think you can save, but I'm not the one who's ....... I mean, I'm not the one who's not the Pres...

## You sure? A Coke or a Perrier or something?
Oh yeah... 1'm fine...

## We're not upset with you, Dave. We think you did a terrific job. Don't we?
In fact, we think you did such a good job, we'd like to extend things a little bit.

## Extend things?
Extend them. C'mere for a second.

## What happened?
Well, it's... It's sort of an... an `incident' really...

## Will he be alright?
Oh, yeah... probably...

## Really? Crazy?
You know, on an empty road where you know it's safe and nobody's around...

## Well, let's say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital. You'd do it then for sure wouldn't you?
Well... I gues I would... Yeah.

## In the car?
In the car.

## The teleprompter. Is it hooked up?
I don't think so.

## What?
That's at a press conference. Otherwise he just puts `em right out there.

## Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
She hardly ever sees him and it'll be so fast, she won't have a chance to tell.

## What?
Quick. Gimme a quarter.

## We vetoed that?
Dave, the budget's a very complicated thing. Even I don't understand it sometimes. Now occasionally we have to make some cuts and...

## What do you mean you made it all up?
We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir boy.

## Dave'?
She knows.

## COMMERCE And it's proving quite effective...
COMMERCE Yes, Mr. President?

## Does it make the cars any better?
COMMERCE No, sir. It's more of a perceptual issue.

## Perceptual?
COMMERCE Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.

## Why?
COMMERCE Well... to shore up product identification and preserve market share.

## So we're spending forty-seven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they've already bought?
COMMERCE Yes, but I wouldn't...

## What are they?
Fertility beads.

## Mr. President, may I speak frankly with you?
Certainly.

## What do you mean?
I just fired Bob Alexander.

## What?
You know. Your first campaign.

## Really?
My wife was my campaign manager. We had a two thousand dollar budget.

## How'd you get started?
Oh... Kinda the same way.

## You're not?
No.

## What?
On occasion for security purposes, to double for the President at the Secret Service hires someone public functions and exposed situations.

## Really?
We'd like to hire you.

## So, how long have they been like that - - you know, him and the First Lady?
I can't say.

## So you just protect the President the whole time? That's your whole job?
Yeah.

## You got a gun?
Of course.

## You ever use it?
No.

## What about it?
Well, is that really true? I mean, would you really get killed just to save his life.

## Didn't mean to bum you out.
You mean with you and everything?

## That's okay. You alright down here by yourself?
Oh, sure. Don't worry about it.

## Who?
The Vice-President...

## You sure you don't want a lift back home?
No thanks. It's not that far.

## What are you staring at?
Uh...

## Since when do you care about the homeless?
I care about the homeless.

## I don't understand.
... How could I what?

## Oh... Yeah.
What's wrong with a magic trick?

## Mind if I sit down?
No.

## I mean, what is it? Another Secretary? A jaunt to the Bahamas with Some 'campaign worker.' Where is he?
I don't know.

## You're leaving?
I'm not the First Lady, anymore. I shouldn't be here.

## Where are you going?
Home.

## Where's home?
Oh, they didn't brief you on that? How sloppy of them.

## You1re leaving, too?
I never wanted to hurt anybody. In fact... I even thought I was helping.

## How were you gonna get home?
I don't know. I hadn't thought it out that far.

## You sure this goes somewhere?
Truman used it all the time.

## What?
It's just so strange...

## What?
I'm starving. There's got to be something open around here.

## You mean when I'm not running the country?
Yes.

## Yeah. Is that funny?
It's just more than anybody else does around here.

## It was okay?
It was inspirational.

## What?
I can't.

## What's wrong?
Looks like we're not going to get a chance to get much done.

## You really believe that?
Yeah. And it's better than not believing it Their faces are inches apart.

## What?
Hi.

## ) Thought I needed a little change. You like it?
It's nice.

## So this is it?
... Not exactly the Oval Office.

## The Monroe?
Uh, yes, sir. The Monroe Hotel...

## Did you get someone to double for me there, out front?
We're working on it.

## What about the intro?
It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.

## Who's this priest I'm thanking?
Father Mclntire. He blessed you at the inauguration.

## Oh yeah. Did you take care of later on?
All set.

## I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island?
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him.

## I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your headquarters? On the mainland?
The mainland...is dead...a dead place...nobody there...

## Then why did you come here?
To look...look for a place...a place to live in...an empty place...a... new...place...

## How did you know we were on this island? Do others know? Will others come?
Nooooo. Believe me. There are no others...no rebels...nobody...it's over...it's ooooo....

## What is it?
I dunno. Landing pad for a helicopter? I dunno.

## What do we do? Let'em know we're here....or what?
Let's just....wait a minute. Get a better look.

## It can't be. Are we truly in hell?
Come on.

## What is it?
The tunnel.

## Well, you managed ta make it here jus' in time fer this case, didn't ya?
Miss Henried, I think you better...

## Tonight?
We think there are other cities surviving. We think maybe Detroit... there's some signalling out of Philly.

## Gasparilla?
He was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.

## Governor Dickerson? Of Florida?
We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns.

## What is it if it ain't a curse?
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.

## What?
Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was shouting! Datura Metel!

## What is it?
It's...he was...one who came to the island with me.

## How long do we have to watch him?
Forever, darlin'. Forever. 'Til he turns ta dust and blows away on the wind.

## It's alright. I'm a friend. I need help and so do you. What's a safe place to talk?
Ain't no place safe.

## The hospital?
Maybe.

## He's my contact for Chrissake! There's two crates. Can you get me into the hospital?
There ya go. Complete with air canisters...little motors.

## I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
I got some fuel comin' out and, I hope, some automatic rifles.

## This stuff really works? No shit?
Quicker than gas. And it smells a lot prettier. It usually don't kill but it puts ya under fer a good night's sleep.

## Hey. Slow down. What is it?
No, sir.

## What'dya get?
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.

## So what the hell's Mutt been up to?
Actually I don't really know Mutt.

## You know how many demerits we're talking?
So don't goddam come! Please.

## Do they go to Henley Hall?
Hell no, I'm not afraid of them just, if we get caught with them, we're dead.

## Why doesn't he let you do what you want?
Yeah! Tell him off! It couldn't get any worse.

## Thigh man? Mr. \"K\" was a hell raiser.
How was dinner?

## What is the Dead Poets Society?
I don't know. I don't get it.

## But why?
God, I can't take it anymore! If I don't have Chris, I'll kill myself.

## How'd it go? Did you read it to her?
Yep.

## What do you mean you don't know?
How about a trig study group? Right after dinner.

## Garden?
Well...

## I couldn't stop myself.
I thought I'd be spontaneous. I mean, that's the point of this whole thing, isn't it?

## But what if they see it, Nuwanda?
So much the better.

## You're siding with Mr. Nolan?! What about carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that?
Yes sir.

## It's such a strange name! Won't you tell us what it means?
I told you, that's a secret.

## Yeah! Don't you guys miss having girls here?
That's right, it's Nuwanda.

## What?
Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body. You're not like that.

## I'm not?
Doing fine, sir.

## Your family move into that new house, Mr. Overstreet?
No one, sir. It was just me. I did the proofing so I inserted my article in place of Rob Crane's.

## Do you still insist that this was your idea and your idea alone?
Yes... sir.

## Hey, I heard you went to summer school?
Yeah, chemistry. My father thought I should get ahead.

## What's his specialty, brown-nosing?
Sure.

## Who's in?
I'm in.

## Charlie, That was great! Where did you learn to play like that?
My parents made me take clarinet but I hated it. The sax is more sonorous.

## Nuwanda, what is going on?
Nothing, unless you object to having girls here.

## Where'd you find them?
They were walking along the fence past the soccer field. Said they were curious about the school so I invited them to the meeting.

## You what?! How did you do that?
I'm one of the proofers. I slipped the article in.

## What happened? Were you kicked out?
No.

## What happened?
I'm supposed to turn everybody in, apologize to the school and all will be forgiven.

## What are you going to do? - Charlie?
Damn it, Neil, the name is Nuwanda.

## What good will that do?
Maybe he'll have some advice. Maybe he'll even talk to your father.

## Stop what?
Chet...

## That's your sister school, right?
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.

## Oh, hi. I'm glad you made it. Did you bring anybody?
No.

## If Chet sees you, he'll kill you, don't you know that?
You can't be in here.

## Oh, but it's fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me?
I didn't mean to make a fool of you.

## Just like that?! You just knew?
Of course just like that. That's how you always know when it's right.

## And if it so happens that you're wrong? If it just so happens that I could care less About you?
Then you wouldn't be here warning me about Chet.

## Chet? To a play? Are you kidding?
Then come with me.

## We thought it would be good to break old habits, sir.
What is that?

## What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?
They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.

## Mr. Overstreet, I suggest you worry less about breaking old habits and more about developing good study habits. Do you understand?
Yes sir.

## Gather ye rosebuds while ye may. The Latin term for that sentiment is \"Carpe Diem.\" Anyone know what that means?
Carpe Diem... seize the day.

## Very good, Mr._?
Meeks.

## The hoi polloi. Doesn't it mean the herd?
Seize the day while you're young, see that you make use of your time. Why does the poet write these lines?

## \"We went to the woods because we wanted to suck all the marrow out of life.\" Anybody want to read?
This was my first classroom, John, did you know that? My first desk.

## Courtyard?
Boys marching. Clapping in unison.

## John, the curriculum here is set. It's proven. It works. If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?
I always thought education was learning to think for yourself.

## A yawp?
A barbaric yawp.

## Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain My Captain. What was the Dead Poets Society?
Ah, so you boy's have been snooping.

## Gosh, they don't give you much room around here, do they?
Maybe they don't want worldly things distracting me from my teaching.

## Give your father the benefit of the doubt. Talk to him. Let him see who you are.
Why do you do it? I mean, with all this seize-the-day business, I'd have thought you'd be out seeing the world or something?

## Isn't there an easier way?
Not if you're going to stay true to yourself.

## What did your father say? Did you talk to him?
Yeah.

## Really? You told your father what you told me? You let him see your passion for acting?
You have another choice.

## All right! What'd she say?
I don't know.

## All right. Jesus, what are you gonna do?
What I have to do. Screw the annual.

## Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?
She's practically engaged to Chet Danburry. Mr. Mondo Jocko himself.

## Screw it all. I don't give a damn about any of it.
But she's in love with, the moron son of my father's best friend. What would the dead poets say about that?

## Any group pictures in the annual?
Nothing. No mention of it.

## I will not be disputed in public, do you understand me?
Father, I wasn't disputing you.

## You know what this means to your mother, don't you?
Yes sir.

## Where is this cave he's talking about?
Beyond the stream. I think I know.

## Forget it, Pitts, you're coming. Meeks, your grades hurting too?
Look at this.

## What is it?
The god of the cave.

## Why'd you leave Balincrest?
My brother went here.

## So what do you think of my father?
I'll take him over mine.

## What?
Nothing.

## Want to come to the study group?
Thanks but I'd better do history.

## What is it then?
I... I just don't want to come.

## I don't want to read.
But why? Don't you understand what Keating is saying? Don't you want to do something about it?

## What?
Keating said everybody took turns reading. I don't want to do it.

## God, you really have a problem, don't you? How can it hurt you to read? I mean isn't that what this is all about? Expressing yourself?
I've found it.

## Found what?
What I want to do! Right now. What is really inside of me.

## A Midsummer Night's Dream. What is it?
A play, dummy.

## I know that. What's it got to do with you?
They're putting it on at Henley Hall. See, open try-outs.

## Neil, how are you gonna be in a play if your father won't let you?
First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.

## Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
As far as I'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of it.

## By the way, there's a meeting this afternoon. You coming?
I guess.

## What is that supposed to mean?
Being in the club means being stirred up by things. You look about as stirred up as a cesspool.

## You want me out... is that what you're saying?
No, I want you in. But being in means you gotta do something. Not just say you're in.

## Why not? Don't you think you could be?
Er No.

## No? What do you mean 'no'?
No.

## Neil, how are you gonna do this?
Sssh. That's what I'm taking care of. They need a letter of permission.

## From you?
From my father and Nolan.

## Todd, what's the matter?
It's my birthday.

## It is? Happy Birthday. You get anything?
This is your desk set. I don't get it.

## Here, villain, draw and ready. where art thou?
You should come to rehearsals. I know they need people to work the lights and stuff.

## Visit from my father.
Chicken shit. Where were we?

## Do you have to quit the play?
I don't know.

## You the Captain?
Yes.

## How do we get out of here?
We have to make it to the third deck...

## Who are you?
He's the owner...

## All right, be cool, everybody, nice and slow, no sudden moves.
Why don't you want a message sent?

## I'll kill you!! I'll fucking kill you!! I'll do it! I'll do it! I'm not playin' around here!
Who?

## What the hell are you talking about?
Us...I'm talking about us... We're the fish.

## And what? These things are octopusses?
I don't know what these things are ...all I know is...

## Fok Yu and Fok Yu Two...are we strolling down memory lane for any particular reason?
No, it just struck me as odd...I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.

## And where is our point of arrival?
Right here...middle of nowhere...and the answer to your question is yes.

## The one you came up to ask...are we on schedule?
Take note Mr. Mason...this is why you hire a professional...No whining. No excuses.

## Who asked any?
He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract.

## How soon can we get up and running?
We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly.

## Where are my men?
I told you...

## Who gives a shit about aft?
That's where my boat's moored.

## You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do?
The thieves.

## Then who are you?
I'm their ride.

## What are you people talking about?
He's with them.

## Jesus Christ lady...
I was born in a City housing project in the Bronx OK? It's not in the cards that I die on a luxury cruise ship...now which way up?

## What are those things?
I don't know...

## Hey! Hey! Where are you going?
...there's got to be a way to access out back there...

## But what makes you think there aren't more of those...things...back there?
Nothing...you want to come, come... you don't...

## Seen a lot of islands?
Quite a few.

## Anti social?
Self sufficient...

## With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?
Hey! I didn't have to come back.

## Oh yeah? What kind is that?
The \"come back\" kind.

## How do you know that?
Takes one to know one.

## You're saying they can think?
I'm saying they're calling the shots...

## What's the matter?
The quiet...

## What is it?
A meat locker.

## So how do you get from the Bronx to the South China sea?
You quit high school, lie about your age, join the navy, and next thing you know, four years are up and you need a way to make a living...

## What?
You know what kind of force it took to rip open the bow of this ship? A million little things like this...

## Oh my god! Oh my god! How do we do it? How do we get there?
Not like him.

## If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island?
Jet ski...there's one left up there.

## How about noise? Can you get noise? We don't need speed, just noise, right?
Right...

## You want ME to go up there?
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.

## And what if I run into one of those things?
I don't mean to drop in unannounced ...you ready...

## You don't take orders very well, do you?
I don't take orders at all.

## Where's you friend?
He's not coming...

## ...Jagger was here...I was here...
So?

## That's it? That's all you give a shit about?
I think he knows that Joey.

## What? You don't think I can have a normal life?
Joey...look at me...

## Joey... Which way's aft?
That way.

## Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
For juice, I gotta rebuild. That's not fast.

## Seafood salad. You ever operate a jet ski?
I've never seen you so congenial with a mamber of the opposite sex... The two of you got a nice patter going...got a nice rapport...

## How does an island sound to you?
Man, don't go up there...

## You're beautiful what you're jealous, you know that, Joey?
Was it the water in my eyes or were you guys about to...

## You tell it straight or I pull the trigger. Who are you?
A passenger...

## Where are you going?
Nowhere...

## You want some too?
You know what my goal is? Before I die I want to make love to a woman from every country on earth.

## What the hell does that mean?
Like Mamooli's country...

## What was that?
Nothing.

## What is it man?
I'm looking...

## Why don't you help us so we can get done faster so we can get the hell out of here?
What's there to think about? That THING back there...

## She fucked you?
She fucked me.

## She fucked you?
John,we're going huntin'.

## Who's going?
We're all going.

## Nick's going?
Nick, Vince, Albert and John.

## No women?
Here's to huntin'.

## Where the hell were you? We were all set -- beer, broads. Right? Am I right?
Yeah.

## Fuckin' guy's been shooting slants, Albert! I mean, what do you think?

He's real bad, Nick.

## Well, where the hell is he!!! I mean what are we all sitting here for!!! WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

## Where? Where is he?
Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital and they're fixing him up.

## You talk to him?
Oh, sure... Twice a day.

## What hospital is he in? Where?
No.

## You are frightened, no?
See, I'm going home.

## But of course! Please make yourself comfortable. Perhaps you would enjoy some fresh caviar, or une petite glace, or --?
No. None of that.

## Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?
Yeah.

## Where is he?
Linda, yeah.

## How was huntin'?
Oh. Fine.

## Get anything?
No.

## Those fuckin' niggers. This time I'm going to eat balls!... You ever try 'em?
Naw.

## You know a guy named Merle?
Merle? That's who we're looking for. Merle.

## Yeah?
Sure! I got eight hundred potatoes says he goes one more... He retired, you know.

## Yeah?
Inside, Vince.

## Nick! Hey, Nick! Boy! Boy oh boy! Are you okay? You're okay, huh?
Rough. We didn't have to do it, John.

## No. How's Angela? How's she taking it?
Not so good.

## No?
Worse since she talked to him.

## Why?... What do you mean?... Why?
Nick, she won't say why.

## You Biederman?
Biederman, yes.

## I got you on this flight, Biederman. Is that right?
Please! Please mister, please! This is vital I go to Saigon. This is very important. Most important.

## Linda, what's the matter?
Okay.

## Sit with Linda, man, will ya?... Give her a beer. Would you like a beer?
Sure.

## What kind of beer would you like?
That was nothing. That wasn't anything.

## How's the trailer?
Great. Fine... Once or twice it did fall off the blocks. I don't know what that's from.

## Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?
Naw, it's... I mean...

## Does this... I mean, how does this job work out?
Oh, it's great. Fine.

## Nick?
Right here.

## What are you doing?
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.

## What?
I see you're going hunting.

## Linda... Honey, what's wrong?
I don't know.

## I... No. You do this for money?
Up north.

## Ah yes. Of course... So few survive. La creme de la creme... How did you obtain release?
Playing.

## Playing?
We... Three bullets.

## How extremely clever. That is really most extraordinaire... Allow me please to introduce myself. I am Armand... And you are?
Nick.

## Merle?
Right here.

## Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
Right here.

## Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
Right.

## Huh?
I just wait. For this... It's what I wait for... I wait all year.

## You do?
Yeah.

## You think about it?
Yeah.

## The shot?
Fucking A.

## What do you think about?
I'll tell you something, Nick. I wouldn't hunt with anyone but you. I won't hunt with a yo-yo.

## Yo-yo! Who's a yo-yo?
You're a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You're a fucking maniac!

## What'd he say?
Pow.

## Pow?
Pow.

## From Nam?
Yeah.

## Huh?
Tomorrow I go with Vince.

## Hunt with Vince?
Yeah... I mean so he knows... He doesn't even know.

## What else?
I thought you might be praying.

## Okay, okay! Okay. Okay, you're right... What about Sal?
Forget Sal.

## What do you mean?
I mean forget Sal... Sal can't take it, Nick.

## We gotta play with more bullets.
Forget Sal?

## We what?
We gotta play with more bullets, Nick. It's the only way.

## More bullets in the gun?
Nick!... I thought you went home.

## Fine. She's fine... Merle, what the hell are you doing?
I like it, Nick.

## No.
Merle... Hey, Merle, listen... Why?

## No!!!?
No.

## What do you mean, no?
As soon as you're hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched.

## Oh. You know. How's it with you?
Same. Hey. Same old stuff.

## John Wayne's great... Listen, Sal. Jesus. When are you getting out?
I'm gonna stay here, Nick.

## Sal, we need you. We need you.
What?

## Hey, Nick. How can you need me?
We do, Sal. We do... You're the heart.

## Did you get one?
No.

## Where?
Here. Behind you.

## Merle? ... Merle's alive? How do you know?
I saw him last night. I thought I was dreaming. I thought I was out of my mind.

## Merle gave me this?
Yeah.

## It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this?

## Didn't I ever tell you about Phantom Mary?
No.

## It's all right. Hey, it's all right. We'll be right here, right with you.
Yeah!

## How're you guys... I mean, how've you guys been?
Same old thing. Hey, same like always. Nothing's changed. Albert is getting fat.

## Naw. Uh-huh.
Well, who'd you get married to?

## Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one of those slants?
No.

## Six or eight. And they go wild?
You're full of shit!

## Just like always! Just like it always was! Right, Nick? Am I right?
In the timeless words of Squire Albert...

## Up I would say... What would you say?
Up.

## What'cha got, Bennett?
Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model. I got an artist working on a computer composite now.

## Technothugs?
I can smell it.

## Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
I want this bastard brought down.

## Yeah?
Wade's here.

## What did you say?
I'd think about it.

## My man Dubbs.
Who is it?

## Who are you? What the fuck do you want?
I want to ask you a few questions.

## No, you're not model material. Anything else?
Funny guy.

## What's this?
Fill it out. Standard issue mal- practice insurance. All Cops carry it.

## You son-of-a-bitch. How do you stop it?
We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.

## Got compliments coming outta your ass, don't ya?
Just got the call. Took him from school. Bastard nailed the Vice- Principal and a teacher.

## Where?
I'm wasting time.

## What are you talking about?
You were planning to send me back to the ice house. You set me up.

## What the hell are you talking about?
You have no evidence. Arrest this man.

## Tell Doucet that. What was his rehabilitation training?
Telephone repairman.

## How do I look?
Aces.

## Need help?
I got it. I got it.

## Are you a cop?
Yes.

## Does it drive itself, too?
You have to use the steering wheel to turn. The pedal for gas...

## Got it. Ejection seat?
Lean year for role models.

## No offense, but why'd they partner me with a rookie?
Doucet killed my partner.

## See those guys?
Technothugs.

## How do you know?
Some things never change.

## Wanna come?
My insurance won't cover it.

## Can I ask you something?
Yes.

## Then what goes on in there? What I mean is, what are you thinking about?
Bacon cheeseburgers.

## Give me a break. I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?
Trust me. You don't want to know.

## How then?
You don't follow the bodies, and you don't follow procedure. You do it by instinct. Think like him. Do what has to be dane.

## GCI. TM-1. What language are you talking?
I also PVC'd you. Youngest Officer promoted to Sergeant. Two CMs. Four honor medals...

## Why?
I was set up.

## It doesn't make sense. Who would want to do that to you?
Nothing makes sense when you're a cop.

## Engaged. Plan on doing it this summer. You still married?
Yeah. Least I think so. Twenty- six years this March.

## What's this place?
This is where I found Doucet twenty years ago. Thought maybe he'd come back.

## You need anything else?
I'll be okay.

## I'll have a cup of coffee?
Never use it. Stuff'll kill ya.

## You want to be a good detective?
Yes, sir.

## Wanna try?
No thank you, sir. Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.

## You're not pregnant, are you?
No, sir.

## What else did he get?
Wallet, cash, I.D...

## Kid, you ever been in a high speed chase before?
Simulated one.

## How do I look?
Not too good.

## Sanchez...?
I'm here.

## ...What are you talking about...?
Your girl. Being a cop will be rough on her.

## ...Have you been drinking?
Not yet.

## You okay?
Aaah... Mother of Jesus.

## What is it? Your legs? Hands?
Hospital food.

## What are you doing this for, Sanchez?
If you were set up, I want to find out who did it.

## Says here one of our boys brought him down. You ever heard of a badge named Wade?
Demolition Man.

## What's it mean?
You never want to find out.

## You all right?
Yeah.

## What's your name?
William Simpson. I like Willy.

## Funny. Would you like to buy me a drink?
This little thing says I can't.

## The -- folks or people, what's the difference among friends?
Hey, you! Watch out there -- you're scuffing my Brussels carpet -- Consarn them.

## Who are these people?
They are all friends of mine -- from over the mountain. Welcome! Help yourselves to drinks! Glad you could come! Have a good time.

## That's my business. -- Now, it's all right, Daniel. What did he do?
He lied to me again.

## Lying to you -- Why should I?
You know that you're in my house.

## Hello, Colonel! Want a lift?
Guess there will, if it says so.

## And two unpara-- unparalleled Cir-cass-ian beauties? What is that?
Young man -- you got me there.

## And what about Daniel Webster?
Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.

## Make them go faster, Mr.... ?
Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!

## What's that, sir?
Anybody can see that.

## Granny, when do we move to the new house?
I did not, Grandma.

## Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?
I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me.

## Yes, but what does a farmer do if he don't want to get roped in some more by them loan sharks?
Oh -- you don't have to go to Miser Stevens while I'm around.

## Loan shark -- hey?
Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.

## Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?
That farmers' association -- we were talking about the other day.

## Jabez -- will you join our Grange now?
Why, thank you, Tom. I was going to ask you if you thought I could.

## Never mind. What's your name?
Belle.

## I dunno -- I can't figure it out. I've invited them all. Why don't they come?
Now run along, Daniel.

## Are you plumb crazy, man! What do you think happens? We're buried -- that's all.
What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?

## Huh? -- What's that? Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
Yes, of course, people forgot -- or the men who knew about it died, you know how these things happen.

## Leave your tongue off of that!
What does it mean here -- about my soul?

## My time isn't up yet.
Why, Mr. Stone, you look so worried. Can I be of any service?

## Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone?
I'm through with you.

## Jabez Stone -- did you or did you not sign this document?
That is highly irrelevant to this case, Your Honor.

## But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience. Is this your signature?
You know darn well it is.

## Ten throws -- Mr. Webster?
Ten throws it is.

## You win. Will you ride to the village with me, Mr. Stone?
Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.

## They make plucky women in New England. H'm ... how long have we to wait?
Not long -- now.

## Breakfast ... Ah! ... Come along friends, Ma Stone's a cook this side of heaven.
You were worried, Jabez, weren't you?

## Shall we?
Why -- good morning, Squire.

## Selectman? Selectman of the village? Me?
But -- I was just lucky.

## Well? Don't a politician have to be?
Howdy, Squire! Howdy! Oh -- how do you do, Squire.

## Dan'l Webster is coming to my party.
You really think so?

## Yes -- and that's the reason I wanted to talk with you. You got my invitation?
Yes.

## Now look -- here's a list of the people I invited -- they're all the right kind of people -- or did I miss anybody?
The only one you missed -- is the President.

## You are not so sure that he'll come.
You mean that's all you had me come out here for?

## How much?
You're right, Mary.

## Hold the splint tighter -- it's almost done. Go on reading, Ma. This man, Job, he had troubles, didn't he?
Well, I'll be -- there's a rig, turning in, by the gate.

## It's Tom Sharp and two other fellers -- Oh, glory -- where's my pants?
That's wonderful language. It would move a stone.

## Well -- what are we going to do?
We can still use my butter money.

## Do you think I'm grudging it?
Mary -- it's gone.

## Not all of it?
Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse.

## You always said, the field uphill needs a rest, but if you think --
Jabez -- you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange.

## Mary -- how do you feel?
I'll get the doctor.

## Mary -- what would you do?
Well -- I -- I don't know -- I would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet, but -- really -- I think I would live the same.

## Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
I'd love to.

## What do you think of that, Jabez?
Looks right elegant, Mary.

## You'll never change -- will you?
I am going to lock him up.

## Isn't that your own fault?
My fault? ... Oh, Jabez -- all I want is to be proud of him. He can be such a fine boy, if we show him how to be.

## I don't know, Jabez.
Well -- I am worried about the way you've changed. That was one thing you said you'd never do -- remember?

## Think this room is larger than anything Webster's got at Marshfield? You've been there. What about it, Mary?
It's -- different, Jabez -- that's all.

## Mary! Come back ...
What's the matter with 'em? Why don't they come?

## Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
Oh, Jabez! ... Did you hear, Mr. Webster? -- Now you'll help him, won't you?

## That's right, Ma -- we ain't licked yet. A Stone's never licked till he's dead -- that's what Dad used to say, didn't he, Ma?
I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.

## What's ailing that dog?
Well -- that's comforting! Supper.

## Say, Mary, how is your shoulder?
Well, son, I'm glad to see a Stone come up in the world again.

## Money -- money's a funny thing, ain't it, Ma?
I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son.

## Do you really think that?
I know, Ma, but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways --

## Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?
I say -- it don't matter.

## What a nice -- and kind girl -- Who is she --?
The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.

## So you've made up your mind to go to the party.
What mountain?

## You aren't angry with me?
Ah, fiddlesticks -- you are old enough to know what you are doing.

## What are you looking for, Colonel? What's your name?
Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you.

## Goodness, Mr. Webster, I've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner.
Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?

## Jabez ...
Oh, could you, Mr. Webster ?

## Mr. Webster -- you will help him?
I'll do my best, Mary.

## There is nothing like a good old country breakfast. Where's Ma?
She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you.

## Oh -- it's you again. What do you want?
Why, certainly -- but be careful, Mr. Scratch -- Medford rum has an uncanny habit of kicking back, even with old-timers like yourself.

## Me?
Oh .. not that you ever get drunk! No, indeed! But a kind of overpowering lassitude or, more plainly, a deep and enveloping sleep.

## There, Mr. Webster. All open and above-board and in due and legal form.
Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster! Cup for cup -- what do you say?

## Foreign? And who calls me a foreigner?
Well, I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship.

## You mean -- a jury trial?
Very well. -- You shall have your trial, Mr. Webster. The case is hardly one for an ordinary jury --

## Why don't you?
I can't be honest with them.

## Argyle. Don't you take this stuff?
Do I? I'm sorry. You're gonna have to help me, man. This is my first time driving a limo.

## If your friend is hot to trot...I know a couple of mama bears. ...Or is he married?
Married.

## The girl was off today. Hey, I didn't expect you to sit up front. So, your lady live out here?
The past six months.

## You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?
It's okay, it's okay.

## So, you divorced of what?
She had a good job, it turned into a great career.

## You mean you thought she wouldn't make it out here and she'd come crawling on back, so why bother to pack?
Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.

## How 'bout some Christmas music?
That is Christmas music.

## What is it don't work out that way? Where you gonna stay?
I'll find someplace.

## One of yours?
They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.

## The police...?
John.

## How about his job?
His 'job' is 3000 miles away. Without him, they might let us go...at least we have a chance...

## Where are you going?
I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first... them...or your husband. Hi there.

## Ellis, what have you told them?
You're very perceptive.

## I must have missed 60 Minutes. What are you saying?
The guy upstairs who's fucking things up? I can give him to you.

## Yes...I know about them. The code key is a necessary step in accessing the vault.
See to Heinrich... Now...you can break the code key...?

## Bad for your health anyway.
You want...money? What kind of terrorists are you?

## I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
Actually, I was always partial to Roy Rogers. I really dug those sequined shirts.

## Do you really think you have a chance against us, Mr. Cowboy?
Only if New Jersey counts.

## They invited me to the Xmas party. Who knew?
Better than being caught with your pants down, right? John McClane.

## Bill, you know how to use a handgun?
Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'? Now you are fucked.

## How long?
Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock...that's out of my hands.

## Oh? What idiot put you in charge?
You did. You murdered by Boss. Now... They're looking to me. Personally I'd pass on the jab. I don't enjoy being this close to you.

## No. But I'll have a sofa brought out to you. Good enough?
Good enough. And unless you like is messy, you'd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom.

## Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...?
Gennero. Miss Gennero.

## Nice, but one of us is three hours out of sync. I think it's me. Is there a place I can wash up?
Sure. Follow me.

## What are you doing?
It's a long story. You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you.

## Oh...Where does he live?
Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.

## They would, huh?
So I've heard.

## Can I get you anything? Food? Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
I'm fine. You throw quite a party. I didn't know they had Christmas in Japan.

## How do you know?
I hear you... Partner. And LA's finest are on it, so light 'em if you got 'em.

## Uh, what do I call you?
Roy'.

## I said we'll talk later, Roy. If you're what I think you are you should know when to listen, when to shut up... and when to pray.
I'm here, Roy, but I'm, uh, kind of busy. Let's talk later, okay?

## The plastique I found. Is the building on fire?
No, but it's gonna need one hell of a paint job and a shitload of screen doors. One spotters say you got two with that blast.

## Two? Are you sure?
Hey, I love you. So do a lot of the guys. So hang in there, man. Hang in there.

## You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
Yeah, just trying to handle some year old twinkies. Yucck. What do they put in these things?

## Not yet, the wife in working on our first. You got any kids back on the ranch?
Two. And I'd sure like to see them swinging on the jungle gym with Al junior.

## Al? Al, you there?
I'm here, cowboy.

## Roy? You still with us?
Yeah. But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia. By the way, chalk up two more terrorists.

## Yeah? What's the odds?
You don't want to know.

## Powell? What's going on?
Ask the FBI. They've got the terrorist playbook and they're running it, step by step.

## Roy?
Stand by, Powell. I gotta check something out.

## Dwayne Robinson. Well, what have you learned? What do they want?
The terrorists? Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.

## Then who the hell have you been talking too?
He claims? Powell, has it occured to you he could be one of the terrorists, pulling your chain? Or some kind of nut case who --

## What's going on?
No. I never smile any more.

## Whattaya think, we gonna kill any civilians tonight, Gene?
They jet's comin' out. But don't let 'em off the ground.

## What if we gotta kill a whole lot of people?
Don't let 'em off the ground.

## These seats come out?
Heidi, I'm dying.

## Heidi - why didn't you come down here?
They're not after you, they're after me.

## Jackie - what are you talking about?
Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.

## He says he doesn't know. Why don't you cook whatever's there?
It looks like a whole roast.

## The robbers in the bank. They got guns?
Yeah. A lot of guns.

## Yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay?
Sonny? Don't send me away! I can help you save your soul ...

## How are you doing?
Well... I'm out of the hospital.

## Yeah. You said... I thought you were never getting out?
I never thought I'd get out this way. I'll tell you.

## Oh... huh ... how you feeling?
I'm really shakey.

## I don't know what I'm gonna do... you know. Boy... I'm dying.
Yeah. So how are you?

## What are you talking about?
I'm sorry...

## Where you gonna go?
Who the fuck knows? I think we're gonna go ... we worked it out to Algeria. So, I don't know. So I'll go to Algeria.

## Why you going to Algeria?
Huh ... I don't know. They got Howard Johnson's there. I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for.

## What am I supposed to do?
I don't know... you could have picked a better place.

## So! Sal is with you?
Sal? Yeah... Sal is with me.

## All right. Then what do you want me to say?
Sonny, would you please just tell them... please...

## Where are they now? Just tell me... are they on the phone now?
Yeah.

## That's great. Just terrific. You talk to me with them on the phone, right? That is really smart. And, you don't tell me?
I don't have a choice.

## You don't have a choice?
No! They're standing all around me. Seven thousand fucken cops... all around me.

## Look... who's on the phone?
Look... don't throw that on me.

## Who's on the phone, now? What do you mean... throw it on you? You knew it, right?
Yeah... I knew it. But, what choice do I have? I'm in the hospital; they drag me out of the hospital... bring me down here...

## All right, enough! Who the fuck is on the phone... anyway? Is that you Moretti? You on the phone? Will somebody talk to me?
They won't talk to you.

## Yeah... yeah!
Yeah... huh, thank you. I'm going to go back, Sonny, to the hospital. They're really nice people. They're really trying to help me.

## Do you still want the operation?
Yeah... yeah.

## I can't help it. I can't stop him from anything.
Yeah... see ya in my dreams, huh?

## If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?
He won't listen to anybody. He's been very crazy all summer. Since June he's been trying to kill me.

## You try calling the police?
What good is that? They couldn't stop him. And it'd just make him mad. They don't know him.

## Well, don't you figure you owe to him to get him out of there?
I can't talk to him.

## How is he gonna hurt you on the telephone?
I don't know what to say to him. I can't.

## Who's this?
What a fuckin' comedy! WNEW plays all the hits.

## Okay, you're in there and we're out here. What do we do now?
I told you -- keep away. I don't know what we do now.

## You alone, or you got confederates?
I'm not alone.

## How many you got in there?
I got Sal.

## What do you want to know that for?
Give me a name, any name, just so I got somethin' to call you.

## Sonny-boy, one word?
One word. You won't find it in the phone book.

## Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short?
Call me whatever you want.

## I frisk you?
You frisk me.

## I'd like just some sign I can trust you too, Sonny. I don't want to trust my body out where you could just shoot me. Some sight ... right?
Sure ... like ... I'm not gonna shoot you.

## How about letting the people out of the bank. Why put them in this position?
They're what's keeping me alive. You think you're dealing with an idiot? Talk to me then.

## I want to see my wife. I want you to bring her down here.
What?

## What do you want?
The girl hostages.

## What the fuck do you want?
They were ...

## You tryin' to fuck me?
No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you.

## So, what were they doin'? You're tellin' me you had nothin' to do with that back there?
I swear to God I had nothing to do with it ...

## Well, what were you doin' back there?
It can't happen again ... I'll do everything I can to stop anything I can ...

## There won't be ... there won't be ... What else do you need? How else can we help you?
All right ... I got some hungry people in there ... I want to get some pizza ... some stuff like that ...

## What else?
Cokes, seven-ups ... also some aspirin ...

## Yeah?
We're bringing in your wife...

## Is he all right? Is he all right?
He's all doped up.

## Why didn't you just wait and try to take 'em out there in the street?
We're all set at Kennedy.

## What makes you think you'll be able to control it?
He's totally unstable. He'll make a mistake.

## Do what the gentleman says, Howard.
Eugene, at 3,07, this became Federal. Why don't I take it over now?

## Okay, is the vault open?
I can take care of that.

## What's the matter with you?
Gimme the traveler's checks and the register.

## Where's the back door?
It's locked on the inside. It's through that passageway and to the right.

## Now, you -- what's your name?
Mulvaney...

## Let's go to the back door. How'd that guy get to be a guard?
Well, they go to guard school.

## You got kids?
I got two kids ... and I'd like to see them again.

## Ah, I know! You're being very cooperative. I got no complaint against you whatever; you got bank insurance?
Don't ask me questions. I got connections. You find out who I am, you're cold meat.

## What if I take you with me?
If you take anybody, please take me.

## You're just a nice guy, Mr. Mulvaney. Only don't fuck around with me, you know what I mean?
I don't fool around with you.

## What?
The TV ... they want to talk to you ...

## What now, Sonny?
Wait a minute ... I've been looking at this all wrong ... Let's look at it the other way ...

## Where's the air conditioning?
I don't know.

## Are we going to get the ball rolling?
I'm okay ... I'm okay ...

## Oh, Jesus! You want to be a martyr or a hero or what?
I'll never see them again, Mister Mulvaney.

## You like me?
Sure - we like you.

## Would I hire you?
Yeah.

## Why not?
I don't think so.

## Are you a lawyer?
No. I had some legal training, but...

## What now, Sonny?
Listen, I owe a couple hundred dollars! I don't wanta leave owing anybody anything! A clean slate, a new leaf...

## Everything's all right? You okay?
Yeah, just a cigarette got in a wastebasket.

## You all right?
Little smoke, like a Polish four- alarm fire, is all.

## Yeah. Well, you're okay?
Yeah, thanks for keeping an eye out.

## What about Howard?
I didn't eat any pizza.

## Hey. It's raining.
Ah, Sonny! Good luck, you know?

## How did you know your son was involved?
It was on the TV.

## Did you know he was a homosexual?
No, not until after they killed him.

## Do you remember anything else about Sal?
No, that's all.

## Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
I used to, but I stopped.

## You stopped? Why?
You shouldn't start now.

## For God's sake! As soon as I'm outta this bank robbery, I'm gonna stop ... okay?
Go ahead. Do what you want to do. I hate to see you break a perfect record. You oughta take care of your body.

## My body? What for?
Yes...

## He's gone?
Yeah - it's all right... let's go.

## Goddamn women...
Where's the money?

## What?
... The bodies out the door.

## But do you mean it?
Sal, I'm sorry about this. But we can get outta this thing. There's a way outta this.

## Well, I stalled him for a while. When it comes the time, then we'll work it out. Okay?
But do you mean in? ... But you just told him that if worse comes to worse...

## Dead or alive?
Alive.

## Okay, Sal ... what do we do?
Okay, Sal ... what do we do?

## I figure maybe we can get the FBI to make a deal ...
I figure maybe we can get the FBI to make a deal ...

## What kind of a deal?
Maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ...

## What do you mean? You talkin' about coppin a plea?
What do you mean? You talkin' about coppin a plea?

## We'd kill ourselves.
We'd kill ourselves.

## Does that still go?
They keep sayin' two homosexuals. I'm not a homosexual. I want you to stop them saying that.

## Sal?
They gotta stop sayin' that.

## What'd he say?
He was talkin' about arrangements ... we were talkin' about the TV.

## Hey, Sal ... How you doin'?
Okay.

## Just give me a receipt. Hey, Sal, you okay?
Okay, Sonny.

## There it is, Sal. Sal?
I'm here.

## Okay, when do I get them?
At the airport. We get on the plane, check it out, and if it's all okay we'll send them out. Except one.

## You got guts. You think if Sal and me have cut their throats we're gonna let you out?
I have to see.

## Wait a minute! What the fuck you tryin' to tell me?
What I said. You just sit quiet and we'll handle Sal.

## What's wrong?
The manager, he's diabetic, he's lookin' bad.

## It's my mother. Who needs this shit?
I don't want him.

## Okay. Which one goes?
I ain't eaten all day. I just realized it.

## Okay, who's the head teller here?
I am.

## What's the matter... they never housebroke you?
It's not a joke. I got this terrible fear of being locked in...

## What are you trying to pull?
I forgot she's in here.

## Hey, you okay?
He's got diabetes. He's not a well person.

## Those bastards -- they poisoned the pizza! Sal - you didn't eat any pizza!?
My kids ... Kimmy and Jimmy.

## You did what? Who did you talk to? What for?
Oh my God, mother!

## He was very understanding - you ought to talk to him ... Algeria?
Not now, Mom, please.

## What the hell for? Twenty-five years in the pen?
Maybe...

## Did Pop come down?
No. This really pissed him off, Sonny. He says you're dead. He says he doesn't have a son.

## Doing what?
Robbing a bank.

## What about, ah, non-union occupations?
I'm here to talk to you, Sonny, not ...

## Yeah! We're hot entertainment, right? You got me and Sal on TV ... we're entertainment you sell, right?
You're news, Sonny ...

## How much you have to pay an entertainer to fill this slot?
Newsman, not ...

## Oh yeah? Give up? You ever been in prison?
Of course not ...

## You know what I'm talking about, did you fuck her?
I just charged $12.95 to our room for that movie. Now I'll never know how the story ends.

## What about your toe?
Anything to get the fuck out of dodge.

## What do you think, dumbshit?
Promise me... you won't ever tell Domino.

## What!!?
Okay.

## What?
My armored car business. We just signed a new insurance policy in Nevada. There's a loophole.

## The driver's name was Locus Fender. We know that he was in on the heist. Taryn is now scrawling notes on a pad.
Hello?

## Where is the money?
I don't know.

Nice to see you again, Edna.

## Must you use that awful word?

It's Choco. And he's not my boyfriend. He's a bounty hunter.

## You want to be a bounty hunter. Why does a pretty little thing like you want to be a bounty hunter?
Because I want justice. I want to help put these sleazebags back in jail where they belong. And I want to have a little fun.

## So Ed. What did you do before you became a bounty hunter?
I was a musician.

## Really? Did you play in a band?
Yeah. I played base guitar for Pat Benatar.

Something is going down. Something bad.

## What did he say about the arm?
Many times.

## Do you know where Danang is?
Not really.

## We can't lose focus of Domino's journey, Mark.
They need to get the introduction on camera. Just play along, alright?

It's about turning that shit off and getting the fuck outta my pizzeria.

## How come you ain't got no brothers up?
Ask Sal.

## Sal, how come you ain't got no brothers up on the wall here?
Buggin' Out, I gotta work here.

## You a dumb-ass simple motherfucker. Where did you read that?
Don't worry about it. But when it happens and I'm in my boat and ya black ass is drowning, don't ask me to throw you a lifesaver either.

## What was you saying?
Make it plain.

## How long?
I don't know how he does it.

I know so. He, them, they're not to be trusted.

## So what do you want me to do?
Be on guard. Mookie has Pop conned already, so we have to look out for him.

## Twenty minutes. How come you niggers are so stupid?
Turn it off.

## Couldn't we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood?
Too many pizzerias already there.

## Shaddup! Jade, what can I fix you?

Both of youse--shaddup. This is a place of business.

## Oh my god, are you alright?
Yeah, I think.

## CHING CHONG, What happened to your beautiful Asian accent?
Actually, my name is Cindy, the accent just helps me meet boys.

## Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?
Depends how you define 'new'...

## Yeah. How'd you know?
Four colors? Neato!

## Do you thill want to do an arwticle on me, Jethica?
Yes, you and the whole Special Needs class.

## You did?
Oh Harry, you're so funny. Now I have something that's kind of delicate...

## We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special.
Oh, you want to talk about your delicates?

## Excuse me?
Come over around seven.

## O'clock?
Yeah...

## Would you like something to drink?
Yeah, but I'm buying.

## Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? You had questions?
I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher.

## LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened.

## Po, po, position...? Hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom?
Just down the hall.

## HARRY? Are you okay?
Coming.

## What are you wearing?
Okay.

## Why didn't you tell us your boyfriend was Principal Collins?
What? No! Look.

## Is it true what you said to Captain Rob?
Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...

## Wow, a treasure map! What's the treasure?
It could be anything. You're going to discover a whole new world when you get to school.

## LLOYD, did you ask your parents?
Then a sleep-over is okay by me. Okay boys, eat up.

## No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?
Probably because we've never met.

## Home school? What's that?
I go to school where I live.

## Is that what I think it is?
No, it's a treasure map.

## What?
You're it.

## Don't we want them to talk to us?
No no no no no.

## Well, besides cooties and other medical reasons, they're not in the cool crowd. Which I am, and you want to be. Know what I mean?
No.

## Who's Principal Collins?
The principal.

## Oh, is this your special place?
No, I just usually eat my lunch on the crapper. Saves time. Out with the old, in with the new.

## Can we eat there tomorrow?
Sure, but first we have to find kids special, needy and classy enough to be in Special Needs.

## Got any crazy eights?
Go fish.

## Who's Captain Rob?
Just a guy I hang out with.

## Peg leg?
HARRY.

## You look familiar. Did I have your brother?
No.

## What's with horse-boy, now he's a bright shiny sun?
Don't look directly at him.

## ...and who was Benjamin Franklin again?
The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla.

## Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?
A. Slushee. Don't tell me. Abraham Slushee. Third president of the United States.

## Can he do that?
HARRY, he can and he did. And now it's on like Donkey Kong.

## These are really cold, huh?
That's why you have to drink it fast, trust me.

## Ow... What do you want to do, HARRY?
I don't know. Owwww.

## Sorry. Why are you dressed like a Queen!?
...cause you said...

## What?
Our own special bus.

## Nope. I was right.
How do you know it's for us?

## Wanna bet?
Uh oh. Captain Rob's always been my partner.

## Who's your partner?
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.

## Well... Uh...maybe... jeez, how can I say this... you and I could...perhaps ...maybe...uh... partner up?
You and me? Dream on, desperado.

## Oh yeah, buddy, you're gonna get \"some\".
Sorry about that Harry, first time I've brought a friend up there. You okay?

## Some what?
Come on, Lloyd. You must know someone I can talk to.

## Oh hey Lloyd, why are you here?
Just wanted to see how your doing.

## HARRY, can you hear me?
Yes.

## Do you want me to pet your head?
I bet you want your head scratched.

## What are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
Sure, I like a woman with some meat on her bones.

## Captain Rob came back?
Yeah, he does sound like a rat fink.

## HARRY, would you like to share with the rest of us what's so funny?
You wouldn't get it. Just a private joke between best friends.

## The answer is George Jefferson.
No one knows?
