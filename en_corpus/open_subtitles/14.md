## where are you going?
it's over, dory.

## please?
no one's ever stuck with me for so long before.

## are you all right?
i don't know where i am.

## nemo?
that's a nice name.

## is it your dad or my dad?
it's ok.

## daddy?
oh, thank goodness.

## what?
sea turtles...

## 150?
yep.

## the sea cucumber looks over to the mollusk and says...
sandy plankton?

## with fronds like these, who needs anemones?
hello, nemo.

## who's this?
exchange student.

## did you really do all the things you say you did?
pardon me.

## dad?
you can let go now.

## yes.
where'd the fish go?

## under what circumstances might one become a slave among the mende, of which you claim to belong?
translate.

## and how many men are indebted to you?
i don't think you do see.

## now, he is familiar with the concept.
do these workers own the land they work on?

## when you come down to it, it's all about money, isn't it?
slaves, production, money.

## do your people routinely slaughter their slaves in the manner that you just so vividly described to us?
of course they don't.

## how do you explain that paradox?
i don't understand what you mean.

## because?
not even unusual, regrettably.

## what, if anything, in his account of his ordeal, do you find believable?
his description of the slave fortress, for one thing.

## you've seen it?
no, sir.

## rumour?
reports.

## by \"reports \"you mean of the variety cinque shared with us today?
its existence, sir, has been reported.

## drown hundreds of people?
yes.

## from the tecora?
if you look, there's a notation made on may 10, correcting the number of slaves on board, reducing their number by 50.

## i may need a quill and parchment and a better imagination.
what does that mean?

## a mast and sails, perhaps?
give us... us... free.

## who is he?
i don't know, but everywhere he goes he is followed by the sun.

## what's this?
he could also walk across the sea.

## what did we do?
whatever it was, it was serious enough to kill him for it.

## do you want to see how they killed him?
this is just a story, yamba.

## were they born in africa?
since the answer to that question shall govern every determination of this court, i ask it again.

## were they born in africa?
i believe they were.

## mr president?
senator calhoun is here.

## what president wants to be in office... when it comes crashing down around him?
certainly no court before this one.

## our president, our big, big man, has appealed the decision to our supreme court.
whoa!

## what does that mean?
we have to try the case again.

## you can't translate what?
i can't translate \"should\".

## there's no mende word for \"should\"?
yes, cinque.

## mr tippings, excuse me a moment, please.
what kind of place is this?

## what did cinque say?
he won't talk to you.

## he won't talk to me?
no.

## how's your english coming?
no better than my mende, i suppose.

## cinque, i know this isn't something you necessarily want to think about, but has it occurred to you that i'm all you've got?
because, since my practice has now completely deteriorated, you're all i've got.

## you see how this works?
and and and this, this here, cinque, is for me.

## hmm?
more death threats.

## i should say, should say... former clients, shouldn't i?
there is one more consequence to having no clientele to speak of.

## yes, you understood that word, didn't you?
free.

## is that him?
yes, mr president.

## what?
i was talking about john...

## yes?
cinque has asked me t t to ask you... whether you have thought about the question of jurisdiction.

## that since they took over the ship far out to sea, and since neither spain nor america owns the sea, how is it that the treaty applies?
tell him the treaty recognises no jurisdictional limitations.

## yes?
no.

## now, you understand you're going to the supreme court.
does america have treaties with west africa?

## do you know why?
it is the place where they finally kill us.

## what have they told you?
that you are a chief.

## huh?
and all we have on our side is a rock.

## is he going to help?
he has far many more questions than answers.

## what did he just say?
i i... sorry, i didn't catch it.

## alone?
indeed not.

## do we fear the lower courts, which found for us, missed the truth?
and now would have us disregard truth even as it stands before us, tall and proud as a mountain.

## a court that finds against the africans?
well, i think not.

## we can all see that.
could it be?

## but can we also see as easily that which is equally true?
all men created equal, \"\"inalienable rights, \"\"life, liberty, \"and so on.

## what on earth are we to do with this?
i have a modest suggestion.

## what words did you use to persuade them?
yours.

## what?
senor calderon.

## hmm?
well, there are reasons.

## west indians?
not necessarily.

## scars?
yeah.

## what is he then?
he's a white man.

## your honour...
who be you two gentlemen?

## you wish to make this claim above that of the queen of spain?
where was she, pray, when we was fightin 'the winds, your excellen... uh, honour.

## yoso \"ruiz, and... pedro montes?
pedro montes.

## how do you do, sir?
my name is roger s baldwin, attorney at law.

## real estate?
real estate, inventories and other assets.

## what is it that you do?
well, i own various business... and banks.

## me?
mr tappan.

## i'm required to see him?
no, sir.

## oh, he requests, does he?
yeah.

## where is he?
he's right over there, sir.

## where?
right there, sir.

## how do you do, sir?
an honour to meet you, sir.

## sir?
is there somewhere...

## what?
let go of my arm.

## i said, what season is it?
i don't understand what you mean.

## do you really think van buren cares about the whims of an 11 year old girl who wears a tiara?
i assure you, only one thing occupies his thoughts this time of the year, being all things to all people, which means nothing to no one.

## will you help us, sir?
let go of my arm.

## as an advocate for the abolition of slavery, will you help us?
i'm neither friend nor foe to the abolitionist cause.

## what?
i know you, mr president.

## you're quite the scholar, mr joadson, aren't ya?
quite the historian.

## what are they worth to you?
we're discussing the case, not its expense.

## i'm right, aren't i?
yes.

## \"are they?
yes.

## the what?
it would be against everything i stand for to let this deteriorate into an exercise in legal minutia.

## did christ hire a lawyer to get him off on technicalities?
he went to the cross, nobly.

## you know why?
to make a statement.

## you want to win, don't you?
yes.

## who are they, do you think?
looks like they're going to be sick.

## you want to sit?
sit here in mendeland.

## you want trouble?
cross into our territory again.

## let me show you to sherbroland.
what is this?

## there?
i'm sorry.

## what do you want?
keep talking.

## have you seen this before?
i could kill you with my bare hands before you raise that sword.

## this belongs to you?
no.

## what did he say?
i didn't understand a word.

## do you think he's here to help us?
i don't know.

## is this where you're from?
a fri ca.

## what does he want?
he's an idiot.

## were you born in the west indies?
all three of them are idiots.

## what did he say?
oh, he said, er...

## i cannot overstate... have you figured out who he is?
an advisor of some kind.

## what about him?
the simple cook, a creole...

## and dung scraper?
i have a horrible feeling he talks for us.

## or how about... a polecat and a president?
the spanish government hopes you don't have much more sense than that.

## i thought he was born on a cuban plantation?
perhaps he simply doesn't like you.

## on spanish plantations, slaves choose to live surrounded by their own ways and simple languages.
what, did he learn this on some cuban plantation, this decorative effect?

## stop?
gestures suffice for slaves, as for any other beast of burden.

## is that correct?
i have them.

## you do?
much better than i expected, to be honest.

## how can i explain to you where we're from?
you go.

## now, cuba... is this your home?
i don't think so.

## this is your home, isn't it?
this... is... your home.

## yes?
you came... all the way... from... here.

## what did they want?
to come aboard.

## light...?
light the lamp, mr baldwin.

## are you all right?
yes.

## how, then, can the portuguese tecora... engage in the slave trades in these waters?
there's nothing there.

## what did i do to deserve this?
you took the case, mr baldwin.

## over this?
it's worse than that.

## what could be worse than that?
calhoun believes, and i am not sure i can disagree with him, that this could take us all one long step closer to civil war.

## this?
yes, mr president.

## they can?
but i believe we must go further and remove the judge.

## we can do that?
he could be prevailed upon to recuse himself for various reasons.

## he's catholic?
his grandfather was catholic, which young mr coglin has striven all his days to keep quiet.

## what to do now, eh?
which is why i came here and imposed on you, sir.

## how did that young lawyer take the news?
oh, in stride, sir.

## did he?
oh, yes, sir.

## yeah?
mr president, if it was you handling the case...

## i'm much obliged for your time, sir.
but if it was, sir, huh?

## what is their story?
why, they're, um,... from west africa.

## mr joadson, you're from where originally?
why, georgia, sir.

## is that your story?
no.

## that's your story, isn't it?
you and this young so called lawyer have proven you know what they are.

## right?
seven.

## would you like to count from one to ten?
one to ten in mende.

## what's happened here?
one of them died last night.

## they want to live with it?
they want to bury him.

## the clothes?
and the names.

## how is that possible?
a chief cannot be replaced.

## what's this i hear about a lion?
they say you alone alone, cinque slew the most terrifying beast anyone has ever seen.

## is it not true?
it had killed several people.

## understand?
i'm not a big man.

## that too was an accident?
i hardly think so.

## under what circumstances might one become a slave among the mende, of which you claim to belong?
translate.

## and how many men are indebted to you?
i don't think you do see.

## now, he is familiar with the concept.

how close are you to this other someone else, the one you're trying to protect?

## he's alive?
margaret, you scared the wits out of me.

## how late is rudy's open?
i'm sorry about this part.

## did he say where he was living before he came?
florida.

## how did you...?
anonymous phone tip from some jamaican... guy.

## jamaican?
he said he saw what he thought was a body.

## ls that your brother, sir?
yeah.

## what kind of animal does something like that?
normally, i'd say a bear.

## messy animals, aren't they?
messy.

## so how many insurance companies are there in the united states?
like a billion.

## i busted my ass for liberty capital, all right?
i don't want to quit.

## look, is this a matter of life and death?
because...

## hello?
you're kidding.

## your mom?
a million dollar life policy just checked.

## we don't need a ticket.
on a saturday?

## yeah, can i call you back?
okay.

## don't be late, okay?
you won't even know i'm gone.

## so, what's your line on this?
just what it looks like.

## what are you trying to tell me that mr. barnell chewed off his brother's leg?
well, doesn't it make you the least bit suspicious that maybe...

## chief?
good news, bad news.

## did you happen to see mr. barnell on the news last night?
the police told us what happened.

## how are you folks holding up?
well, my wife is too upset to be here.

## who's out there?
as i said, she's very upset.

## paul?
the door's stuck.

## who fucked with the fucking door?
you see how stressful his has been.

## where you going?
lunch.

## at nine thirty?
yeah.

## which one you figure'd wanna take our friend?
the police say they found raymond's wallet and that's how they tracked you down.

## any idea what he was doing out there?
he'd take walks.

## can i get you a cup of coffee?
no, thank you.

## was he a big hiker?
i'm sorry, i don't follow.

## may i ask why you need to know all this?
just trying to tie up some loose ends, mr. barnell.

## now, you do cover that sort of thing, don't you?
yes, sir, mr. barnell, and it shouldn't take more than a few days.

## what's up?
i took some adavan.

## i'm really, really sick, you know?
i know.

## but maybe it's not what we think it is, you know?
yeah, maybe it's not.

## rememberthat cruise?
i saw you.

## really?
yeah.

## but you have to leave everything up to me, okay?
you leave everything up to me, and you're gonna be okay.

## oh, can you take care of that for me?
i'm kinda working on something here, cam.

## you're not still on the barnell thing, are you?
i went to go see him.

## and?
so, trust me, something's not right.

## no more cam goes to the coffee room and ted disappears forthree hours?
i'il try, yeah.

## and you'il work on your interpersonal skills?
yes.

## are all these yours?
greatest sport on earth.

## tea okay?
oh, yeah, yeah.

## i was just wondering, did you happen to talk to raymond when he got back?
only saw him the once.

## you waved?
he was clearing my driveway.

## was he much of an outdoo rsman or ahiker or...?
i thought it was paul at first.

## have you talked to paul's wife?
now there's a story.

## did you say you thought it was paul that did your driveway?
okay.

## why is god, who is a loving god, capable of such things?
when someone is taken from us at such a young age, we often ourselves why.

## what possible purpose could this serve?
but i believe the apostle paul, writing to the ephesians, said it best when he said \"all things are done according to god's will.

## sweetheart, why don't you go sit in the car and warm up, okay?
okey dokey, smokey.

## they really don't give people a moment's peace, do they?
i called them.

## really?
they wanted to talk to me about raymond, and i thought now would be an appropriate time.

## where's your mommy?
for the cruise ship trade, mostly.

## ls that where they came in?
yeah, through that big hole in the roof.

## how much?
we figure about two hundred grand.

## ted?
maybe we should take a look at the irinventory list first.

## let's just clear it and get going, okay?
i should tell you, we also had some vcrs we were holding for another company.

## you try to rape me, i swear to christ, i'il bite it off.
wanna wrap this up, cam?

## what the hell happened to your face?
jesus, you look like you ran into...

## so what now, you gonna get me smoking from both ends?
i just came here to look around and she started hitting me and yelling at me.

## ls this how you solve our problem?
i didn't have any choice.

## just listen to me, okay?
yeah, listen. lf the fat from your neck hasn't stopped up your ears.

## your place?
no, it's too small.

## with bubbles?
it'd be like a little getaway.

## what the hell are you doing in our house?
mr. barnell.

## you hearthat, gary?
he don't know what we're talking about.

## so how much did you get?
we had a life insurance policy on my brother and we could get... one hundred thousand dollars.

## you stay here?
just for a bit.

## police? ls there something wrong?

## did you happen to see mr. barnell on the news last night?
the police told us what happened.

## how are you folks holding up?
well, my wife is too upset to be here.

## who's out there?
as i said, she's very upset.

## paul?
the door's stuck.

## who fucked with the fucking door?
you see how stressful his has been.

## where you going?
lunch.

## at nine thirty?
yeah.

## which one you figure'd wanna take our friend?
the police say they found raymond's wallet and that's how they tracked you down.

## any idea what he was doing out there?
he'd take walks.

## can i get you a cup of coffee?
no, thank you.

## was he a big hiker?
i'm sorry, i don't follow.

## may i ask why you need to know all this?
just trying to tie up some loose ends, mr. barnell.

## now, you do cover that sort of thing, don't you?
yes, sir, mr. barnell, and it shouldn't take more than a few days.

## what's up?
i took some adavan.

## i'm really, really sick, you know?
i know.

## but maybe it's not what we think it is, you know?
yeah, maybe it's not.

## remember that cruise?
i saw you.

## really?
yeah.

## but you have to leave everything up to me, okay?
you leave everything up to me, and you're gonna be okay.

## oh, can you take care of that for me?
i'm kinda working on something here, cam.

## you're not still on the barnell thing, are you?
i went to go see him.

## and?
so, trust me, something's not right.

## no more cam goes to the coffee room and ted disappears for three hours?
i'il try, yeah.

## and you'il work on your interpersonal skills?
yes.

## are all these yours?
greatest sport on earth.

## tea okay?
oh, yeah, yeah.

## i was just wondering, did you happen to talk to raymond when he got back?
only saw him the once.

## you waved?
he was clearing my driveway.

## was he much of an outdoo rsman or ahiker or...?
i thought it was paul at first.

## have you talked to paul's wife?
now there's a story.

## did you say you thought it was paul that did your driveway?
okay.

## why is god, who is a loving god, capable of such things?
when someone is taken from us at such a young age, we often ourselves why.

## what possible purpose could this serve?
but i believe the apostle paul, writing to the ephesians, said it best when he said \"all things are done according to god's will.

## sweetheart, why don't you go sit in the car and warm up, okay?
okey dokey, smokey.

## they really don't give people a moment's peace, do they?
i called them.

## really?
they wanted to talk to me about raymond, and i thought now would be an appropriate time.

## where's your mommy?
for the cruise ship trade, mostly.

## is that where they came in?
yeah, through that big hole in the roof.

## how much?
we figure about two hundred grand.

## ted?
maybe we should take a look at the irinventory list first.

## let's just clear it and get going, okay?
i should tell you, we also had some vcrs we were holding for another company.

## you try to rape me, i swear to christ, i'il bite it off.
wanna wrap this up, cam?

## what the hell happened to your face?
jesus, you look like you ran into...

## so what now, you gonna get me smoking from both ends?
i just came here to look around and she started hitting me and yelling at me.

## is this how you solve our problem?
i didn't have any choice.

## just listen to me, okay?
yeah, listen.

## your place?
no, it's too small.

## with bubbles?
it'd be like a little getaway.

## what the hell are you doing in our house?
mr. barnell.

## you hear that, gary?
he don't know what we're talking about.

## so how much did you get?
we had a life insurance policy on my brother and we could get... one hundred thousand dollars.

## you stay here?
just for a bit.

## is there something wrong?
hello, brother.

## you know what i love about usa today, other than the bar graphs and the colored pictures?
they got news from every state in the union.

## your money?
there's no money yet.

## what'd you get?
fifty thousand.

## how's she holding up, anyway?
we're having problems.

## you still can't get one past the goalie, huh?
well, it's best not to send a boy to do a man's job.

## so how come you talk like you do?
i mean, cursing all the time.

## really?
congratulations.

## and don't people with tourette's usually twitch and stuff?
i get it.

## you got a spice rack?
next to the stove.

## what's that supposed to mean?
nothing.

## cumin?
there.

## you know what i think?
i think this syndrome is something you read about somewhere and figured...

## what kind of a man threatens a woman with a gun, anyway?
you are so faking it.

## you put that down now, you little bitch, or so help me i'il start yelling so loud, you'il have to shoot me.
is this how you get your kicks, you overcompensating pussy little fart sack?

## a little help here?
i got twinkies.

## you okay?
wait, this is the important part.

## dead guy's got a record?
yeah, he beat some guy up in a bar fight.

## honey?
yeah.

## after we get her back from these guys who grabbed her do you think your wife's gonna be able to keep her pretty little mouth shut?
that'd be a first.

## think about what?
all i'm saying is, sometimes a man has to make problematic decisions.

## is that jailhouse humor?
still...

## mr. barnell, why are you staying out here?
my wife and i we're having a few problems.

## raymond?
no, no, no.

## my tone?
mr. barnell, you are going to jail.

## what happened to your eye?
let's say you just step away from him.

## you all right there, paul?
i'm all right, mrs. wherry.

## you okay?
yeah.

## mr. branch, can i show you something?
i think you would like to see it, too, mr. barnell.

mr. watters.

## really?

## boy, things really worked out for you this time, didn't they?
lots of cash.

## maybe get some hookers?
i love my wife, mr. watters.

## can we level with each other for a moment?
how... how did...

## avis, will you call municipal light and power and tell them i'il be dropping by in a bit?
thank you.

## so what's on your mind, carlos?
i have a situation.

## do you think it's okay to do something kinda bad to someone even though they may do something to someone else that's really bad?
well, you probably shouldn't break the law, if you can help it.

## are you really sure they're gonna do this other thing?
he said some things.

## your wife is an incredibly lucky woman.
how close are you to this other someone else, the one you're trying to protect?

## i know relationships are tough, but you you just do what you gotta do to keep it together, okay?
remember, love is sacrifice.

## okay, so you get tough, all right?
and remember, this call is for entertainment purposes only.

## but call me back and let me know how it goes, okay?
okay.

## can you believe that?
one little case and, boom, you're the flavor of the month.

## i'il call you later, okay?
i won't be here.

## what are you talking about?
i just i think you need to be like this right now, and i'm not in a good space to deal with it.

## so, what?
i just, i don't think we should be like this together.

## how are you today, mr. williams?
i think she'd be fine with you re marrying.

## why do you want me to come?
because if you don't, then... then i'il have to stay.

## mr. williams?
you know, she's totally cool with it.

## see this?
this has all the symptoms of that tourette's thing... and you don't have half of them.

## and?

## i can talk about anything?
yes.

## i assume you have our friend?

i don't know.

## can we take this table?
thanks.

## you really think i'm ready for it?

i can if you like.

## you got it?
ok, hey, everybody, that's lunch.

## hey, are you gonnajoin us?

## how are you?
good.

## you're certainly a natural for the character.

## why would you say that?
you've said it a hundred times.

## you see me like that, don't you?
i'm asking.

i'm wired.

## shall we go out to dinner and celebrate?
tonight's cassie's party.

the silk one is sexier, but this one's elegant.

## you think the silk one's sexier?
so maybe i should wear this.

## fat?
melinda, everyone should be so fat.

## doesn't she?
yeah.

## plus an empty stomach with pills?
vodka's not fattening.

## how did i wind up desperate?
because that's what i am, laurel.

## no?
no.

## why don't you get laurel pregnant?
then you wouldn't need to make arrangements.

## how's our matchmaking going?
they seem to be hitting it off well.

## didn't i tell you?
the great thing about hiking is you're free.

## i've tried to explain it all to emily, including the whole religious aspect, but what the hell?
she's four.

## would you excuse me?
laurel, you know this one.

## are your eyes misting over?
this song, it's meaningful to me.

## well, aren't those the same tears?
yeah.

## why do things that start off so promisingly always have a way of ending up in the dump?
not for everyone.

## is that really your name?
yes, it is.

## is that what you wanna be another verdi or puccini?
i don't kid myself, you know, but, yeah.

## and you?
i don't write opera, but my life has been one.

## how?
well, your eyes, your voice.

## i gotta go back and play, but could we have lunch, you know, or dinner?
you can certainly have my number, if that's what you're asking.

## laurel?
i dated a laurel.

## his opera was a big success at yale and they're doing the other one where?
at the santa fe opera house.

## what's tomorrow?
well, then, i'il call you the day after.

## what happened with you and the swell dentist?
he was very, very sweet.

## you meet a stranger, and in a sudden rush, you're thinking to yourself, \"could i live in barcelona?
be careful.

## what were you thinking?
i love it at this time of year.

## you know, it's really sexy, isn't it?

## hey, do you have any tequila?
i make the world's most potent margarita.

## here, can i help you?
very good.

## god, he's incredible, isn't he?
it'd be great for melinda if things worked out.

## can we just not discuss it?
and, frankly, i thought you acted like a clown.

## now, can i talk to you for a minute?
and try not to get upset.

## you wanna spend more time in the hamptons whether i go with you or not?
i told you steve walsh is gonna co produce my film.

## why not?
steve wants a name.

## what about moe flanders?
you'd be a natural.

## there's a tick in my leg.
flanders?

## where's greg?
he's a dentist.

## ok?
but try not to panic.

## and you would be totally cool if you had a live insect crawling around under your skin?
i wouldn't enjoy it, but i wouldn't panic.

i want to want to live.

## well, why didn't you tell me?
i'm angry and disgusted.

## i mean, christ, can you blame them?
thank you for the emotional support.

## you all right?
you seem a little glum.

## what happened?
it was the producer.

## so, what are you gonna do?
i don't know if i should feel sorry for myself or shop to blot out my depression.

## with you?
sure.

## you remembered?

## do i have time to change?
you look fine.

## it's beautiful, isn't it?

## is that you?
no.

## would you excuse me for a minute?
yeah, go ahead.

## you sat down and pressed the keyboard, and i thought, \"who is this lovely creature with the melancholy touch on the keyboard?
then i saw your wedding ring, and i thought, you know, story of my life.

## is that the story of your life?
well, it's the main chapters.

## where were you?
i had some late meetings at school.

## and you're sure?
yes.

## and you flirted back?
yes.

## am i gossiped about?
god, that poor girl.

## how does melinda feel?
i haven't been able to tell her that.

## you don't know if she feels the same?
no, i think she does.

## well, why can't you just tell her it's not working any more?
i don't wanna hurt her.

## how wise is it to get involved with a woman with melinda's track record?
that's why i'm convinced i'm in love with her, because there's no logical reason to be.

## you sure?
yeah.

## how you doin '?
the deco pin there.

## how much is that?
that's $150.

## could you giftwrap that for me?
yes, of course.

## but what makes you think that something's going on?
i thought it was my paranoia.

## who was here?
i don't know.

## you slept with someone here?
leave me alone.

## what does that mean?
you'd love to call it quits now your eye's on someone else.

## what?
you throw yourself at melinda's boyfriend.

## can i get you anything?
no, i just hope that you'il be sending some of your clients to me when i get more established, you know.

## did i tell you that my mother... my mother... my mother was a very gifted interior decorator?
she was very talented.

she's gorgeous.

## are you talking politically or in the bedroom?
i was talking politically.

## look, can i level with you?
in the past few months of my marriage i really didn't sleep with my wife.

## my place?
yes, by all means.

## so you're not gonna hold the fact that we have conflicting viewpoints on the direction america should take against me?
i mean, i'd hate to get all worked up and then we find we differ on a tax cut.

## what do you think?
so much dancing.

## do you mind sleeping on cotton sheets?
i know you posed for playboy on satin.

## should i dim the lights?
maybe a little jazz.

## do you like jazz?
i can't bear it.

## what?
stacey...

## what are you doing here?
my god.

## for what?
i was jealous.

## jealous of what?
well...

## is she here?
i heard lovemaking talk.

## you were dreaming about her?
i was dreaming of you, actually.

## why were you dreaming about me?
i dreamt i was making love to you.

melinda...

## couldn't you tell i've been in love with you for a long time?

## is everybody going to phil dorfman's funeral next week?
he dropped dead of a heart attack.

## well, how can it be a romantic, funny world if you can't trust your own cardiogram?
i wanna be cremated.

## or after your death?
let's change the subject.

## what's happening?
we are being attacked.

## i know that, but by who?
balloons.

## from fire?
i didn't see them coming.

## yes?
i have to say goodbye now.

## can you reach it?
yes, i can.

## yes?
i'm coming with you.

## xev?
kai, you fly, i'il help xev.

## xev, is that you?
it is xev.

## xev, xev?
i don't get it.

## where?
kai can't be killed, he's already dead.

## correct?
my prince thinks of everything.

## so, we have you, and stanley and your dead man are out of the picture, isn't that excellent?
wonderful.

## don't you have a mind of your own?
oooo...

## am i beautiful?
the most.

## witty?
the sharpest.

## do you love me?
completely.

## would you die for me?
now the game will become more interesting.

## a defeat?
for them.

## what?
rise above all the others.

## her?
no.

## don't you want to rescue xev?
well, yeah kai, but we gotta get some help first.

## ok, what do you suggest then?
engage the other balloons in battle, to save xev now on our own.

## but what but they're all around us, how can we attack them all?
we will not have to attack them.

## what are we gonna do?
whatever we can.

## did they hit us?
not where it matters.

## would you care for a drink?
very well.

## well what can we do?
we can wait.

## wait for what?
for them to make a mistake.

## that's our entire plan?
yes.

## yeah, well what if they don't make a mistake?
then they will succeed and we will fail.

## and i will sink to the centre of this planet.
what does that mean?

## why is it that i do all the pumping and you do all the standing around?
i will pump if you request, but then i will not be able to stop darts.

## did they get the balloon?
not yet.

## why do you do this?
i tempt those who can be tempted, and i punish those who deserve to be punished.

## what is wrong with that?
and i also punish some who have done nothing wrong, who slip through the cracks but then, no system is perfect.

## your childhood, xev of b3k?
no.

## so what do we do?
we wait.

## what is the correct answer?
xev of b3k always flatter your man.

## do you remember that?
it's all a blur.

## so?
no.

## should we fire everything at them now?
firing everything at them will have no effect on the dead man.

## what was that?
we wait for him to make a mistake.

## listen kai, why don't you just, you know, do the assassination thing with your brace and get this over with?
i would, if my brace were fully functional, but it is not.

## what, what's the deal?
the ten seconds were up, so i cut the cord like you said.

## why don't we just crash, down in the water?
in that case, i would be fine, but you and xev would become very easy targets.

## release the stays?
yes, we must release the stays which suspend the gondola from the balloon now.

## look.
how can they get any higher?

## shall i release the mainstay?
yes.

## how can we make it to the lexx?
we will have to be very lucky.

## what weight?
nearly.

## what are you doing?
i have to release the mainstay from up here or else i will go down with the gondola.

## is that clear enough for you?
no.

## well what, what now?
look, there.

## you're not actually suggesting that i let go and throw myself down there, and if i'm incredibly lucky land on prince's balloon, are ya?
no.

## well how?
no no no no.

## your brace isn't working right, remember?
hopefully, you will still be close enough.

## a moth?
we don't have time.

## do these mothbreeders ever stop?
i must build more moths.

## are you one of the mothbreeders who were taken to duketown?
i must build more moths.

## me again.
can you understand that, even a little?

## how did you get here?
i died.

## why?
i want to be with you when you die.

## what makes you think that i'm going to die?
you're on the surface of the planet fire, the sun's up you cannot last the hour.

## and you?
oh, i will also die.

## do you know what a cluster lizard is?
not really.

## how does that matter?
you will see.

## when?
in less than an hour.

## how are you going?
fine, thank you.

## why aren't you dying?
i'm very good with heat.

## how is it that you're not dying?
i'm not all human.

## can you still find whatever memory you want with your hand, like you did before?
yes.

## do you still feel anything for me?
a little.

## hey, look, look, do you see it?
ohhh... la.

## a rooster?

## just 'cause you're having a bad day... is it really necessary to dump on everyone else?
i'il tell you who i am.

## i'm a man?
i don't understand.

## uh, it's not exactly what i had planned, but i'm human... and that's nothing to shake your tail at.
how could i be a man?

## and who are you, mister... and why are you all dressed up like scott leadready ll?
uh, no time to explain, strange little boy...

## what'il you give me if i do?
um, all i've got is this, uh... slimy old dog chew toy and a shiny new nickel.

## how did you do that?
oh, come on.

## what was i so afraid of all these years?

oh, hey, hey, wait a minute.

## anna is very special, okay?
i'm sorry that you found out about it this way.

## why is it between you and me?
because i love her.

## what?
yeah, it came as quite a shock to her too, believe me.

## you're in love with her?
no one seems to have picked up on this.

## you're telling me that i should have been sensitive to the possibility... that a catholic priest had a crush on my secret girlfriend.
why did you have to go and hone in on the first woman i've ever had any real romantic feeling for?

## so what?
you know how much i care about her, and you could have guessed it would end up this way.

## what does that mean?
you're always trying to have these casual flings and relationships... and it never works because the women always fall in love with you...

## why?
you could have had a fling with anybody, jake.

## why did you have to pull anna into your bed?
i didn't pull her into my bed.

## why?
because now i can retire.

bye.

## what did anything happen between you?
not really.

## you're not gonna tell me what to do here, are you?
no.

## no, i'm definitely, definitely still mad, you know?
okay i hope you didn't think you were just gonna stroll over here... after a couple of weeks and find me in a good mood or something.

## yeah, well, what do you expect, you know?
i mean i mean, you should have just told me.

## well, uh, i wanna talk, you know?
i i've got all these things on my mind.

## what?
i wanted to say that i think i handled things really badly and i'm sorry.

## you're my best friend, and would you please forgive me?
that was very simple and direct.

## i i'm very sorry i didn't get to see you two together, you know?
i think that would have made me really happy in some weird way.

## so, have you talked to her?
no.

## you serious?
uh huh.

## what happened?
hi.

## you don't have to say anything, okay?
just listen to me.

always.

## you'il keep it secret?
lf i have to.

## absolutely nothing?

## ls that why he's been looking at all my private papers?
oh, no.

## still, you are the canal, aren't you?
you sit at ernie delgado's right hand.

## where?
up there.

## tell me, how did harry win your heart?
i was raised in the canal...... around military types and engineers like my father...... and i had never met anyone like harry.

## did he have to get arthur braithwaite's permission?
he called him in london.

## did he fly over for the funeral?
arthur forbade it.

## so the two of you have lived happily ever after ever since?
yeah, until you came along.

## running wild...... just for the badness?
never.

## and did you?
yeah.

## what did you and andy find to talk about?
you, mostly.

## bit of a boring topic, wasn't it?
you're a very surprising person, harry pendel.

## after all these years?

## do you understand?
okay, lou.

## what?
make me laugh.

## what?
letting go.

## shit.
what romance?

## yes?
yeah.

## what?
it's a bit of a bad time, actually.

## i didn't know what she knew, did l?
well, i'm sure you handled it like a master.

## look hey, i had to think on my feet, didn't l?
all right.

## you know where that is, don't you?
oh, good.

## what warrants dragging me out of the saddle on a sunday night, eh?

## you and marta?
you and mickie.

## why would they think that?
maybe you know, harry.

## and they came to you?
big chinese guy.

## what did they do to you?
nothing.

## what information?
about the two of you.

## what are you going to do?
sort it out.

## why else would they call themselves silent?
they're a life force, not an embassy.

## so why should we support them, henry?
because if we don't, someone else will.

## do you think personally, this abraxas is...... presidential material?
scotty.

## how much?
the sort of money you boys leave under the plate, elliot.

## how much?
twenty million dollars.

## elliot, may i say a couple of words, please?
i'm only a rookie at heart.

## yes?
sir.

## asked for 20 and guess what?
spin me one of your stories.

## how could you fuck that faceless half breed?
no, no.

## marta?
i've gotta go.

## so it's marta?
all this time, under my nose.

## best left to us humble planners and plodders, eh?
it's fine in principle, scotty.

## wouldn't you say, ambassador?
you know, for quite a while i was skeptical...... about this extraordinarily silent opposition.

## might i offer myself as a go between, so to speak...... to verify andy's dispersal of these funds?
kind of you to offer, ambassador.

## we have a lot to catch up on, eh?
whiskey till the small hours in the privacy of your abode...... is indicated for osnard and luxmore, i believe.

## andrew, i take it you have a secure safe in your apartment?
absolutely, sir.

## you are getting out, aren't you?
possibly.

## who told you that?
you did, just now in the meeting.

## what are you talking about?
i think you're the wickedest human being i've ever met.

## how about a farewell fuck?
here in the office.

## how much is your duty worth?
two million.

## what's that, uncle benny?
the truth, harry.

## esmeralda?
you're not imposing on me in the least.

## who the devil's that?
buchan 2.

## at this time of night?
i don't speak spanish, andy.

## what about the bags?
i'il guard them with my life.

## what is all this bullshit about abraxas and delgado?
don't worry.

## where's harry?
harry's okay.

## what have you gotten harry into?
harry got himself into this with his own ludicrous stories.

## he was just looking for a good enough excuse.
when?

## shall i close his eyes?
you must go now, harry.

## harry, my man, where have you been?
louisa was here.

## so we have to stop all this, you hear?
mickie knew nothing about it.

## setback?
on the contrary.

## now, tell me...... did you manage to resolve that buchan 2 situation?
i got the distinct impression she was in a state ofhigh anxiety.

## hello, is anybody there?
i must talk to the ambassador.

## how soon can you be operational?
give me four hours, sir.

## that fast?
my rapid response units are on full alert, sir.

## i'm sorry, but aren't you that tailor fellow?
you're rather upset.

## that some deranged tailor johnny told us it was all a joke?
nevertheless.

## darling, what?
i need to talk to ernesto.

## will you vouch for me, my credentials?
i need to get on a plane.

## you wish for this man to be included?
i've never seen him before.

## could this be the beginning of a beautiful friendship?
i think it desperately unlikely.

## why?
i don't know.

## all those lies about the president and delgado?
oh, yes, the lies.

## i never did work in savile row, did l?
not as such.

## why didn't you just tell me from the start?
because i fell in love with you, my princess.

## where were you?
oh, sarah.

## what do i want you to do?
what you always do.

## can we have pancakes?
yeah.

## breakfast?
well, there's two ways we can deal with this one, my dear.

## i should have cut that branch, but i got greedy.
ready?

## why do you ask me that?
when i get close to you, you edge away.

## how am i supposed to show you what i do if i ain't allow to touch you?
you tried to kiss me.

## why do you find me so repugnant?
i don't find you repugnant.

## what?
chuck, i've treated you unfairly.

## you've really been alone up here, haven't you?
you haven't had anyone to comfort you and i should ask you for forgiveness.

## still friends?
sorry...

## were you asleep?
no.

## do you want me to leave?
no, i was just resting.

## you can see through it all, can't you?
i'il tell you, i'm gonna be asleep in two minutes.

## what if i don't want you to go to sleep?
i don't think you have a choice tonight.

## jason, what are you doing here?
that's wrong.

## how's that for dividing the words?
this is not a good day.

## what's going on?
i can be very bad.

## why?
because i've been mean lately.

## i should hit you?
i'm not gonna do that.

## it's good having ma on your side, right?
it'd be pretty serious if she turned against you.

## maybe i should go stand in the corner and be ashamed?
i don't care...

## the fbl?
they were most interested in hearing what i'd seen in the past six months, anything related to that wanted poster.

## what did you tell them?
well, i thought i'd seen something in the woods recently.

## why would i wanna run away, chuck?
i wouldn't try to holler, either.

## why would i wanna do that?
she's at my place.

## is she busy?
not anymore.

## who?
you hit jason.

## how could you do such a thing?
i know it sounds implausible, but he was asking for it.

## sleeping at night?
martha saw a certain tom edison jr.

## oh, no?
we all saw you take his hand to the picnic.

## maybe that wasn't flirting?
yes...

## what's the matter?
nothing.

## are the police on canyon road again?
no.

## it's funny you should mention canyon road, though... right, martha?
she was just there this morning.

## do you know that spot, martha?
yes i do.

## and did you stop there to enjoy the view this morning?
it's harvest time, you know, in the orchard after all.

## what do you want with my husband?
i don't want anything with your husband or anybody.

## what about tom and the hand holding at the picnic?
that's different.

## what?
remember how happy you were, when i...

## when you what?
when i taught your children about the doctrine of stoicism and they finally understood it.

## have you got that?
but as the porcelain pulverized on the floor it was as if it were human tissue disintegrating.

## from whom?
from dad.

## absolutely.
grace, where've you been?

## i shouldn't be ashamed wanting you, should i?
it's nothing to be ashamed of.

## at twelve o'clock?
yes.

## afraid you are gonna loose them?
grace, ben's hauling apples today so we won't be loading glasses.

## where have you been?
harvest is the holiest time of the year.

## does it not sound like something you could have said?
i'il be down in a minute, chuck.

## is something wrong?
yeah.

## do you mind moving?
try moving.

## may i go now?
i have to figure out how i'm going to get into my house.

## or is that part of the punishment, having to sleep outdoors?
no, no no grace.

## you did what?
first they suspected me, but then i convinced them that it was you, since you were the one using the medicine closet.

## why?
because i'm here to do the thinking for you.

## what do you mean?
i mean, by showing them some trust.

## what will i say?
everything.

## everything?
yeah, the truth.

## are you for us or against us?
liz is right.

## so how do we do it, tom?
i agree, tom.

## your plan didn't work out very well, did it?
you'il think of another one.

## wouldn't it be worth compromising, just one of your ideals just a little to ease my pain?
everybody in this town has had your body, but me.

## i trust you... but maybe you don't trust yourself?
perhaps you've been tempted, you've been tempted to join the others and force me.

## but why had nobody roused her?
nobody had hammered furiously at her door.

## or even killed?
it was quite unlike dogville to restrain its indignation at any point.

## perhaps things had turned out well after all?
good morning, mrs. henson.

## oh... good morning?
i would have come earlier.

## good morning miss grace?
good morning...

## how are you this morning?
i overslept.

## why didn't you come back and tell me?
i did, but you were asleep.

## i know it does, doesn't it?
the people of this town they surprise me again and again.

## guess where i got the inspiration?
but i haven't come up with a name for the town yet.

## why not just call it dogville?
wouldn't work.

## hey, do you want me to read it to you?
if there is any love in it, it comes from you...

## would you be offended, if i said no?
no.

## where had these ominous words come from?
darkness was falling as grace made her way home from work that evening.

## tom?
hi, grace.

## can i ask you something?
yeah, anything.

## you couldn't bring yourself to throw it away, could you?
the number he gave you that night.

## where is she?
secured by this very key.

## where is she?
okay.

## what's your opinion on the subject?
maybe you have none.

## who did that?
billy, put your hand up, put your hand up.

## if you don't want to kill me, then why did you come?
our last conversation, the one in which you told me what it was you didn't like about me never really concluded, as you ran away.

## that's why you showed up?
and you call me stubborn.

## you're sure you're not here to force me to go back and become like you?
if i thought there was a chance of forcing you, but of course that will never happen.

## what is it, the thing... the thing that you don't like about me?
it was a word you used that provoked me.

## that's what you came here to say?
i'm not the one passing judgment, daddy.

## a deprived childhood and a homicide really isn't necessarily a homicide, right?
the only thing you can blame is circumstances.

## so why shouldn't we forgive them?
dogs can be taught many useful things, but not if we forgive them every time they obey their own nature.

## i'm arrogant because i forgive them?
my god...

## can't you see how condescending you are when you say that?
i can not think of anything more arrogant than that.

## why?
no no no...

## does every human being need to be accountable for their action?
of course they do.

## if you say so, grace.
and without my daughter, i suppose?

## do they love you?
grace had already thought for a long time.

## would she not, in all honesty, have done the same as chuck and vera and ben and mrs. henson and tom and all these people in their houses?
grace paused.

## why not?
so that would mean that i'd also take on the immediate responsibilities at once.

## can we just shoot him now?
let me talk to him.

## a man can't really be blamed for being scared now, can he?
no.

## wouldn't you say?
not now, tom.

## something else, honey?
there is a family with kids... do the kids first and make the mother watch.

## do you need a wrap?
i'm fine.

## you want the curtains opened?
you don't need them anymore.

## what do you think?
i think we should open them.

## do you think that i can allow myself to use it as an inspiration in my writing?

## i'il only teach this once.

## is it this one, dad?
you're all wet.

## can you play that, squirt?

## what is so bad about that?
throughout my life, i just wanted to be like an angel for god, do something where i could be of some help.

## they should change every week.
what's up, nigga?

## how could reagan live in a white house, which has a lot of rooms, and there be homelessness?
and he's talking about helping.

## why can't he take people off the street and put them in his white house?
then he'il have people from the streets to help him with his ideas.

## what is that?
we need protection too.

## are you rolling?
i'm most like my mom because i'm arrogant.

## it's like you've got the vietnam war, right?

i don't believe in anti semitism.

## what's the price on this?
i'm not gonna bite.

## you know what they used to make here?
locomotives.

## beating swords into ploughshares?
that wouldn't be a bad lead.

be my guest.

## it's not like there's a lot of cheap housing around for vets, is there?
no, i suppose there isn't.

## art should only ever reflect the eternal values and the natural laws, especially these days.
but life can be quite abstract at times, wouldn't you agree?

## what are you, some kind of intellectual wet fart?
but this is... 10, no, 100 steps backwards.

## futurists?
yes, ltalians.

## grosz?
yes he did, grenadier guards, i think.

are you pissed off?.

## about the right to strike?
no, about your arm.

## you were gonna be a painter, right?
you're a funny one.

## well?
i think it's good, but i think you could go even deeper.

## does any of what i'm saying resonate?
i suppose what i'm trying to say is you have to go as deep as you possibly can.

## so, if art as an object is dead, why is everything so expensive?
otherwise nobody would buy it.

## friend of yours?
it's a study for a work called \"the cultural consumptive.

## would you like to learn how to speak in public?
we're offering a course to certain people.

## what kind of course?

## will she fall to the left or to the right?
i think that depends largely on the army, sir.

## may we count on you?

## why?
because they guard the purity of their blood.

so's their russian better than their german, actually.

## you know what they say in spain, don't you?
no, i don't.

## what did you think of my speech?
let's just say if you were to put the same amount of energy into your art as you do your speaking, you may have something going.

## where'd you get the sunglasses?
progg and fromm.

## can i get another coffee?
strong.

## so you're an anti semite?
on the contrary, i admire the jews.

## really?

## what?
the purity of the blood.

## ls your father jewish?
yes, he is.

## your own hero nietzsche said anti semitism is the ideology of those who feel cheated.
why not ask whether she's a german?

## how do you know nietzsche's my hero?
you've obviously skimmed his ideas.

## are you gonna smoke another cigarette?
you just put one out.

## now where is my instinct, my secret instinct for self preservation, i ask you?
i've heard these theories all my life.

## and why are you making those appalling speeches for the army?
i'm just keeping my hand in it.

## keeping your hand in what?
the army is paying my expenses.

## how are you, sweetheart?
i think the \"peace \"is a travesty.

## where do you find time to paint?
mensch, use your head.

## ls that some clever way of saying i have poor technique?
try not to be one of those people who finds a slight in any compliment.

## what do you mean, what am i doing?
you told me i had a show.

## how are you going to \"move it \"if it's not up?
am i in your studio looking over your shoulder?.

## can we take it one step at a time?
listen, rothman, i've lost four years.

## can you do that?
cause that's what you got to do.

## you do think i'm talented, don't you?
one morning, i wish you'd just say, \"good morning.

## your children in good health, i trust?
you're such a bourgeois.

## yes, but could you paint that?
of course i could.

## could you do that?
could you be so voluptuous with yourself?.

## hm mm?
i think so.

## why aren't you on board?
i don't know.

## really?
that sounds progressive.

## what has this got to do with modern art?
nothing, i just like it here.

## why don't you set them free?
that'd be a great art project.

## hullo, midgets.
are you on the spike?

## what are you doing, dad?
ln the world upside down, what would we be doing now?.

## ln the world upside down?
let's see.

## i'd loathe you beyond reason, wouldn't l?

hitler.

## are you ready?

## darling, that wasn't paulie's cowboy hat, was it?
what a masquerade he puts on.

## there weren't any of the men there, were there?
no, no.

## the other night?
my disaster?.

## or was it just rubbish?
yes, what did you think?.

## what did it remind you of, if anything?
it reminded me perhaps perhaps, of a particularly disgusting and depraved dream of ypres.

## what was that you said, erich?
i said yes, i know what you said.

## shall i ask you to spell it?
well, this was fun but duty calls and i must mind the store.

## we forgive you for a lot, don't we?
forgive and forget, turn the other way where others wouldn't.

## rothman.
nicht, erich?

## how's my career going?
slow.

## who are those gentlemen?
guttersnipes.

## do you?
i'il just have to take your word for that.

## girls?
yes, hitler, girls.

## so there were parts of it you liked?
i know you're more of a patriot than i am.

## where'd you come up with the idea of the toys?
my son.

## the future?
i think all my work's based on the future.

## do you see fame, money, beautiful lovers?
i see myself teaching.

## how do you see the future?
look inside my pocket.

## would you die for the mother in law land?
you're a menace, rothman.

## he's a futurist.
are you saying all art should be political?

## doesn't he sort of remind you of marinetti?
no, no.

## what are you doing with this man?
he's the most horrible creature.

don't get too close to your charity cases.

## may l?
i think it's expensive.

fine.

## ls that a fur bath?
yes.

some designs.

## this is some old new future world, isn't it?
yes.

## you wouldn't show it, would you?
yes.

he can't give up the other cells ifhe doesn't know where they are.

## how long before he breaks, sharon?
well, at this rate, too long.

## what about it, sharon?
won't work.

## electric shock?
the neurotransmitters just shut down.

## water?
palestinian authorities... producing good intel with water.

## what areyou talking about?
the time has come for one man to suffer in order to save hundreds oflives.

## how about public executions, huh?
because ifwe torture him, general... we do that, and everything that we have bled and fought and died for is over, and they've won.

## areyou?
it was devereaux who took the sheik in the first place.

## our government operates as one coherent entity?
everybody, you and me, we all wanted that sheik's head on a plate.

## so, now what do we do?
there is this growing feeling in certain circles that we ought tojust let the sheik go set him free.

## i mean, why should i trust her?
ask her.

you said theywere being slaughtered.

## doing what exactly?
i told you.

## how much do they cost?
it costs lots and lots.

## were you?
there's granddad.

## do you like her nice new shoes and coat?
mommy's gone.

## she's your wife, and you don't know, do you?
i always said this would end in tears.

## ls it the bastard i saw her with in the pub?
your language is appalling.

## where did she meet him? ln the pub?
no, you're the one who spends all his time there.

## yeah?
i never raised a hand in anger to her once, though she gave me just cause for it.

## you want some of this?
it's very nice.

## why not?
you must be starving.

## the society for prevention of cruelty to children?
that's correct.

## how's that any business of yours?
i'm here to help you.

## do you have an appointment?
i don't need an appointment to see my own daughter.

## you've been drinking, haven't you?
i can smell it off your breath.

## who is this gobshite?
this \"gobshite \"is the minister for education.

## how can we get her consent when she's disappeared?
even her pudding faced old mother's got no address.

## what kind of mother would do that?
the law still requires her consent... no matter how irresponsibly she may have behaved.

## ls it?
yeats.

## you'il have another one?
i will.

## aren't we all fond of a drink?
that's right, henry.

## you can't hold that against a man, can you?
that lad of yours is going through hell.

## worse than drinking to forget?
no.

## it's interesting, isn't it?
i think it's very interesting.

## ls that a fact?
it's true.

## you know anyone who's suitable?
it's not a housekeeper you need.

## you know what your problem is?
you think all you have to do is smile with that cheeky twinkle... and everything will be grand.

## i've got a lot on my mind.
you like my cheeky twinkle, then?

## how do you know about that?
because the tickets fell out of your coat.

## who could that be, i wonder?
i knew you were up to something.

## what business is it of yours?
because i don't want to have to visit you in prison.

## has anybody ever told you you're a fine woman?
lots of men.

## what?
give me the ferry tickets.

## where are they?
here you go.

## i just think, you know, you and l do you really think i'd kiss you now?
it'd be like kissing a soggy beer mat.

a client, sir?

## do you think you can cancel appointments and treat people like dirt?
mr. doyle i wasn't talking to you, yank.

## your being sorry isn't gonna get my kids back, now, is it?
i'm sure the yank here is having great fun... seeing what a lot of bloody spineless jellyfish we've got over here.

## or are you just another heartless, gutless bastard?
congratulations.

## who?
me.

## how come you can work over here if you're a yank?
actually, i'm lrish.

## does my being a yank bother you?
not at all.

## we'il do our best?
we're in this together, my friend.

## do you think i'il take this on with any other solicitor?
we have no chance.

## what possible chance do you think you have?
you and mr....

## decorator?
master tradesman, to you.

## shall we?
by the way, minister... your paintwork's shite.

## you know?
i thought you were an expert.

## can't you read some books?
it's not quite as simple as that.

## remember?
the real character.

## would that be him?
gentlemen, i'm flattered by your attentions, but i retired two years ago.

## you see that photo there?
i was at that game.

## you really think it's hopeless?
this case is what i used to call \"a real st. jude.

## why st. jude?
because st. jude is the patron saint of hopeless cases.

## so, it went well, then?
it went like a dream.

## you didn't attack a nun, then?
i did not.

## what do we do now?
we wait.

## hugh canning?
but he's a sports commentator.

## what is it?
eileen, come here.

## what's going on?
desmond doyle, a painter and decorator from fatima mansions, dublin...

## what do we do now?
you should smarten yourself up.

## new shoes?
yes.

## mr. barron, you're representing the petitioner, desmond doyle?
yes, my lord.

## judge mclaughlin?
this is hugh canning, the man who broke the doyle story... covering this sensational new development.

## ls desmond doyle here?
he's sitting over there, in the booth.

## are you all right, son?
no, i'm feeling terrible.

## did you play rugby yourself, nick?
no, i understand it's kind of a neanderthal version of american football.

## ls that what you think?
hut, hut.

## so, anyway... why have i invited you to this sacred turf?
i was kind of wondering that.

## they thought i was a hero, but you know something?
i envied that man so much.

## but how, tom?
there is no right of appeal.

## the supreme court?
we can't go there with this.

## has anyone ever successfully challenged the law on these grounds?
no.

## who knows?
but i've seen games won by teams without any hope at all.

## fair enough.
and he's got new reasons for being hopeful, haven't you desmond?

## doesn't he look handsome when he smartens himself up?
he's learning.

## and you'il be taking on some pretty top people?
yeah.

## desmond?
i love my children.

## has a date been set for the trial?
not yet.

## ferris the ferret?
yes.

## o'leary, how did you know?
let's say i knew he was hungry for a win.

## desmond?
the readers of the irish times have voted you the man of the year.

## how do you feel about that?
i'm honored.

## who was second?
the pope.

## how's it going with bernadette, then?
great.

## what did she say?
she said she'd think about it.

## really?
yeah.

## what did she say?
she said she'd think about it.

## sister, why don't you cut my hair?
you've cut everybody else's.

## why should that make a difference?
i don't think that i should be treated special just because my daddy's getting famous.

## yes, and didn't he tell you to let me go home?
you didn't take a blind bit of notice.

## and who will explain it to sister theresa if she gets cross?
you, sister.

## nervous?
i'm only trying to make legal history... by doing something that's never been done before, and if i fail, i'm unemployable.

## ls this all right?
it's fine.

## ls that correct?
it is.

## yes, but the grounds for our action now are fundamentally different, is that not so?
i suppose it is.

## pardon?
your job, sir.

## who appointed you?
objection, your lordship.

## as minister for education, you are a government appointee, are you not?
of course i am.

## what is the document on which the lrish government's authority... and therefore your authority, rests?
the lrish constitution.

## have you read it recently?
objection, your lordship.

## would it be fair to say that, minister?
we are waiting for your response.

## he shouted at me, \"where is my daughter?
he yelled at the top of his voice.

## and what did you say to him, sister?
i asked him if he had an appointment.

## and what did he say?
he grabbed me by the throat and almost choked the life out of me.

## and what did he do then, sister?
i told him where the girl was and he ran upstairs... repeating his threats as he did so.

## did you report this deplorable incident to anyone?
yes, i phoned the police.

## have i messed it up for us all, then?
you may have.

## i hope that was the only such incident?
of course it was.

## haven't you heard the phrase, \"as sober as a judge\"?
so, you see, your lordship...

## wouldn't any father have done what i did?
evelyn's face was all battered and bruised.

## how can you, as a single father and as a catholic... possibly claim to bring up your children without a mother?
there is absolutely no precedent for it... in the religion in which you allegedly believe.

## mr. doyle?
there is....

## what are you saying?
the fundamental building block of our faith is not the holy family... it's the holy trinity.

## doesn't the holy bible say,\"... faith, hope and love... \"but the greatest of these is love\"?
i've given up the drink.

## don't you like it?
it's lovely, pet.

## lsn't that correct?
yes, sir, she did.

## and why was that?
because my face was all swollen and black and blue.

## you didn't say otherwise, did you?
no.

## let me ask you one last time... do you remember falling in the corridor and hitting your face on the stairs?
no, i didn't fall on the stairs.

## why on earth would the good sister hit you?
because i said she shouldn't belt annette for getting her catechism wrong.

## how areyou feeling?

i don't think this isjust ordinary diesel oil, scully.

## i know i know how it sounds.
krycek?

## we show a talent for these g man activities.
is anybody not looking for krycek?

## you mean ifl want somebody whacked on the knee with a lead pipe?
i've been expecting you.

## you had business there?
yes.

## who else is looking for it?

bastian, we each have responsibilities.

don't worry about it.

## what can i do for you?
they run maybe 300, 370....

## excuse me...... but would it be all right if i joined you this evening?
you see, i've been traveling all day.

## is he a nutcase?
no, he's a rock biter.

## did the lake dry up?
no.

## a hole?
a hole would be something.

## so, it's not just in our part of fantasia?
maybe, it's already everywhere.

## what can we do?
my people are sending me to the ivory tower, to the empress, for help.

## what are we waiting for?
yes.

## can i carry you?
don't worry.

## is he a nutcase?
it was not you we sent for.

## if you really are the atreyu we sent for...... you would be willing to go on a quest?
yes, of course.

## what kind of a quest?
to find a cure for the empress...... and to save our world.

## any chance of success?
i do not know.

## when do i begin?
now.

## is it time to go already?
i know what you want.

## what's wrong?
come on, boy.

## what's the matter?
i understand.

## are you morla, the ancient one?
not that it matters, but yes.

## do you recognize this?
well...... we haven't seen...... the auryn in a long time.

## is there someone else here, too?
we haven't spoken to anyone else...... for thousands of years.

## did you know the empress is ill?
not that it matters, but yes.

## don't you care?
we don't even care...... whether or not we care.

## do you have a cold?
no.

## you know how to help the empress, don't you?
not that it matters...... but yes.

## die?
that, at least, would be something.

## how can i get there?
you can't.

## leaving so soon?
i was just going to....

## i was trying to sneak away?
yes.

## for breakfast?
never.

## how did you know that?
you were unconscious.

## could you get around...... and scratch behind my right ear?
i can never quite reach it.

## here?
that's so good.

## so, little fellow, you're on your way to the southern oracle?
yes.

## you know how to get there?
sure.

## how did all this happen?
with luck.

## you brought me the entire 10, 000 miles?
no.

## well, little man, still in pain?
it's all right.

## good?
that's my bat wing broth.

## anything of interest to the scientific community?
my name is atreyu.

## why don't you sit down and be quiet for once?
you keep quiet, wench.

## ever heard of me?
i've been studying the southern oracle for years.

## what do you think?
i work scientifically.

## is that the southern oracle?
no.

## why?
the sphinxes 'eyes...... stay closed until someone who does not feel his own worth...... tries to pass by.

## the sphinxes 'eyes, are they open or shut?
fancy armor doesn't help.

## so what?
that won't be too hard for him.

## the southern oracle?
do not be afraid.

## are you the southern oracle?
yes, we are.

## the empress...... needs...... a new name.
well, what is it?

## that's all?
but that's easy.

## where can i find one?
you can only find one...... beyond the boundaries of fantasia.

## do you know where they are?
i have no idea.

## then how do we find a human child?
i always thought that's what they were.

## if you come any closer...... l will rip you to shreds.
they look...... like good...... strong...... hands, don't they?

## who are you?
i am gmork.

## what's so funny?
fantasia has no boundaries.

## don't you know anything about fantasia?
it's the world of human fantasy.

## why is fantasia dying then?
because people have begun to lose their hopes...... and forget their dreams.

## what is the nothing?
it's the emptiness that's left.

## but why?
because people who have no hopes...... are easy to control.

## who are you, really?
i am the servant...... of the power behind the nothing.

## anything at all?
no.

## could the ivory tower still be standing?
let's hope so, atreyu.

## why do you look so sad?
i have failed you, empress.

## who?
the earthling child.

## you knew about the earthling child?
of course.

## what?
he's taken at least one of her organs.

## skin her?
pipe down, withers.

## do you understand?
yes, sergeant.

## an educated man, such as a doctor an educated man?
that's preposterous.

## what are you driving at?
no one in whitechapel, no matter what their trade... could afford grapes.

## what about thejews?
ajew butcher.

## but be certain you don't proceed without proof. is that clear?
of course, sir.

## dr. marbury says?
dr. marbury says i'm going to have your child.

## me neither.
of whom may we seek for succor but of thee, o lord... who, for our sins, are justly displeased?

## and what makes you think mcqueen did this to your friends?
can't prove nothing by me.

## you're mary kelly. is that right?
that's right.

## why are you so bloody useless?
come on, mary.

## before my mother died, back in ireland. is that when you came here?
yeah.

## you said, right you said those men, yeah?
the ones who took her rich artist man and who took her as well.

## what are you gettin 'at, annie?
maybe we could go with the papers.

## where is ann crook?
that sort of thing.

## guests?
ehh.

## i didn't frighten you, did i?
i been lookin'for ya. i been lookin 'all over for ya.

## you been looking for me?
not for me.

## your gentleman sent you to find me?
oh, get off. i might be unfortunate, but i'm not a blitherin 'idiot. it's the truth. it's the god's truth.

## you like grapes?
yeah.

## your gaffer, does he want anything special?
just the usual, i expect.

## what i wanna know, right... is a toff like him, how much is he offerin '?
here.

## down here?
yeah.

## straight down there, yeah?
my readers wanna know this stuff.

## found a piece of leather apron in her mouth?
this is annie.

## did the constable show you the leather they found down by the water spout?
could be part of a butcher's apron.

## this one?
yeah.

## he's really outdone himself this time, hasn't he?
he not only severed the intestines... he carefully arranged them around the neck and shoulders. i think he's taken more organs this time.

## why grapes?
only polly and dark annie were given grapes.

## yeah, but why grapes?
so they'il trust whatever he offers.

## are you ill, inspector?
a surgeon, to be specific.

## are you questioning my decision?
no, sir. i simply want to know why.

## am i right?
yeah.

## don't you think?
excuse me.

## you don't belong here, do you?
i'm afraid dr. ferral suffers from the surgeon's malady.

## and what's that, sir?
want of feeling.

## how may i assist you, inspector?
well, forgive my ignorance, sir, but, um... are you a surgeon? i was.

## well, sir... could you tell me what sort of a knife, uh, would this be?
i think you mean to draw a liston knife. it's named for liston, who was a surgeon in the crimean war.

## uh... do you, by any chance, have the police surgeon's report available?
yes, i do, sir.

## may i?
we must keep this confidential.

## wouldn't someone have heard their screams?
not if you cut their throats first.

## and how can you be sure they wouldn't react to seeing the liston knife?
grapes.

## they'd gobble them up, wouldn't they?
and he might offer them a drink to ease them down.

## how long have you chased the dragon, inspector?
well, these should help with the headaches.

## what do you think?
the intestines are simple enough.

## but, uh, the uterus?
the liver, especially.

## how far advanced is our grandson's malady?
uh, no lesions have appeared, ma'am.

## he seems to us to be suffering greatly in his mind. is the disease affecting his emotions?
it's just it's just you say three more have to be killed.

## so what are you doing here?
oh, i see.

## to what, precisely?
that mcqueen said he'd cut me unless i pay him a pound a week.

## what you mean, no?
you asked me to testify.

## you think that's funny an unfortunate like me being a decent mother?
no, no, i didn't mean that. i didn't mean that at all.

## are you serious?
sergeant godley calls 'em my intuitions.

## what might those be?
i want you to think carefully.

## ben kidney?
that's special branch she's describing, you know.

## what the hell would ben kidney and special branch be doing in whitechapel?
wait a minute.

## she's irish born, isn't she?
there's your answer.

## that's why they would be after her, right?
they were after ann crook... who was having an affair with a wealthy gentleman.

## where are you going, sir?
he said i should wait in his office.

## i don't know what floor, you bloody idiot... because i haven't been to his fucking office yet, have i?
he told me to have the desk man let me up.

## anyone go in or out?
yes, sir. i'm sorry, sir.

## does she have any relations?
no, she's a ward of the state.

## keep your mouth shut. is that clear?
sorry, sir.

## what else do you know about her?
all we know is that she was an unfortunate... who lived in the whitechapel district. i'd like to ask her a few questions.

## do you remember mary kelly?
ann, you know me. i'm your best friend in all the world.

## have you seen alice's father, ann?
he hired us to pose as artist models.

## and what exactly does that entail?
artist models.

## you think i was born a whore?
oh, i'm sorry. i'm an unfortunate, not a whore.

## so, ann crook... and the painter became lovers is that it?
he married her... in a lovely catholic church saint savior's. i was a witness, as a matter of fact.

## special branch dumped her in bishopsgate?
yeah, as an unknown.

## but why?
when i find out, i'il tell you.

## do you have little ones, inspector?
no.

## why not?
come on.

## you know him, don't you?
amen.

## have anna bring us some tea, would you, please?
ah, well, i wish i could tell you, inspector... that your story was fantastical.

## what's that, sir?
prince edward has syphilis.

## don't you see, sir?
the disease is far enough along that... the prince's hands tremble uncontrollably.

## and have you forgotten the most telling fact?
whatever else the prince may be... he knows little or nothing of human anatomy.

## how did he find out about the unfortunate and her child?
well, he has that kind of cleverness... you'il sometimes find in the middle classes.

## the old fellow isn't as far gone as all that, is he?
no.

## have you considered that she's the sort of woman who likes to make up stories... particularly about men?
sergeant godley.

## and he was with ann for what over a year?
nearly two.

## remember ada?
she's from france.

## oh, she is pretty, isn't she?
not in public, love.

## would you give us a minute alone?
we need to speak with liz.

## baby alice, she's all right?
yeah, she's all right.

## for how long?
a few days, at least.

## what?
do you think i'm paying you back? i didn't mean it as business. i'm still a woman.

## and whose job is it to take care of the widow's messes?
you've turned into othello.

## do you know that?
everything is a suspicion.

## why would ben kidney do that?
to scare people.

## which is?
think what's at stake for special branch.

## hello, sir. is anything wrong, my dear?
no, sir.

## thirsty?

## it's one of them, isn't it?

## when did he fall off that horse?
he never fell off.

## how could i have let all this happen?
finally, farinelli... what renderedus enemies for so many years... will be resolved tonight.

## did you ever ask yourself... whether it was to soothe the pain of your castration... or to still his howling conscience?
it's time you faced the truth... that has haunted you since childhood.

## why do you refuse to hear what you've known all along?
without me, you'd be nothing.

## do you hear me?
i sacrificed everything for this love.

## your brother no longer sings, riccardo... except for the king.

## so, casey, why are you passionate about harvard?
dr. healey, my mom and i have been imagining harvard practically my whole life.

## how did you know?
didn't think you'd give up.

## i can't have a conversation with anybody i haven't known since kindergarten, so how come i can do that in front of you?
because you let people see you when you skate.

five minutes.

## why didn't you win?
i had an unfortunate warm up before my short program.

## are you sorry?
look, i paid my dues.

## why on earth would i do that?

it's nobleman, not noble man.

## that'swhat i whatdifference does itmake?
itdoesn'tmake a difference, honey.

## whydoyou haveto correctme?
it's nobleman.

## why do you have to park so far away?
this ridge was a little further away than it looked.

## rodney, do you even know what it is we are looking for?
yeah, well, whatever it is, it's around here somewhere.

## what's around here?
whatever it was that was causing the energy spike we detected from the puddle jumper.

## d'you have any idea what that looks like?
i'il know it when i see it...

## what?
some kind of an energy barrier around the threshold.

## you got tape?
because...

## welcome 'and 'ascension '.
are we done?

## ascension?
to a higher plane of existence.

## any volunteers?
i'il go.

## problematic?
yeah, like poisonous atmosphere, acid atmosphere, no atmosphere.

## why did you tell us to let him go?
because you weren't gonna stop and the last thing we need is both of you to get pulled in with him.

## why would the ancestors create something that would do this?
i don't know.

## this is sheppard, can you hear me now?
that is the one thing i am not doing.

## what are you doin ', mckay?
i am trying to determine how much faster time is passing on the other side of the portal than it is here.

## why would time progress faster?
the cave opens up to the other side of the ridge but there's nothing in the immediate area i can survive on.

## how about sending me a signal to show me that you're still there?
doesn't have to be a rock, you can write a damn note.

## look, hours equate to days, and days for us could mean years for him.
why?

## and you, stay here.
do you get it now?

## and do what?
don't go through, if that's what you're thinking.

## come in?
you guys are starting to worry me a little bit here.

## what the hell took you guys so long?
alright.

## anything else?
extra batteries for the camcorder.

## you know what to do?
the excruciating pain he was experiencing was a result of the temporal differential.

## who knows what that could do to him?
i have no idea, but i suspect he could use a doctor.

## so you don't even know if he's alive?
the most time efficient approach was to assume that he was alive but stranded.

## this is mckay.
and why not assume that he'il make his own way back through the portal?

## supplies been loaded aboard yet?
almost there, sir.

## to see if sheppard's still alive?
and to determine the true passage of time on the other side.

## what're we not thinking of?
now take a minute, and be certain.

## his lifetime?
if it takes us a week to ten days to fix this, then it won't matter, because he will probably have died of old age.

## now, you ready?
it's there.

## alright, is there a safe place for us to go?
no, no, the cloister is too far.

## the jumper sensors aren't picking up anything?
nothing, ma'am.

## what is this probe of yours supposed to do?
well, it's supposed to descend slowly into the atmosphere of a gas giant.

## have we met?
when avrid first brought you here.

## you did?
you're a little young to be a doctor.

## didn't it come after you?
no.

## are you hungry?
starving.

## which one of you got me out of my clothes and into these?
i did.

## is that alright?
yeah.

## what do we have here?
i'm glad you're feeling better.

## avrid, i'm happy to visit and i'm grateful for the food and the whole healing thing, but... do you know the way out of here?
there is no way to leave, john, other than to ascend.

## what exactly do you mean by \"there's no way\"?
that is the sole purpose of this place...

## then why did you enter the portal?
exactly what i was afraid would happen.

## did you receive any telemetry before the probe failed?
actually quite a lot.

## is it so terrible here?
no, you folks have been great.

## why'd you come here?
well, i was born here.

## so what's holdin 'you back?
journeys such as ours can take a lifetime.

## you afraid it might not happen?
we're not afraid of anything.

## and what kind of life is that?

## 174 00:46:52, 615 > 00:46:54, 874 do you ever ask yourself if we'il ever get out of here?
175 00:46:54, 988 > 00:46:59, 307 of course i do, but there is a great wall in between and there are no doors.

## 178 00:47:09, 240 > 00:47:11, 812 can't you guess?
no.

## 179 00:47:52, 677 > 00:47:54, 482 will you come with me?
180 00:47:55, 717 > 00:47:57, 611 that is prohibited.

## 217 00:59:46, 223 > 00:59:47, 750 did you make a wish?
yes.

## 218 00:59:47, 800 > 00:59:51, 367 what kind of wish did you make?
to always be with bianca.

## 223 01:00:02, 047 > 01:00:03, 993 what means \"chosen\"?
it's one of the ways to get out of here faster.

## 233 01:01:35, 285 > 01:01:38, 710 what are you doing here?
today is not your turn.

## 239 01:02:00, 728 > 01:02:02, 844 aren't you happy here?

## 250 01:03:32, 928 > 01:03:35, 373 what do you mean by \"like us\"?

## 373 01:36:54, 296 > 01:36:57, 688 bianca, what are you doing there?
374 01:36:58, 252 > 01:37:00, 331 leave me alone.

392 01:47:34, 119 > 01:47:38, 164 one thing is certain:you are going to forget us quickly.

## you get all that?
manufacturer's latest gynoids go berserk, attacking their owners, company panics and recalls every one.

## you get it?
what you call getting it may be just wishful thinking.

## so, where do we start?
locus solus is located in the northern frontier.

## don't tell me you want her back?
that's part of what we've come to determine.

## need a guide?
no thanks, we'il skip the tour.

## isn't that right?
\"commit suicide \"meaning...

## miss haraway, how exactly would a robot kill itself?
by intentionally malfunctioning, these gynoids are capable of self authorizing attacks against humans.

## isn't \"self destruction \"more accurate?
if you assume differences between humans and machines are obvious.

## are such \"suicides \"confined to a particular model?
not necessarily.

## the cause?
e brain contamination from microbes and viruses, human production errors, functional defects from wear and tear.

## but?
i say it's because humans discard robots once they're redundant.

## do you have children?
a daughter.

## then what are children who endure in the chaos preceding maturity?
they differ profoundly from \"humans, \"but they obviously have human form.

## what on earth are you talking about?
raising children is the simplest way to achieve the ancient dream of artificial life.

## can we get back to reality here?
i'd like your observations with respect to the hadaly robot, model 2052, manufactured by locus solus.

## particular functions?
it's equipped with organs unnecessary in service robots.

## meaning?
it's a sexaroid.

## but, what?
we found a file in the audio buffer.

## care to hear it?
help me.

## she your type?
actually, i like older women.

## next?
follow procedure.

## lnvestigate the hadaly inspector?
09 calling 907.

## you're all alone here?
koga got reacquainted with his dinner and went back with the corpse.

## you made a rookie deal with this mess?
life's a learning curve.

## family man, huh?
i'il drop you off.

## ishikawa?
not headed his way, either.

## the chief showing up at a scene?
the corpse is missing parts, that's why.

## what\"s the big deal over a local case?
the boss has taken an interest.

## fresh dog food, huh?
stick to dry food and he'il last longer.

## you're teamed up with togusa?
beats being paired off with a rookie fresh out of training.

## what now?
stick to the dry food.

## someone took their time dismembering the corpse?
so it appears.

## why'd the perp bother with the organs?
maybe to create the impression he was a psycho or a freak.

## what's with the warped doorknob?
analysis indicates a chinese prosthetic limb, model nr26.

## did you track down the license on those yakuza wheels?
they've covered their tracks with a lot of illegal modifications.

## but where's the motive?
the kojinkai's an entrenched japanese crime syndicate.

## if volkerson knew they had it in for him, why'd he take the trouble of hiding out on their turf?
we don\"t know.

## the terrorists masquerading as deranged robots scenario?
there's no political link between the victims, so i think that's a dead end.

## do you consider yourself to be happy?
well, sure.

## chief, why did you pick me for this job?
because it was the major who plucked you off your local beat.

## what'd he want?
apparently you don't need to be caesar in order to understand him.

## you planning on starting a war?
no need to be a yakuza to pay them a visit, but we'il need weapons.

## you dislike yakuza?
sure.

## but we're just going to chat, right?
like i said, you don't need to be a yakuza...

## happy now?
just fine.

## who the fuck are you?
here to chat with wakabayashi.

## what about, \"avoid shooting?
i did as best i could.

## what's up?
narrow, dark stairs.

## what's the program?
we take turns, i'il lead.

## even presuming they went off at their most lethal range, you think two grenades are going to off an armored cyborg?
you insult me.

## betting on that obvious a move?
moron.

## still with me, pal?
all i could see... were my wife and daughter's faces.

## you still pissed off?
i am not pissed.

## pull over, will you?
later.

## hey, where are the remains of my old arm?
don't even think about it.

## when did you start tailing me?
it's no big deal, man.

## aren't originals outrageously expensive?
his was the first line bred by artificial insemination.

## and why didn't they make me blow my own head off?
i think, because they want to disgrace you, not wipe you out.

## sorry.
far north?

## are you alright?
i'm getting my radar fixed monday.

## you live in new york?
i do.

## so, it was out of compassion, right?
i m working on it.

## what about the other woman?
blind... like love.

## should i come to the restaurant?
tonight's not good.

## it's not on the sideboard?
i m talking to you.

## yes, boss.
did you move my fish?

## bouillabaisse?
yeah.

## where'd it go?
i m here to meet will.

## what happened to lynn?
i believe i baked that cake.

## i m an easy going guy, right?
i m good to my staff.

## is that a mistake?
because, an occasion, one of them has stepped over the line and said very... familiar things about my private life.

## so, warning you has no effect?
no.

## it's like a greek tragedy, isn't it?
ok guys, i've got bad news.

## tommy?
you got it.

## lady, what am i gonna do with you?
you're killing me.

## out on the patio?
before my bartender leaves his wife.

## are you too busy?
it's frantic tonight, a madhouse.

## can you bear with me 2 minutes?
sure.

## the heat's gonna be up all the way around?
i got this and the champagne is coming in any second.

## everything okay?
i'il come back later.

## is that will keane?
it sure is.

## what did you do, make a deal with the devil?
i m sorry, do...

## dolly?
i can't believe it...

## honey, are you feeling alright?
you look sort of sea foam green.

## who cares?
lf he's rich as well, you might have a fight on your hands.

## overpriced?
i can't believe you'd say...

## where else are you gonna find a beet salad... for under 35 bucks?
i loved the chilean sea bass.

## may i ask whose birthday this is?
the birthday girl happens to be my granddaughter, charlotte.

## it s not katie's daughter?
you bet.

## forget about it.
she's got katie's eyes, hasn't she?

## do you know that this kid made from scratch all these crazy hats?
they're great.

## pretty sassy, isn't it?
very elegant.

## have i ever lied to you?
no, it's wonderful.

## do you speak?
thank you.

## or, is that yours?
i think it's mine.

## how do you know him?

difficult.

her too.

five minutes.

## what's your name?

mr. king would like a word with you.

## right now?
we have a car waiting.

## hello?

## is it ever a random thing?

## what did you do?
let's just think about this...

## gordo, now is not the time for that, all right?
i'm sorry, i'm just a little...

## don't start freaking out, okay?
let's get al out of here first.

## what are you, high?
gordo, get a fucking grip.

## now you coming?
that's why al never played the inside.

## so what do you hear?
well, lionel dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night.

## i mean, cash, that much, and we never had to put him on the send?
turns out this fucking mope is an accountant for the king.

## who's that?
the cash we fleeced off him was collection money.

## currently?
a very large type pole stuck right up our asses, miles.

## mob?
no.

## how'd they get to al?
it's beautiful.

## classic fucking al, right?
so the bookie asks where he's got this money, all of a sudden.

## that he's been giving head for 20 bucks a pop?
no.

## you pissed we didn't get credit?
no, no, no.

## specifically?
i don't know.

## is he new?
miles, this guy holds a grudge better than my ex mother in law.

## the guy with the face spaz?
it's called a facial twitch, miles.

## whoa, whoa, whoa, you wanna give the money back?
i didn't say that.

## we want insurance?
jesus christ, miles.

## hollywood and vine?
okay.

## when?
two hours from now.

## how do you know the king is going to let you walk, jake?
cause i'm getting a ride.

## don't be dicking around in there, okay?
and if he shoots you or stabs you or causes you to bleed profusely, call a cab, 'cause your ass ain't getting back in here.

## so you the guy that got big al?
nope.

## okay, now you see that right there?
find out who she is.

## which?
whatever.

## the brothers, the girl or the kid?
oh that's good.

## so, are you two together?
we're sisters.

## why don't you move a little bit, so that i can check them out then you can check them out?
thanks.

## sisters, huh?
mm hmm.

## and you're over 18?
yeah.

## is that because you look so innocent, and you're kind of cute there aren't you?
yeah, it's something like that.

## you just con people out of their money?
there is actually some technique to it.

## yeah, it helps, don't you think?
i think his name was...

## the first thing i did, i go out and get myself a suit, right?
yeah, i looked good.

## everybody's checking their fingers and their toes.
we were kicking back in malibu and chinatown schmidt, right?

## i was the first thing they hit.
and who is the one guy that got hit, sailor?

## don't wear white after labor day, maybe?
no.

## you ever been here before?
my six year old nephew could con anything out of that dude.

## why?
look, if we knew dolby was connected to you, we'd never have gone near him, so i apologize for any inconvenience.

## honest mistake, all right?
it's just something between two guys that don't know each other yet.

## isn't that right?
no.

## won't?
you won't.

## that's four spot, right?
yeah.

## one of your guys, huh?
i gotta take a pill, or i'm all over the place.

## this is confidential, right?
yeah.

## how do you like that?
they're sisters.

## you did not know that dolby was connected to me?
you heard me before.

## you're gonna go work on your routine, you know why?
because you're saying that you are sisters.

## these are people here, they've got families, all right?
okay.

## ladies.
you understand?

## tell me this, how are you and i gonna resolve our shit?
i get you what i owe you, plus interest, by going on the grift for you.

## look, i came here to do a deal, not play grab ass with you, you freak, all right?
humor.

## here's what i... you don't want to sit closer?
no, i'm fine over here, thank you.

## can i see your hand?
you got a big hand.

## see this?
that's your love line.

## what's gonna happen, now?
i play a con.

## and you can because you're so good, right?
i like to think so.

## morgan price?
yes.

## why?
cause you can't get to him.

## what?
you were a fluke, a mistake.

## why morgan price?
absolutely not, that's not the way i operate.

## we're done with all this business now?
the rest of it depends on you.

## should i?
oh, right.

## so, you're interested in a little work?
you couldn't afford me.

## or is it tom or bill?
hard to tell with so many ids.

## why me?
you don't even know me.

## hasn't anyone ever said that to you before?
this is lupus.

## anybody got a light?
and this is lily.

## are we playing a con, or are we doing a rendition of \"our town\"?
gordo, trust me.

## our new mark?
morgan price.

## why?
because, that's who the king wants us to fleece.

## how much are we going after?
$5 million.

## i'm just thinking out loud here... but $5 million in a briefcase?
we never had a problem with that, before.

## yes, we have, okay?
and we would have been beautiful about it.

## i mean, are you pissed off about al?
look at me.

## all right?
so if you don't want to do it for the fucking principle, do it for the money.

## gordo?
yeah, jake, whatever.

## what are we gonna do with this stuff?
i mean, heroin.

## what do you do with heroin?
you sell it.

## to who?
don't be a knucklehead.

## how hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer?
if vig is right, we're looking at 100, 150.

## you think it's a good idea?
we never done this shit before.

## well, what is he gonna do, file a missing drug report?
hey if it works out, we could turn the guy over a few times.

## i had a cap put in here, right?
write that shit in as a cavity or something.

## did he?
yeah, he did.

## is that the guy?
let's go.

## what the fuck you got?
get on the ground.

## so, how did you get caught?
tommy suits used to say that in any con, sooner or later somebody's gonna start asking the right questions.

## am i the only one who feels like we can't make a move, with this guy on us?
i think we should ditch him.

## what the fuck is it with you and bathrooms, huh?
tell me.

## manly, all right, wise guy?
that's cute.

## you wanna run down the list?
hepatitis.

## you ever hear of that?
influenza.

## do you need a shovel down there, dear?
gordo, gordo.

## that's enough, all right?
we gotta get down to business, here.

## go talk to suits, and he'il hook you up.
all fugazze?

## we're gonna need some start up cash, first.
what about customs?

## lupus, you think the king would be willing to bank us?
you already owe him.

## gordo, do we need a banker?
let's do it.

## you know why?
because it's real.

## feels good?
feels so good.

## this guy's pretty sharp, you know?
look at me, look at me.

## what are you talking about?
oh, no.

## you brought her for a reason, didn't you, booster?
let's listen to her.

## the name is jake.
no, why don't you listen up?

## what do you say you get the add under control?
you look me in the eye when i'm talking to you.

## what's your name, honey?
her name is lily.

## have i, scooter?
it's a common mistake that jake is making when he says add.

## hyperactivity.
what he really means is adhd, for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, see?

## it's poison, see?
feel my heart.

## will you feel my heart?
i'm not gonna bite you.

## see?
much faster... than yours.

## i'm sorry, i know that was tasteless, dear.
why am i enjoying this so much, jake?

## what do you say you get your add under control, and we get to the fucking point?
ooh, i think jake is referring to my medication, which i thought was confidential.

## because if i don't, i become hyper, or primitive, right?
or impulsive.

## i'm not a violent man.
now listen to me, okay?

## i like to think i am above that, right?
tell me again.

## including what you took from me the first time?
350.

## oh, that's very good, you're smart, aren't you?
don't get hurt.

## you understand me?
so the king gave you the money.

## you sure?
jay housler, vp of international finance.

## you sure?
hey, i'm sure.

## do you have a ticket?
i lost it but the name is hanson.

## yes?
jake hanson.

## taking advantage of the long weekend?
yeah, we're...

## really?
mm mm, yeah.

## i'm sorry, sir, still nothing.
jesus, where did this happen?

## may i ask what it was?
it's a shame, it was a pair of... a pair of diamond earrings.

## is that all right with you?
if you'd be willing to do that, that would be great.

## all right?
he's gone.

## hey, how you doing?
hey guys, good to see you, man.

## what's up, boss?
right here.

## i'm gonna get the chicken and rib combo.

## hey man, can we get you a glass of water?
i'm working at this temper management issue.

## this fucking gun is killing my back.
sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer?

## who knows?
this prick has been on the wish list so long, you two guys, might even get a promotion.

## what the fuck are you getting out of all this?
not everybody is on the take.

## if you feds are so hot for this guy, why don't you just let us go out?
we'il bring him in, that's it.

## what is that, an analogy?
a metaphor.

## where the hell is she?
i have no idea.

## what?
you told me to change it.

## do you know what that means?
you have just put a mother of a jinx on us.

## gordo, can you believe this?
oy vey.

## did i miss something, guys?
sweetheart, it's the red hair.

## look, it doesn't matter, all right?
you can't fool bad luck, you can't get by on a technicality.

## that's what i get for putting a chick on the team, right?
gordo.

## lily, hold on a second, will you?
excuse me.

## is this seat taken?
no.

## right?
now what i'm gonna tell you is in complete confidence.

## in what way?
how they made their money.

## and you have this letter of intent?
yes we do.

## let me be straight with you, all right?
we're this close to cutting somebody in on the action, if they'd be willing to help.

## shall we order another round?
yeah.

## anybody want a piece?
i'm going home.

## jake?
no, i'm good.

## are you sure?
yeah.

## you gonna have time?
i'il find the time.

## for a couple hundred bucks?
not interested.

## do you?
not in that repressed anger way.

## why this?
i'm good at it.

## soon enough you'il have more to do and i have a feeling you'il be good at that too.
the thrill of it?

## how do you know?
intuition.

## what's this?
let's call that a convincer.

## what do you got?
we got jack shit.

## omar, you got it?
flight's booked to belize.

## can you picture me with a drink with the umbrella in it?
tip worked out fine, we're just a little curious about the fed.

## gunther?
i think i might know this guy.

## what are we gonna do about this jake?
we can't afford having a fed onto us like this.

## but i got good news for you, okay?
you got us.

## how did we do?
we did exactly like you said.

## why's this guy so hard up for you?
you're not exactly a threat to national security.

## but a fed?
you get a guy like that as your fix...

## so what?
we just stay clear of him.

## that doesn't mean anything?
you're being such a raving pussy.

## sweetheart, we fucked once, okay?
that does not entitle you a voice in this room.

## everyone's working an angle, right?
there are three people i trust in this world, those two guys on the couch and a dead guy.

## so why don't you just go back to wherever it is you came from?
you don't have anybody looking for you.

## what about the money?
there it is.

## you want an apology?
no.

## so that's it, huh?
that's it.

## you guys know what to do, right?
jesus christ, jake, i can't believe you're gonna just...

## what the fuck are you talking about?
i was doing it for them.

## of what?
they're both crooks.

## you know why i got that?
the king asked me for a four shot one day.

## after you cut her loose?
which was apparently my mistake.

## how'd you know we'd still go through with it?
i know you, jake.

## why don't you give me an address and i'il send over a car?
and you and i can discuss the particulars of your proposal.

## silver platter?
motherfucker, let me tell you a story.

## travis, anybody ever try something like this before?
not that i can recall.

## and how much did you say you wanted for this finder's fee?
10 %.

## today?
today started off great.

## that customs guy is ready, right?
i feel lucky today, miles.

## customs?
they say a good chess player can see up to 20 moves deep.

## and with the push of a button, all the pieces were in play.
yeah?

## gordo?
it's all good.

## mr. ashby?
mr. thompson from international calling.

## gordo?
gordo, do me a favor.

## guy's walking around with $5 million cash and he's going to stop to use a public bathroom at the airport?
un fucking believable.

## i got something on me?
i'm going to be straight with you, lupus.

## what do i have to do?
all right.

## you guys take care of butan?
don't worry.

## what?
you gonna have to take it in the airport.

## about your three shot, four shot espresso sob story?
showing me your little boo boo.

## that?
i got that at a barbecue, grilling halibut.

## you trust this butan guy?
i don't trust anybody.

## you see how bad this guy wants vig?
it's like a sickness.

## you guys awake?
yeah, we're here.

## this it, harlin?
motherfucking no brains, this one has.

## you go back to fetching coffee for the king?
don't worry about me.

## not for nothing, jake, but the guy who whacked your buddy?
it was me.

## turn around.
what?

## can i make a suggestion?
take these cuffs home and use them on your wife.

## how about you?
let's go.

## he who?
you gotta like it.

## okay.
how hard do you think it is to sell one dealer's drugs to another?

## what happened?
he got caught.

## what?
what the fuck...

## it's all about the money, isn't it?
i'm gonna ask you one more time before your brains hit the ground.

## where is my money?
probably in the hands of the federal government.

## what was that you were saying about playing the big con, it's like putting on a big play, and everybody knows their part?
i guess some people forgot their fucking lines.

## you guess so?
so why don't you just take a deep breath, jake, and i'm gonna count to 10.

## did you kill him?
should be a four letter word.

## who knows?
hey.

## how'd it go?
smooth.

## maybe you'il get yourself a new tie with that?
but a fed, you get a guy like that as your fix...

## so what do you got going next?
so that's how gunther butan and i became friends.

## you take your cut?
yeah, i'm good.

## wherever it is, don't stay too long, you know?
stay loose.

## what's this?
is like putting on a play.

## but what do i care?
i'm dead.

## miles, would you be so kind?
absolutely.

## the antichrist?
i'm just a guy looking for some answers.

## hey, you know, pal, ain't we all?
things are probably gonna end bad for you tonight, jake.

## honestly?
just the last three weeks.

## calm down, okay?
i'm sorry.

## what other fucking choice do i have?
the motherfucker was gonna welch.

## listen to me, all right?

## lionel, he's dead, all right?
maybe you didn't pull the trigger, but you were standing right there and you saw me do it.

## then you know what, lionel, maybe you should go.

you don't get the nice splatter effect.

## hey, jake, when do i get to play the inside?
gordo plays the inside.

## what are you talking about?
you should get a fucking academy award for the shill work you do.

## big al, does anyone do it better than you?
come on, we've got a good thing going here.

## you want to jinx us by changing things?
yeah, you're right, i don't want to jinx anything.

## what?
it's a lot of cash.

## did you see how quickly he got out of here?
he's not coming back, it's over.

## how do you know the king is going to let you walk, jake?

## so you the guy that got big al?
nope.

## okay, now you see that right there?

## why don't you move a little bit, so that i can check them out then you can check them out?
thanks.

## sisters, huh?
mm hmm.

## and you're over 18?
yeah.

## is that because you look so innocent, and you're kind of cute there aren't you?
yeah, it's something like that.

## you just con people out of their money?
there is actually some technique to it.

## yeah, it helps, don't you think?

## i was the first thing they hit.
and who is the one guy that got hit, sailor?

## don't wear white after labor day, maybe?
no.

## you ever been here before?
my six year old nephew could con anything out of that dude.

## why?
look, if we knew dolby was connected to you, we'd never have gone near him, so i apologize for any inconvenience.

## honest mistake, all right?
it's just something between two guys that don't know each other yet.

## isn't that right?
no.

## won't?
you won't.

## that's four spot, right?
yeah.

## one of your guys, huh?
i gotta take a pill, or i'm all over the place.

## this is confidential, right?
yeah.

## how do you like that?
they're sisters.

## you did not know that dolby was connected to me?
you heard me before.

## you're gonna go work on your routine, you know why?
because you're saying that you are sisters.

## these are people here, they've got families, all right?
okay.

## ladies.
you understand?

## tell me this, how are you and i gonna resolve our shit?
i get you what i owe you, plus interest, by going on the grift for you.

## look, i came here to do a deal, not play grab ass with you, you freak, all right?
humor.

## here's what i... you don't want to sit closer?

## can i see your hand?
you got a big hand.

## see this?

## what's gonna happen, now?
i play a con.

## and you can because you're so good, right?
i like to think so.

## morgan price?
yes.

## why?
cause you can't get to him.

## what?
you were a fluke, a mistake.

## why morgan price?
absolutely not, that's not the way i operate.

## we're done with all this business now?
the rest of it depends on you.

## i spotted that lift from across the club.
excuse me, miss?

## should i?
oh, right.

## so, you're interested in a little work?
you couldn't afford me.

## or is it tom or bill?
hard to tell with so many ids.

## why me?
you don't even know me.

## hasn't anyone ever said that to you before?
this is lupus.

## anybody got a light?
and this is lily.

## are we playing a con, or are we doing a rendition of \"our town\"?
gordo, trust me.

## our new mark?
morgan price.

## why?
because, that's who the king wants us to fleece.

## how much are we going after?
$5 million.

## i'm just thinking out loud here... but $5 million in a briefcase?
we never had a problem with that, before.

## yes, we have, okay?
and we would have been beautiful about it.

## i mean, are you pissed off about al?
look at me.

## all right?
so if you don't want to do it for the fucking principle, do it for the money.

## gordo?
yeah, jake, whatever.

## what are we gonna do with this stuff?
i mean, heroin.

## what do you do with heroin?
you sell it.

## to who?
don't be a knucklehead.

## how hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer?
if vig is right, we're looking at 100, 150.

## you think it's a good idea?
we never done this shit before.

## well, what is he gonna do, file a missing drug report?
hey if it works out, we could turn the guy over a few times.

## i had a cap put in here, right?
write that shit in as a cavity or something.

## did he?
yeah, he did.

## is that the guy?
let's go.

## what the fuck you got?
get on the ground.

## so, how did you get caught?
tommy suits used to say that in any con, sooner or later somebody's gonna start asking the right questions.

## am i the only one who feels like we can't make a move, with this guy on us?
i think we should ditch him.

## what the fuck is it with you and bathrooms, huh?
tell me.

## manly, all right, wise guy?
that's cute.

## you wanna run down the list?
hepatitis.

## you ever hear of that?
influenza.

## do you need a shovel down there, dear?
gordo, gordo.

## that's enough, all right?
we gotta get down to business, here.

## go talk to suits, and he'il hook you up.
all fugazze?

## we're gonna need some start up cash, first.
what about customs?

## lupus, you think the king would be willing to bank us?
you already owe him.

## gordo, do we need a banker?
let's do it.

## you know why?
because it's real.

## feels good?
feels so good.

## this guy's pretty sharp, you know?
look at me, look at me.

## what are you talking about?
oh, no.

## you brought her for a reason, didn't you, booster?
let's listen to her.

## the name is jake.
no, why don't you listen up?

## what do you say you get the add under control?
you look me in the eye when i'm talking to you.

## what's your name, honey?
her name is lily.

## have i, scooter?
it's a common mistake that jake is making when he says add.

## hyperactivity.
what he really means is adhd, for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, see?

## it's poison, see?
feel my heart.

## will you feel my heart?
i'm not gonna bite you.

## see?
much faster... than yours.

## i'm sorry, i know that was tasteless, dear.
why am i enjoying this so much, jake?

## what do you say you get your add under control, and we get to the fucking point?
ooh, i think jake is referring to my medication, which i thought was confidential.

## because if i don't, i become hyper, or primitive, right?
or impulsive.

## i'm not a violent man.
now listen to me, okay?

## i like to think i am above that, right?
tell me again.

## including what you took from me the first time?
350.

## oh, that's very good, you're smart, aren't you?
don't get hurt.

## you understand me?
so the king gave you the money.

## is that all right with you?
if you'd be willing to do that, that would be great.

## all right?
he's gone.

## hey, how you doing?
hey guys, good to see you, man.

## what's up, boss?

## who knows?

## what the fuck are you getting out of all this?
not everybody is on the take.

## if you feds are so hot for this guy, why don't you just let us go out?
we'il bring him in, that's it.

## what is that, an analogy?
a metaphor.

## where the hell is she?
i have no idea.

## what?
you told me to change it.

## do you know what that means?
you have just put a mother of a jinx on us.

## gordo, can you believe this?
we're dead.

## did i miss something, guys?
sweetheart, it's the red hair.

## look, it doesn't matter, all right?
you can't fool bad luck, you can't get by on a technicality.

how they made their money.

## and you have this letter of intent?
yes we do.

## let me be straight with you, all right?
we're this close to cutting somebody in on the action, if they'd be willing to help.

## shall we order another round?
yeah.

## anybody want a piece?
i'm going home.

## jake?
no, i'm good.

## are you sure?

## you gonna have time?

i'm good at it.

## soon enough you'il have more to do and i have a feeling you'il be good at that too.
the thrill of it?

## how do you know?
intuition.

## what do you got?
we got jack shit.

## omar, you got it?
flight's booked to belize.

## can you picture me with a drink with the umbrella in it?
tip worked out fine, we're just a little curious about the fed.

i think i might know this guy.

## what are we gonna do about this jake?
we can't afford having a fed onto us like this.

## but i got good news for you, okay?
you got us.

## how did we do?
we did exactly like you said.

## why's this guy so hard up for you?
you're not exactly a threat to national security.

## but a fed?
you get a guy like that as your fix...

## so what?
we just stay clear of him.

## that doesn't mean anything?
you're being such a raving pussy.

## sweetheart, we fucked once, okay?
that does not entitle you a voice in this room.

## everyone's working an angle, right?
there are three people i trust in this world, those two guys on the couch and a dead guy.

## so why don't you just go back to wherever it is you came from?
you don't have anybody looking for you.

## what about the money?
there it is.

## you want an apology?
no.

## so that's it, huh?
that's it.

## you guys know what to do, right?
jesus christ, jake, i can't believe you're gonna just...

## what the fuck are you talking about?
i was doing it for them.

## of what?
they're both crooks.

## you know why i got that?
the king asked me for a four shot one day.

## after you cut her loose?
which was apparently my mistake.

## how'd you know we'd still go through with it?
i know you, jake.

## why don't you give me an address and i'il send over a car?
and you and i can discuss the particulars of your proposal.

## silver platter?
motherfucker, let me tell you a story.

## travis, anybody ever try something like this before?
not that i can recall.

## and how much did you say you wanted for this finder's fee?
10 %.

## today?
today started off great.

## that customs guy is ready, right?
i feel lucky today, miles.

## customs?
they say a good chess player can see up to 20 moves deep.

yeah?

## gordo?
it's all good.

## mr. ashby?
mr. thompson from international calling.

## gordo?
gordo, do me a favor.

## guy's walking around with $5 million cash and he's going to stop to use a public bathroom at the airport?

## what do i have to do?
all right.

## you guys take care of butan?
don't worry.

## what?
you gonna have to take it in the airport.

## about your three shot, four shot espresso sob story?
showing me your little boo boo.

## that?

## you trust this butan guy?
i don't trust anybody.

## you see how bad this guy wants vig?
it's like a sickness.

## you guys awake?
yeah, we're here.

## this it, harlin?

## you go back to fetching coffee for the king?
don't worry about me.

## not for nothing, jake, but the guy who whacked your buddy?
it was me.

## turn around.
what?

## can i make a suggestion?
take these cuffs home and use them on your wife.

## how about you?
let's go.

## he who?
you gotta like it.

## okay.
how hard do you think it is to sell one dealer's drugs to another?

## what happened?
he got caught.

## what?
what the fuck...

## it's all about the money, isn't it?
i'm gonna ask you one more time before your brains hit the ground.

## where is my money?
probably in the hands of the federal government.

## what was that you were saying about playing the big con, it's like putting on a big play, and everybody knows their part?
i guess some people forgot their fucking lines.

## you guess so?
so why don't you just take a deep breath, jake, and i'm gonna count to 10.

## did you kill him?
should be a four letter word.

## who knows?
hey.

## how'd it go?
smooth.

## maybe you'il get yourself a new tie with that?
but a fed, you get a guy like that as your fix...

## so what do you got going next?
so that's how gunther butan and i became friends.

## you take your cut?
yeah, i'm good.

## wherever it is, don't stay too long, you know?
stay loose.

## what's this?
is like putting on a play.

## but what do i care?
