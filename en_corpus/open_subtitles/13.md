## is there a new plan?
i thought we tried goin 'under.

## how's the egg count?
i've laid five eggs this morning.

huh?

## where are you?
ooh.

## that might work.
what haven't we tried yet?

## how many more empty nests will it take?
perhaps it wouldn't be empty if she'd spent more time layin 'and less time escapin '.

## isn't it obvious?
he's a professional flying rooster.

## do you suppose?
you took a rather nasty fall.

she said you sprained your wing.

## where am i?
you're right.

## and where is that exactly?
the name's rocky.

## uh, who wants to know?
a group of rather desperate chickens.

## and what brings you to england, mr. rhodes?
why, all the beautiful english chicks, of course.

## how are you?
nope.

## in fact, you know what they call me back home?
you can teach us.

## you hear that?
that's the open road calling my name, and i was born to answer that call.

## okay, okay, where's the exit?
ah, this way.

## which part of \" they kill us \" do you not understand?
i got my own set of problems to worry about.

## all of you?
that's what i've been trying to tell you.

i'm trying to lay low here.

## would you?

## do you know what'il happen if he finds me?

## with this wing?

## okay, the ground's shaking.
just keep the faith there, uh what was your name?

## are we worried?
this is our future, mr. tweedy.

## no more eggs?
this isn't good, mac.

## where is he?
they didn't give me this medal for being a yank nanny.

## and the pig says to the horse, \" hey, fella, why the long face?
oh, oh, look, look.

## isn't that the cutest?
and that bunty.

## have we flown over that fence?
to learn how to fly.

## you can't compare the two, okay?
the point is, these things take time.

## why?
thrust.

## would you excuse us?
aye.

## hmm?
you stupid norbert.

## what are these two crooks doing here?
so, you know each other.

## promised them every egg i lay this month.
so, uh, how about them eggs?

## and when can we expect the first installment?
i'm brewing one up as we speak, guys.

## what?

## is that your first offense?
oops.

## can't you see that?
strange boxes arrive in the barn.

## don't you see what's happening?
they're fattening us up.

## do you mind?
keep eating.

## i've met some hard boiled eggs in my day, but i'd say you're about 20 minutes.
what are you doing?

## what's that supposed to mean?
it means you got to lighten up.

## that's been working like a real charm, hasn't it?
here's some free advice.

## you want them to perform?
tell them what they wanna hear.

## you know what your problem is?
you're... difficult.

## because i'm honest?
well, here she is.

## and how's that egg coming?

## all right, pops, what did i do now?
a very brave and honorable deed, sir.

## you see what i'm tryin 'to say?
oh, a cannon.

## so, what's the next plan, hen?
fowler.

## what do you mean, what is it?
the royal air force is what.

## there she is.

what, now?

## are those the only choices?
let's do it.

## you mean you never actually flew the plane?
good heavens, no.

## what are you waiting for?
no.

## why don't we get an egg and start our own chicken farm?
that way we'il have all the eggs we could eat.

## if you don't have a chicken, where you gonna get an egg?
from the chicken that comes from the egg.

## what do you mean, where 'dit come from?
egg comes rollin 'along, happy as larry.

## it's wonderin ', where 'dit come from?
without a chicken, you get no egg to come rollin 'along.

## so we got two eggs now?

i haven't the faintest idea.

## did you ask her?
no, and i don't intend to.

## well?
your other daughter, mrs. rutledge.

## they alike?
they're alike only in having the same corrupt blood.

## well?

## who's this joe brody you paid the $5000 to?
i can't recall.

you want me to take this geiger off your back.

## want to know anything?
i just want to get rid of him.

## instructed you how?
i see, sir.

## you write his checks?
i have that privilege.

## how did she know i was here?
she saw you through the window.

## are you attempting to tell me my duties, sir?
just having fun trying to guess what they are.

## so you're a private detective?
i didn't know they existed, except in books.

## you're a mess, aren't you?
i'm not very tall either.

## now, this business of dad's, think you can handle it for him?
it shouldn't be too tough.

## what will your first step be?
the usual one.

## there's a usual one?
sure there is.

## hear what i said about the drink?
i'm serious.

## no professional secrets?
i thought you wanted a drink.

## when did he go?
about a month back.

## who's they?

## i'm afraid not.
can i be of any assistance?

## how about a chevalier audubon, 1840, full set?
not at the moment.

## grapefruit?
i'il run along to the library.

## or i could go to that bookstore across the street, couldn't i?
do so.

## would you do me a small favor?
it depends on the favor.

## you know geiger's bookstore?
i think i may have passed it.

## wouldn't it be easier to go and ask to see him?
i've already done that.

## i know anything about rare books?
you could try me.

## or a chevalier audubon, 1840?
nobody would.

## going to wait for him to come out?
they don't close for another hour or so.

## that's right, it is, isn't it?
it just happens i got a bottle of pretty good rye in my pocket.

## what's the matter?
i'm just wondering if you have to...

## who's the man getting out?
geiger's shadow.

## a ben hur, 1860?
with duplications.

## what do you know about this?
mr. geiger, here on the floor.

## how did it happen?
you talk a lot, reilly.

## is she..?
good evening, mrs. rutledge.

## are you sure..?
yes, she'il be all right in the morning.

## that?
oh, yes, that's a little special service...... i always provide all my clients.

## where did you find her?
i didn't find her.

## then how..?
i haven't been here, and she hasn't been out all evening.

## just what did happen?
you're fond of your sister.

## do anything for her, wouldn't you?
anything.

## what'd she tell you?
not half as much as you did.

## may i call a cab?
it'd be better if you didn't.

## what you been doing?
just sitting around.

## does it have to be something?
you're a friend, but when a man from homicide...... just drops in at 2 a. m., i kind of...

## working on cipher, huh?
just fooling around.

## you're working for the sternwoods, aren't you?
thanks to you.

## done anything for them yet?
i started today.

## who?
shawn regan.

## what would anybody be doing down there?
that's what i'm going to lido to find out.

## want to come?
yeah, i do.

## how's the weather?
clearing up.

## what time did that call come in?
about 15 minutes ago.

## what kind of car you say it was?
packard.

## who is he?
owen taylor.

## what's the story?
you can see it from here.

## steering wheel?
whatever it was, it was covered.

## blackjack?
could be.

## you know anything about owen taylor?
only that a few sternwood chauffeurs...... lost their jobs on account of the younger daughter, carmen.

## carmen?
this doesn't look like the way you'd handle it.

## me?
i didn't do this.

## what were you going to say, phil?
give me another day, bernie.

## who's he?
a french writer.

## we're going to start that again?
i'm sorry.

## so you know about that?
poor owen.

## you still can't tell me what my father wants you to do?
not without his permission.

## you can't even tell me if it was about carmen?
you better look at this.

## the demand came how?
a woman telephoned me after it was delivered.

## there has to be something else?
this thing isn't worth $5000 to anybody.

## why?
she said if they didn't get the money today...... i'd be talking to my sister through a wire screen.

## what kind of a jam?
i don't know.

## you know where this picture was taken?
i haven't the slightest idea.

## talk to carmen about it?
she was asleep when i left.

## figure out a story?
norris fixed that.

## how?
she was in all evening.

## what was owen doing with your car last night?
nobody knows.

## why?
you think...

## that he knew about this picture?
i don't rule him out.

## outside of what the woman said...... you don't know why they want $5000 for it?
that's why i came to you.

## why didn't you go to the police?
you were afraid they'd find something i couldn't sit on.

## may i use your phone, mr. marlowe?
police headquarters, please.

## sergeant reilly?
there isn't any sergeant reilly here.

## the police?
my father should hear this.

## who is this?
yeah, but she just told you that...

## i hope the sergeant never traces that call.
what can i do for you?

## why did you stop me phoning?
because i'm working for your father.

## can you get it?
i think so.

## where from, your father?
i'd rather not.

## where would you get it?
well, from eddie mars.

## the gambler?
that explains why you haven't got $5000 in cash.

## how do you know he'il give it to you?
i can get the money.

## that doesn't interest you?
it might make it easier for me to find him.

## is regan mixed up in this?
no.

## tell you what?
what you're trying to find out.

## you could go on forever, couldn't you?
it'il give us something to talk about next time.

## that call, how'd you leave it?
she's to call me at 6 p. m.

## remember me?
i'm afraid i...

## something geiger wants.
do you remember me now?

## is he in?
no, he isn't.

## is he sick?
i could go to his house.

## hurry up, will you?
perhaps...

## who's the other guy?
you'd better come tomorrow.

## early?
because it looks like you're moving today.

## where are we going?
follow a car.

## day and night?
night's better.

## remember me?
i'm doghouse reilly.

## what's the matter, couldn't you get in the house?
come on.

## where'd you leave your car?

## remember what?

## what, that he's dead?
i don't know.

## was it joe brody?
joe brody.

## who's he?
i don't know how much trouble you're used to...... but i hope you've had plenty of practice dodging it.

## i kill who?
yes, joe did it.

## why?
i don't know.

## but you're ready to tell the police he did it?
that is, if we can get the photograph.

## you mean..?
it's gone.

## mr. geiger around?
we don't know where he is.

## friends of his?
business.

## any message if he comes back?
no, i don't think so.

## suppose i don't want to talk to you?
i've got two boys out in the car.

## it's like that, eh?
run along, angel.

## got a better one?
maybe i can find one.

## do you mind?
no, i'm used to it.

## who are you, soldier?
marlowe.

## who's the girl?
a client.

## that your business?
could be.

## now what do you think of it?
you know some nice people.

## got any good ideas?
one or two.

## don't you, mr. mars?
wondered why you didn't ask me who i was.

## what racket?
i wouldn't know.

## you really got those boys outside?
open the door.

## who is he?
philip marlowe, hobart arms, franklin street.

## sidney?
he's company for pete.

## who cleaned out geiger's store?
lots of weather we're having.

## did it rain at las olindas?
i might make it worth your while.

## what do you care who cleaned out geiger's store?
i could make you talk.

## why don't you call the cops?
i think you'd better get out of here.

## by the way, how's mrs. mars these days?
you take chances, marlowe.

## she didn't call?
no, she didn't.

## did you get the money, in case she does?
i have the money.

## you said what?
arthur geiger.

## so what?
so you're joe brody.

## if you think you got something.
don't you think we ought to talk?

## you alone, joe?
except for this.

## you ever hear of him?
if he gets wise to where you were last night, you'il hear of him.

## what would i be to eddie mars?
i don't know if you don't.

## why don't you ask your friend to come out?
she must get tired of holding her breath.

## why'd you lie to me?
i don't need you.

## will you get out?
but he won't let me.

## can't you talk without that?
to keep her from paying you off, and to take the cops off your neck.

## what cops?
the cops that want to know where the lead in geiger came from.

## you think you've got me?
positive.

## how come?
i told you, there was a witness.

## who are you?
a guy who gets paid to do people's laundry.

## how about some dough?
i'm down to nickels.

## now where were we?
oh, yes, you were just about to get something.

## can i have my gun?
later.

## what's the matter, sugar?
he gives me a pain...

## where's the pain?
in my...

## why'd you put the bee on mrs. rutledge?
i tapped the old man six months ago.

## how well do you know her?
we'il pass that.

## say, joe, how'd you get that picture?
you got what you came for, and you got it cheap.

## do i, agnes?
but you just gave it to me.

## did i hurt you much?
you and every other man.

## where'd you get that picture?
it fell out of somebody's pocket.

## got an alibi for last night?
i was here with agnes.

## a couple of murders?
i mean two murders.

## where were you?
all right, i was watching geiger's place.

## why?
to get something on him.

## who else was back there?
nobody.

## i know where that packard is now?
it's in the sheriff's garage.

## and you want me to believe somebody came along...... ran that car to the ocean, pushed it off the pier...... then hid geiger's body?
well, i didn't...

## what do you want?
sit in that car, back of the wheel.

## hello.
who said i got a key?

## is this who i think it is?
it's marlowe.

## how are you fixed for red points?
i haven't got any.

## who has?

## how are you today?
better than last night.

## got a table for us?

## how'd you happen to pick out this place?
maybe i wanted to hold your hand.

## why'd you want to see me?
my father was very pleased when he saw the morning papers.

## you tell him it was no fault of yours?
no.

## it is, isn't it?
as far as geiger is concerned, yes.

## tell me, what do you do when you're not working?
play the horses, fool around.

## no women?
i'm generally working on something, most of the time.

## could that be stretched to include me?
i like you.

## find out mine?
i think so.

## any suggestions?
i can't tell till i've seen you over a distance of ground.

## what makes me run?
i'il give you a little hint.

## was it eddie mars?
all right, don't answer me.

## but your father didn't tell you to pay me off, did he?
no.

## are you sure?
i know it hasn't worked so well up till now.

## what's eddie mars got to do with this case?
nothing.

## did you know he owned the house and was mixed up in that racket too?
i don't believe...

## what's eddie mars got on you?
come now, angel.

## pardon me?
the only trouble is, we could have had a lot of fun...... if you weren't a detective.

## have you got a phone?
over there.

## how much is that?
55 cents.

## may i speak with mr. mars, please?
this is mars.

## you didn't bump him off, did you?
no.

## you think i did?
that's what i came here to ask you.

## you're kidding?
all right, i'm kidding.

## don't you get it back next time?
she spends it somewhere else.

## you mind if i look the place over before i go back?
go ahead.

## could it be you know where she is, and maybe regan too?
stop being curious.

## tailing me in a gray plymouth coupe?
no.

## why should i?
i can't imagine, unless you're worried about where i am all the time.

## mr. marlowe?
mrs. rut...

## mr. marlowe?
mrs. rutle...

## how did you know?
he told me.

## what kind of game is this?

to settle something.

## you've already been paid, haven't you?

i wish you'd show it.

## what's eddie mars got on you?
so that's the way it is.

## what does the hat check girl get for a tip?
i'm trying to think of something appropriate.

he must have changed his mind.

## who changed it for him?
general sternwood.

## personally?
all right.

## any reason given?
not that i know of.

## who's somebody?
i think it's eddie mars.

## why?
for one thing, he owns the house geiger was killed in.

## what have you got that hooks mars up with mrs. rutledge?
i think there is, and it's got something to do with shawn regan.

## what does the general think about all this?
i don't know.

## you still want me to lay off?
the da does, but you do all right following your own hunches.

## you want a cup of coffee?
i can't afford to be seen with you.

## hello, norris?
this is marlowe.

## why not?
i've been trying to call you.

## what the hell are you doing here?
listen to me, you have to go now.

## nat, where are you?
say something.

## you always knew she was crazy, didn't you?
unhinged. illogical.

## isn't that exactly what you tried to do?
she tried to kill you.

## did you know that?
no.

## where's my daughter?
i want my daughter back.

## what have you done with my daughter?
listen.

## you just don't get it, do you?
this man is not who he says he is.

## why can't you just leave me alone?
i'm your mother.

## why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?
it's a fascinating philosophical query, marriage versus sex.

## i'm not too fond of it either, but what else would you call this?
tyler, you are wasted.

## how'd you know, my brother?
you know this city never sleeps.

## fly?
better than fly.

## what did i tell you about drinking and dating?
you got to meet her, you and sarah.

## super fly?
better than super fly, man.

## you still there, bitch?
yeah, i'm here.

## tyler, you okay?
sounds like true love.

## is that ricky martin over there?
we only got two hours of \" happy hour \" left.

## let me just get my towel, okay?
got it.

## so you love her, right?
of course i love her.

## what?
sex.

## sex is still good?
the sex is awesome.

## so what is it?
it's nothing.

## so what is it?
give us one.

## how many?
i'm not quite sure that i've had enough.

twice your age.

## what's wrong with going for both quality and quantity?
being the best he can be, that's the american way.

## foul?
it's foul.

## what foul?
humping before the shot.

## i was humping you?
prison style.

## would i?
yeah, you'd know it.

## deep, right?
yep.

## a little help?
the thing is, i never expected to feel empowered.

## am i a manipulative bitch or what?
welcome to my world.

## what was the alternative, to keep waiting?
it's not like the sex gets better with every passing year.

## am i right?
i'm sorry that was so quick.

## and marrying me would be the \" shit \" part of that colourful analogy?
thanks.

## am i right, davey?
no, you're wrong, asshole.

## cowgirls, wilder chicks, the amish, what?
it's not like that.

## the perfect match that completes us, makes us whole?
exactly.

## it's a lock, right?
it's like destiny.

## so, if it's inevitable, why rush into it?
you're still not telling us everything.

## so did she write you?
not at first.

## eleven?
her parents found my letters and...... quite understandably freaked out.

## can you keep it that way?
it makes you seem kind of creepy.

## sarah, hey, how are you?
i just thought i'd call and see how you were.

## how's new york?
busy.

## why \" oops, shit \"?
i made a list of all the things i wasn't going to...... say to you like, \" i miss you.

## so how are you?
miss you.

## is that it?
he can't do that.

## who do you like?
give me $5 on super thong.

## you want to make a truly informed decision?
get off your ass and go see what it's like out there.

## the game?
i. e.

## a beer for my friend?
thank you.

## hey, asshole, what is your problem?
you shouldn't drink anymore.

## why shouldn't i?
i just got here.

## buy you a drink?
actually, i'm think i'm gonna leave.

## you aren't married, are you?
not yet.

## did mikey show?
yes.

## how'd he play?
actually, i think he used the \" you're less than nothing to me \" strategy.

## surrounded by all these available women?
more than ever.

## you ready to go?
okay, so you had a close encounter with something.

## is that so bad?
it's bad if it keeps you from hooking up with a woman...... who's attractive, smart, and of legal, consenting age.

## don't i owe it to myself...... to try and find her?
you're hunting sasquatch.

## she's a sasquatch?
she's a myth.

## so what exactly is all this crap?
it's market research.

## so why don't you just move here?
i don't know.

## who is that?
it's mr. hahn.

## and you get paid?
look at it mathematically.

## you sure you don't want any late night eats?
no.

## how's the chili?
i'd give my right arm for a bowl.

## can you do this?
you've done it before, you can do it again.

## can you?
don't let her get away.

## what's your problem?
she left, crap sack.

nothing.

## at 4:00 in the morning?
it's cheaper.

## how'd i do what?
how did you, you know...

## how did you find somebody who made the cut?
i don't know.

## mikey, what is this all about?
nothing.

## yeah?
pull this shit again, you don't get to be my best man.

## so, anything i should be doing?
this is the glamorous world of market research.

## why are those men wearing diapers?
i guess i can answer that question for you, sir.

## you can answer that?
yes.

## what are you doing for lunch?
i'm sorry julie couldn't make it tonight.

## you were wandering around in traffic?
yeah, i guess it was in traffic.

## right?
anybody who isn't mike, of course.

## isn't that one of the signs of the apocalypse?
nostradamus actually predicted it.

## why do you think david's so reluctant to take the next step with me?
oh, david.

## by working in a relationship with this guy for the past five years...... i have actually undermined any possibility of a future with him?
yeah.

of course.

## you guys know her?
from school.

## you work here?

you're channelling barry white again.

## he went out with a stripper?
yeah.

## can i buy you a drink for old times 'sake?
yeah.

## i mean, when did that change?
it didn't.

## do you think that amy chick would take the bid?
i thought that was dave's old flame.

## when did it get so difficult to figure out what i want?
if you're like most people, darlin '...... right around the time you found something worth wanting.

## hand me that dildo, will you?
she circled my ad.

## you there?
pick up.

## i'm looking at her picture, okay?
damn marlin jumped right into my boat, caught me unawares.

complete blank.

## what?

i'd like to thank you for the nightmare.

## isn't she strong?
caught with your videotapes down.

## but dave does, doesn't he?
come on, they're your sins.

## you want to see death?
take a good look.

## do you want to hurt her, too?
help him find billy mahoney.

your cloaking device is highly coveted.

there they are two children, judging by their size.

## what is this?
it's a miniature of the island.

hold on.

## why are you still hiding?
we're kids, not monsters.

## what's the difference?

## you work for the o. s. s., don't you?
i work for a man named donnagon.

## who is this guy?
donnagon's not interested in your creatures.

## why not?
the transmooker device that hides your island that's what donnagon really wants.

## what are you babbling about now, juni?
the transmooker you took from the president's daughter, gary.

## why not?
he has his reasons.

## well, i don't believe in that do you?
lf you want to be a good spy, you better believe it.

## now what?
something's got us.

## mom?
we wanted to join you.

## where is it?
the other side of the island.

## with those monsters running around?
i don't believe they're monsters.

## well, what should i believe?
i don't know.

## be with me?
they wanna be picking me out of their teeth, is what they wanna be.

## you're not afraid?
first thing you gotta do is...... fall into this pit.

## how does it work?
supposedly, they're run magnetically.

## okay.
why?

## you're sure you're reading that map correctly?
the coordinates correspond to carmen and juni's current position.

## what?
aah.

## aah.
and why are we doing this?

## when we get lost, who saves us?
mom and dad.

## now, if mom and dad also disappear, who's gonna stop donnagon from using the transmooker device?
donnagon wants us all together so he can destroy the island and all of us with it.

## what did what did you just do?
we lost carmen.

## how do you ever know what's right?
well, there it is.

## how do you know?
cause it's big and weird and in the middle of the room.

## what are you doing outside of your cage?
i have no idea.

## are you ready to cooperate this time, romero?
my watch has a gps satellite, you dope.

## how can this be?
when you took out the transmooker, the island cloaking device was shut down.

## then what are we doing on foot?
later, romero.

## what are you doing?
trying to remote pilot our submarine to the surface so we can get out of here.

## two spies who didn't want to be found?
yes.

## but you know what?
those spies didn't have me for a mom.

## you okay, hon?
all right. lnformation.

## do you want something to help you relax?
you bet i'm upset.

what's the word?

## like winkie wise?
oh, right.

## yeah, is that clear?
crystal.

## where have you been?
out in the hamptons, of course.

## what, another one?
you've written four books in three years.

## why don't you go and talk to him?
i couldn't.

## what would i say?
oh, i wouldn't worry about that.

## how do you do?
i know who you are.

## why does the existential dilemma have to be so damned bleak?
yes, we're alone in the universe.

## but is that necessarily so depressing?
i couldn't agree more.

## don't you think secular humanism is yummy?
oh, delish.

## yes, it's incredible, isn't it?
the physiology of touch.

## do you know the largest organ in the human body?
i can guess.

## actually, most of the screaming...... takes place...... in the bedroom.
can we go to your place?

## who are you?
don't play games with me.

## who's your little friend?
maybe i should be running along.

## oh, really?
and i'm tony danza.

## this is just sad.
well, then tell me...... who was in the broadway cast of the pajama game?

## will you shut up, bitch?
please, alison, let me kiss you.

## remember the champagne, the corpuscles?
all right, elliot, kiss me.

## you're never gonna use that, are you?
lmperialism and the first world war.

## shall we say 10:00, 10:30?
no point in getting up too early.

## i've been really naughty, haven't i?
a good spanking's in order.

## do you think everything is about sex?
no, of course not.

## you're just a big boy scout, aren't you?
i find that incredibly appealing.

## what about alison?
i don't know anymore.

## what exactly do you have in mind?
i want to do something great for mankind, to help make a better world.

## it's an entirely new play.

i don 't recall anybody accusing me of being fair before.

## are you all right?
not really.

## ls it something you can tell me?
no, it's personal.

## why don't you just try me?
i sold my soul to the devil for seven wishes.

## you promised the devil you wouldn't?
no, because she drove.

## oh, what do i do, what do i do?
i choose \" book you.

## anyway, darling, have you thought of your last wish?
i hate to rush you, but there's a time limit.

## do you think this halo's too much?
no.

## what do you mean, you don't want it?
you get seven wishes.

## what is that supposed to mean?
well, last night, when i was lying in jail, i was talking to this guy...... and i realized that wishing just doesn't work.

## so it's okay?
well, no, elliot.

## oh, really?
before you get all hinky, i should warn you.

## heaven?
god, no, it's the courthouse.

## how's that sound?
sounds good to me.

## not like that.

no, of course not. they couldn't give a fig for all that rubbish.

## how do i find that out?
a place you never would have seen without my help.

## it's fun, isn't it?

imperialism and the first world war.

## no point in getting up too early, is there?

## do you think everything is about sex?
no, of course not.

## you're just a big boy scout, aren't you?
i find that incredibly appealing.

## what about alison?
oh, i don't know anymore.

## what exactly do you have in mind?
i wanna do something great for mankind.

## we're going to a play?

i have work to do.

## what's this whole \" get thee behind me \" thing?
we still have business here, mr. richards.

## what?
that wasn't a wish.

## what do you call it?
i don't recall anybody ever accusing me of being fair before.

## what?
no, this isn't right.

## are you all right?
uh, not really.

## is it something you could tell me?
okay, a few days ago i sold my soul to the devil for seven wishes.

## do you?
this is so unnecessary.

## so, do you have a copy of this contract?
no.

## at this nightclub in oakland?
yes, at a nightclub, and no i can't tell you where it is.

## so, you either book me or you let me go.
because you promised the devil you wouldn't?

## oh, what do i do, what do i do?
i choose \" book you.

## she's the devil, that one.
what?

## what?
i said, she's the devil, that lady cop.

## so, what you in for, brother?
eternity.

## why do you say that?
doesn't really belong to you in the first place.

## so, who does it belong to?
it belongs to god, that universal spirit that animates and binds all things in existence.

## who are you?
just a friend, brother.

## pathetic, aren't they?
everybody wants to go to the party, but nobody wants to pay the piper.

## anyway, elliot, my darling, have you thought of your last wish?
no.

## do you think this halo's too much?
no.

## what do you mean, you don't want it?
you get seven wishes.

## do you know, that is so inspiring.
what is that supposed to mean?

## so, it's okay?
well, no, elliot.

## so, let's just get on with it, shall we?
i'm not gonna do it.

## oh, god.
oh, really?

## heaven?
god, no, it's the courthouse.

## what?
nobody ever reads the contract.

## huh?
basically, it says... ifyou commit one truly benevolent act, it voids the contract.

## so i get to keep my soul?
yes, you get to keep your soul.

## you're not gonna tell anyone, are you?
no, no, i promise.

## i mean, why are you... being nice?
look, elliot, i'm gonna let you in on a little secret.

## so, i can go now?
unless you want another seven wishes.

## how are you?
i'm great.

## you believe that?
neither does she.

## you know why?
because she's lying to you, that's why.

## you understand me?
lying.

## well, which one is it?
60 %% of all human communication is nonverbal.

## what else is she gonna say?
no matter what, no matter when, no matter who... any man has a chance to sweep any woman off her feet.

i was in la perla just buying some weekend thongs.

## and he was doing likewise?
no.

## casey, who buys high priced lingerie for their mother?
well, maybe he was looking for a robe.

no.

## why?
i'm gonna google him.

urban myth.

## really?

## is that a problem?
because if it is, that's fine.

you know, not just for anybody.

## let's see, what can i say?
my company handles her finances.

## so does she know you're interested?
no.

## alive?
i lent her my pen once.

## does anyone have a pen?
here, take mine.

## as in allegra cole?
yeah, i realize that i'm not her usual type.

## i know, okay?
i just thought that maybe with your help...

## you know what?
i'm really sorry i wasted your time.

## but at the same time, hoping that she still finds happiness... even if it's never gonna be with you?
you are flat out... out of your mind.

## you know that?
that's good.

## heard of the sistine chapel?
michelangelo.

## you saying you can do this?
my name is alex hitchens.

## and what were you thinking of investing in, allegra?
well, it's something that i really have a passion for.

## what is the objective?
shock and awe.

## what is the objective?
shock and awe.

## what is the objective?
excuse me, sir.

## yes, albert?
i don't really agree with that.

## you don't really agree with what?
i think if you want to invest $500, 000 in your friend's business... that's exactly what you should do.

## how'd it go?
you said...

## okay?
just let it marinate for a second.

## could i speak to you a second?
answer the door, albert.

i don't think i have one.

## what's her drink?
usually beer.

## what's your name?

chip, seriously, that was not code for, \" i wish you'd try harder.

## feel like a natural woman?
sorry i'm late, honey.

## how was the meeting?
well, there was a beginning, a middle, and an end.

## but on the other hand, should that be your problem?
so life's kind of hard all around.

## so what would a guy like that say?
he'd say, \" my name is alex hitchens and i'm a consultant.

## no?
he'd be interested.

## don't you hate it when that happens?
not really.

## what?
vance munson.

## have you ever met someone... and you knew right away she was gonna be important to you?
not just because of her looks, but that x factor.

## how'd you meet her?
actually, i was in a shop buying pajamas for my mom.

## oh, jacques, are you sure?
my darling, of course.

## yes, my darling?
i don't think that's such a good idea.

i...

## you need the rest, you know?

oh, i agree with the inspector.

## what are you all talking about?
the notorious phantom.

## well, who has the most fabulous diamond in the world?
i suppose i do.

## why should you?
when the present government seized power... they claimed the diamond was the property of the people.

you and i could split the insurance.

## your highness?
i'd love to.

## how about you, madame?
yes, of course.

## what?
i say, your leg is better.

## how'd you like to borrow mine?
thanks, uncle charles, yes.

## you know what i've been thinking?
yes, that's why i've been avoiding you.

## what?
well...

## what do you think, george?
well, i think maybe i was wrong.

## can't it wait?
i'm afraid not.

## the phantom?
yes, you must come at once.

## yes?
i am a husband that must be envied by all other husbands.

## do you want to call it off?
i don't know.

## what's that?
the possibility that you're growing a conscience.

## about what?
the princess.

## who is it?
bellboy.

## what is it?
flowers.

## what kind of hospitality is that?
but, listen, my husband could be back any minute.

## perhaps the phantom is hiding under the bed?
that's more like it.

## suppose jacques doesn't go to brunico?
not a chance.

## suppose he finds out the prefect never really called him?
stop this.

## a sexual yo yo?
first you jump in my bed.

## where?
i don't know, but not tonight.

## you know what your trouble is?
you just can't make up your mind.

## where's your husband?
out in 12 feet of snow, chasing the phantom.

## darling?
it's locked.

## what do i do?
answer the door.

## yes, dear?
i don't recall that being there.

## why should anybody want me to go to brunico?
oh, my darling.

## darling, listen, why don't i have a nice bath?
and afterwards, we have our lovely, warm bed.

## did you not bathe earlier?
yes, i did, but it would warm me up and help me to relax.

## yes?
hello, my darling.

## why did you draw the curtains?
just to keep me warm.

## warm?
warm is one thing.

## why don't you let me wash your back for you?

## what are you doing?
it broke off.

## why aren't you in bed, my darling?
i was...

## what?
it's very strange.

## why don't you come to bed?
you know, i don't understand this.

## darling, what's the matter, my darling?
it's very strange, my love, but suddenly i'm freezing cold.

## you're freezing cold?
the window is open.

## yes?
i just arrived in town.

## yes?
princess dala, please.

## what did you say?
i said he could come as one of the borgias.

## what's a borgia?
good evening.

## but from now on, perhaps a more practical approach?
i'm sorry, my darling.

## shall i say you're not here?
no, it's all right, darling.

## sir charles?

yes, probably a rich uncle.

## you see, gentlemen?
perfectly safe.

## without an invitation, how could sir charles get past your guards?
where the phantom is concerned, your highness...

## it's our ambassador.
what's wrong?

## ambassador?

## what is that?
if your highness were to testify on their behalf...

they'd just claim he dropped it making his escape.

yes.

## and sir charles attended all 16?

## becca?
becca.

## she was afraid, wasn't she?

## rachel, you there?
he...

## who watched it?
our son.

## you wish i was around more?
no.

## do you want to be around more?
you're here to take my place, send me back into the void, and rob me of all i have.

## who is it?
he was alone on mount cithaeron.

## see him?
without the slightest delicacy... come, \" little swollen feet \".

## but what, if i can't remember it?
i lay awake till dawn came.

## do you remember?
it's a real feast, better than ours.

## when will you leave?
tomorrow at dawn.

## why should i wait?
i don't want that dream to come and torment me again.

## you understand?
of course i know.

## and?
come with me.

## who could have imagined that?
nobody dares drive it back to the abyss, even thought the man who does will marry jocasta, the queen of thebes.

## there's an enigma in your life.
where are you going?

## what is it?
i don't want to know it.

## when you came here, didn't you rid us of the sphinx?
you didn't perform this act because you're wiser than we.

## why hasn't he returned yet?
creon is here.

## shall i tell it before all or inside the house?
before all.

## what can his sentence be?
death or exile.

## who might the victim be?
before you, the king was laius.

## where can we find the traces of a crime which took place so long ago?
here, the god said.

## abroad?
he was going to apollo's shrine, and he never returned.

## no guard or travelling companion witnessed the murder?
only one escaped.

## what?
from one thing others can be deduced.

## what?
that he wasn't killed by bandits but by a wayfarer.

## who could prove it?
the only living witness.

## what frightens you?
let me go home.

## this is what you think?
obey your own judgement, and beware of remaining here among us.

## you look, and do not see the shame and evil in which you are.
who's responsible for these lies, you or creon?

## do you know that your kind, living and dead, curse you?
one day you will see only darkness.

## who begot me?
i've got power and the people on my side.

## how long ago was laius killed without a trace?
a long time.

## did he utter no prophecies?
yes, winning the respect of everyone.

## he didn't mention me, by chance... in his prophecies?
in my presence, never.

## then... into the death of laius, your king you made no inquiries?
surely, but in vain.

## in this case, why did tiresias not say anything?
i don't know.

## and you don't know that you two agree when he says i'm the murderer we are seeking?
tell me.

## don't you share power with her?
of course i do.

## what do i lack?
no.

## why you and creon?
because your brother accuses me of laius's murder.

## did he make this charge on his own or was he prompted?
laius was killed at a crossroads.

## where is it?
on the road to apollo's shrine...

## how long ago?
the news of his murder reached us shortly before your arrival in thebes.

## how old?
tall, with a big long beard.

## does it frighten you so to be your mother's lover?
many men dream of that.

## maybe they live in fear?
the truth must be sought.

## but was he travelling alone, your husband laius, or with a great escort?
he was with five men, four soldiers and a servant, on a cart.

## and who said that?
the servant who escaped.

## is he here, this servant?
no.

## why do you ask me of him?
ask me no questions, i said too much.

## i am his wife.
after such prophecies, with what heart could i return home, to my parents in corinth?

## speak about what?
good news for your house.

## from whom?
from corinth.

## isn't his father, old polybus, king of corinth?
he was.

## is this the man?
yes.

## were you laius's servant?
yes.

## what were you?
shepherd.

## where did you graze?
on cithaeron, or thereabouts.

## this man, do you know him?
i'm trying to remember him.

## why do you ask me?
oedipus, your king, is the baby of that day.

## what would you want me to say?
i did.

## was he your son or not?
he wasn't mine, he was given me by... others.

## he was laius's.
who?

## his slave or his son?
this is a thing that cannot be said.

## did she give you the baby?
yes.

## with what orders?
to kill him.

## why this atrocity?
because she feared bad prophecies.

## which ones?
that he would kill his parents.

## why did you allow him to be saved?
out of pity.

## where are we?
in a place with many trees in a row and many little streams and a green, green field.

## you want a drink?
i think we're out of beer.

## we out of beer?
you're empty.

## what are we doing?
i don't know.

## stop what?
oh, my god.

## should we stop?
no.

## what?
come here.

## no more of this crap, all right?
from now on, we act like a married couple.

## you understand?
no.

## who can understand such a flaming pile of bullshit?
oh, jack.

## what are you talking about?
you know, you shouldn't leave me with hank...... and put me in that position.

## what position?
jack, listen to me.

## what?
something's going on.

## what are you really worried about?
it's you and hank being left alone together.

## i'm supposed to feel guilty because of that?
terry.

## is that what it is?
hank doesn't love her.

## he said that to you?
yeah.

## oh, yeah?
yeah.

## why did he tell you that?
i don't know.

## he just blurted that out?
seems odd.

## how else do people tell each other things?
when people say things like that they're doing other things.

## what do you care?
i don't.

## the truth?
jack, you won't even admit the truth.

## so, what are you gonna do today?
make up stories.

## you signed up for summer classes?
sure.

## why not?

the way he looks at her, the way he looked at us...... when we came back from buying beer.

## and how was that?
sheepish.

## me?
no.

## have you eaten enough?
i don't know.

## wouldn't you?
no, i wouldn't.

## don't you think he's gonna notice?
well, if he does, it'il be a miracle.

## sometimes you think what?
sometimes i think that i love you even more than i think that i do, which is a lot.

## impotent as you are?
give me a cigarette.

## you're okay with that?
it's okay.

## what?
mom, stop it.

## what's this?

so then i checked his gym bag, and the clothes were folded and clean.

## do you want me to ask hank?
yes.

## how was your run?
still wet.

## what?
relax.

## why is it that you say you love our children and they go unbathed for days?
right now sean is upstairs sleeping in last night's piss.

## who are you to judge me?
oh, that was shitty.

## accusing me of not loving my own children?
that's just the way you fight, like a catty, bitchy woman.

## and you know what?
if you ever got them up in the last four or five nights...... you would've known he hadn't wet his bed.

## so?
you never get the facts right.

## then, later that night, he fucked my wife in the front seat of my car.
so, what do you want me to do?

## where were you?
woke up, couldn't get to sleep, so i went for a walk.

## did you ever go to sleep?
yes.

## why didn't you come to bed?
because i need to be made love to.

## you gonna see him again?
god.

not you.

## wanna watch us, jack?
this comes to you...

## you think you know yourself, but you know what?
you're a pervert.

## what do i say?
gee, hank, that was last night...... and this is now, and i just don't know if i wanna fuck anymore.

## where's hank?
he's sleeping.

## upstairs?
yeah.

## how's it going?
good.

## take your car, okay?

## you know, the bar all the bag ladies drink in?
alone in a bar for the first time in my life.

## what happened?
never mind what happened.

## don't you wanna stop that, terry?
give me a reason, jack.

## just one, you know?
as if the luck of catching a fish would make me more lovable.

## jack, how would you know if you hated me?
you don't even know me.

## does that mean i'm a cook...... an errand runner, a fucker, a goddamn cleaning lady?
because if you, you bastard, lost all discipline and folded up...... and turned drunk and got bald and lost everything, i'd love you.

## or is that just another one of the tricks i do for you?
screw hank, shake hands, sit, roll over, play dead, fetch...... love me like a dog.

## what?
i love edith.

## so when are you leaving?
i don't know.

## why don't you come to bed?
i wanna clean my house.

## what's she doing?
she's doing everything.

## are you talking to daddy?
hey, come here.

## who said that?

if you believe in god, it's adam and eve...... and if you don't, apes.

## did you know that they just found things that said that god had a wife?
it's true.

## what if they don't believe in god?
no, i mean, people that look for him thought that.

## what are you doing?
i thought that's where you went to tell the kids.

## couldn't you tell them?
i don't want to.

## is it just the kids?
you can see them whenever you want.

## just unpack my bags, okay?
we can do this.

## honey, what's wrong?
somebody was mean to her at school.

## want some coffee?
no.

## drink?
yeah.

## hey, hank?
hank.

## what?
you knew all along.

## you okay?
i'm drowning in shit.

## where's sharon?
she's outside waiting in the car.

## what's going on?
edith.

## isn't it, edith?
yeah.

## well, then why leave now?
because i can.

## you feeling any better?
a little bit.

## what?
grandfather's here.

## mom, can't you tell him that i'm sick?
i think i'il leave you two pals alone.

## what is it?
open it up.

## are you kidding?
fencing.

## isn't that a wonderful beginning?
yeah.

## is this a kissing book?
wait, just wait.

## when it gets good?
keep your shirt on.

## but what if something happens to you?
i will always come for you.

## but how can you be sure?
this is true love.

## you think this happens every day?
westley didn't reach his destination.

## despite humperdinck's reassurance that she would grow to love him, the only joy she found was in her daily ride.
would you like to meet her?

## a word, my lady?
we are but poor, lost circus performers.

## is there a village nearby?
there is nothing nearby.

## what is that you're ripping?
it's fabric from the uniform of an army officer of guilder.

## who's guilder?
the country across the sea.

## am i going mad or did the word \" think \" escape your lips?
if there are, we'il all be dead.

## anybody want a peanut?
we'il reach the cliffs by dawn.

## why are you doing that?
making sure nobody's following us.

## you're sure nobody's following us?
as i told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable.

## out of curiosity, why do you ask?
those are the shrieking eels.

## what?
the eel doesn't get her.

## do you know what that sound is, highness?
only compared to some.

## whoever he is, he's too late see?
the cliffs of insanity.

## did i make it clear that your job is at stake?
he has very good arms.

## hello there.
he didn't fall?

## thank you.
slow going?

## i do not suppose you could speed things up?
if you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do.

## you don't know any way you'il trust me?
nothing comes to mind.

## do you always begin conversations this way?
my father was slaughtered by a six fingered man.

## how old were you?
i was eleven years old.

## you've done nothing but study swordplay?
more pursuit than study lately.

## you are ready, then?
i thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain.

## naturally, but i find thibault cancels out capo ferro, don't you?
unless the enemy has studied his agrippa, which i have.

## then why are you smiling?
because i know something you don't know.

## and what is that?
i am not left handed.

## what do i do?
finish him, finish him.

## which way is my way?
pick up one of those rocks, get behind the boulder, in a few minutes, the man in black will come running around the bend.

## so what happens now?
sportsmanlike.

## you mean, you'il put down your rock and i'il put down my sword, and we'il try to kill each other like civilized people?
i could kill you now.

## look, are you just fiddling around with me or what?
i just want you to feel you're doing well.

## were you burned by acid, or something like that?
oh no.

## why is that, do you think?
well, i haven't fought just one person for so long.

## why should that make such a difference?
well, you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.

## how did it end?
the loser is nothing.

## could this be a trap?
i always think everything could be a trap, which is why i'm still alive.

## and you're no match for my brains.
perhaps an arrangement can be reached?

## let me put it this way:have you ever heard of plato, aristotle, socrates?
yes.

## really?
in that case, i challenge you to a battle of wits.

## it is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man.
for the princess?

## all right:where is the poison?
the battle of wits has begun.

## are you the sort of man who would put the poison into his own goblet, or his enemy's?
now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given.

## you've made your decision then?
australia.

## you'd like to think that, wouldn't you?
you've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong.

## where?
i don't see anything.

## what's so funny?
i'il tell you in a minute.

## who are you?
i am no one to be trifled with, that is all you ever need know.

## and what is that worth, the promise of a woman?
you're very funny, highness.

## you think your dearest love will save you?
i never said he was my dearest love.

## you admit me you do not love your fiance?
he knows i do not love him.

## what can i do for you?
you can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.

## why loose your venom on me?
you killed my love.

## another prince, like this one, ugly, rich, and scabby?
no.

## does it bother you to hear?
nothing you can say will upset me.

## and what am i?
faithfulness he talked of, madam.

## what have i done?
he disappeared.

## i told you, i would always come for you.
can you move at all?

## why didn't you wait for me?
well, you were dead.

## what's the matter?
they're kissing again.

## do we have to hear the kissing part?
someday, you may not mind so much...

## so now, where were we here?
yeah, yeah, yeah.

## you?
well, one thing i will say.

## since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?
i myself am often surprised at life's little quirks.

## what?
go on.

## is everything clear to you?
we'il never succeed, we may as well die here.

## i mean, what are the three terrors of the fire swamp?
one:the flame spurts.

## rodents of unusual size?
i don't think they exist...

## you mean you wish to surrender to me?
very well, i accept.

## ah, but how will you capture us?
you have six fingers on your right hand, someone was looking for you...

## where am i?
the pit of despair.

## then i'm here till i die?
till they kill you, yeah.

## then why bother curing me?
the prince and the count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.

## you don't believe me?
you survived the fire swamp.

## where is that written?
yes.

## why do you do this?
because you had love in your hands, and you gave it up.

## didn't i tell you she'd never marry that rotten humperdinck?
yes, you're very smart.

## you returned this westley to his ship?
yes.

## beloved, are you certain he still wants you?
after all, it was you who did the leaving in the fire swamp.

## are we agreed?
your princess is really a winning creature.

## now, where is that secret knot?
it's impossible to find.

## are you coming down into the pit?
westley's got his strength back.

## beautiful, isn't it?
it took me half a lifetime to invent it.

## what did this do to you?
tell me.

## and remember, this is for posterity, so be honest, how do you feel?
interesting.

## any word from westley?
too soon, my angel.

## is everybody out?
he's with the prince in the castle.

## how many could you handle?
i don't think more than ten.

## what?
look, he bested you with strength, your greatness.

## where?
to find the man in black, obviously.

## why not?
that is the sound of ultimate suffering.

## his true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for ultimate suffering?
excuse me, pardon me, it's important.

## you get there from this grove, yes?
fezzik, jog his memory.

## inigo?
father, i have failed you for twenty years.

## what did fezzik mean, \" he's dead?
i mean, he didn't mean \" dead \"...

## who gets humperdinck?
i don't understand.

## who kills prince humperdinck?
at the end, somebody's got to do it.

## who?
nobody.

## what did you read me this thing for?
you know, you've been very sick and you're taking this story very seriously.

## all right?
okay, all right, now, let's see.

## where were we?
oh yes.

## have you any money?
the king's stinking son fired me.

## look, i'm retired.
while you're at it, why don't you give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it?

## besides, why would you want someone the king's stinking son fired?
i might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle.

## he is, eh?
i'il take a look.

## you got money?
65.

## he probably owes you money, huh?
well, i'il ask him.

## what's that?
true... love...

## why'd you say that name?
you promised me that you would never say that name.

## what, humperdinck?
humperdinck.

## give me the sixty five, i'm on the job.
i make him better, humperdinck suffers?

## that's a miracle pill?
the chocolate coating makes it go down easier.

## and you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what?
an hour.

## think it'il work?
it would take a miracle.

## what's the difference?
we've got him.

## has it been fifteen minutes?
we can't wait the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.

## how long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works?
your guess is as good as mine...

## why won't my arms move?
you've been mostly dead all day.

## where's buttercup?
let me explain...

## what are our liabilities?
there is but one working castle gate...

## and our assets?
your brains, fezzik's strength, my steel.

## that's it?
impossible.

## my brains, his steel, and your strength against sixty men, and you think a little head jiggle is supposed to make me happy?
i mean, if we only had a wheelbarrow, that would be something.

## where did we put that wheelbarrow the albino had?
over the albino, i think.

## well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place?
what i wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.

## where did you get that?
at miracle max's.

## why?
you can't even lift one.

## true, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?
don't pester him, he's had a hard day.

## what?
i hope we win...

## should i be?
brides often are, i'm told.

## now?
not yet.

## now?
light him.

## have you the ring?
here comes my westley now.

## then why is there fear behind your eyes?
give us the gate key.

## what was that for?
because you've always been so kind to me.

## it's simply incredible.
won't that be nice?

## have you been chasing me your whole life only to fail now?
gently.

## good heavens.
at a time like this that's all you can think to say?

## are you still trying to win?
i got married.

## what?
it never happened.

## did you say, \" i do \"?
a technicality that will shortly be remedied.

## where's fezzik?
i thought he was with you.

## why does westley need helping?
because he has no strength.

## shall i dispatch him for you?
ah, there you are.

## have you ever considered piracy?
you'd make a wonderful dread pirate roberts.

## what?
maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.

## you feeling any better?
a little bit.

## what?
grandfather's here.

## mom, can't you tell him that i'm sick?
i think i'il leave you two pals alone.

and you say you want to know why decisions are made.

## why argue about decisions you're not powerful enough to make for yourself?
energy will treat you well, you know that.

## what do you mean, i'm not going?
i hope this isn't an inconvenience.

## who told you you're supposed to go with me?
nobody told me.

## get yourself another assignment, will you, daph?

## what chance does houston have of defeating tokyo tonight?
both teams have fine players and different styles.

## what about the rule changes?
well, at houston, we kinda play a wide open system.

## will you comment on a game where the rules are always changing?
the game's always had rule changes.

## what's the secret of your success?
oh, it's no secret.

## any comments?
i don't think it will.

## you know what i mean?
yeah...

## i just wanna get out there and hit them little fellas.
you all right?

## listen, stay close now, all right?
i don't know.

## your team mate has no family and permission is required now before consummating matters.
all right?

## so, he's technically dead?
yes, unfortunately.

## does he dream?
no, there is no brain wave at all, no sort of consciousness.

## who can say?
please.

## it's alive, isn't it?
you must sign.

## it's embarrassing to misplace things.
will you follow me, please?

## you've misplaced some data?
mm, the whole of the 13 th century.

## you want to get started, don't you?
yes, sir.

## do the executives still come here?

## books, books?

## provide, huh?
they were responsible for takin 'you away and i started to hate 'em.

## just like that, huh?
but you've got to do it now.

## they tell you that?
yes.

## they tell you to convince me to quit?
yes, but that isn't why i came here.

## are you my big reward?

i've been slapped around worse.

## dwight?
he was from awhile back...... before you showed up again with that new face of yours...... and... it was only because i felt sorry for him.

## or do i take this cop down and risk it all?
then jackie boy saves me a great big streaming pile of trouble.

## well?
there's only so much a man can take.

## humiliating me like this for no damn reason at all?
that's far enough, dwight.

## where else would one bullet buy us the fortune that we're getting for this?

## what's this stuck in it?
bloody hell.

## i'm at the bone, all right?

you tell her the truth and she's dead.

## see?

## that tammy, there she's fine, isn't she?

## you see that?
she flinched.

## did something happen to her?
nothing.

## nancy's 19 years old.

hartigan.

## confessing to raping a little girl and blubbering for mercy?
no, doesn't work.

## you care for a ride?

## any word from eileen?
yeah.

## how did they find out who you are?
and what have they done to you.
