## Nothing. Why, whaddya hear?
A raft.

## No wonder we both struck out with her. Who can compete with the sexual power of the man who occupies the highest office in the land?
He's like the Pope. Like we're gonna snake a girl away from the Pope.

## You thinking what I'm thinking?
You found my treasure? Why didn't you tell me.

## Do you know what this means?
Hey Lloyd. This looks like another one of your mix tapes.

## What was it Jessica wanted us to do with this chest again?
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.

## What? What did we do?
We never thanked him for giving us our Special Needs class.

## Ready Lloyd?
LLOYD, what I'm saying is we may already have what we want.

## I don't think that'll happen. We've learned a valuable lesson we won't ever forget.
Oh my god. Can you believe your ears?

## Hold up. First, we have to decide who gets who, remember? No more competition?
Right.

## Okay. Which one do you want?
The one on the left.

## What?
You take her.

## Hey, where'd you go?
Beats me. It's Jessica's Dad - she said he's really anal.

## So can I come along?
No.

## Are you wearing a coconut bra?
Oh, you're good.

## You mean the lunch room?
I thought I told you to get lost.

## Poor question. Too wordy. A good question gets right to the point. Example, where's my chest?
I don't know what you're talking about.

## So what did you say to my parents on the phone?
Not to expect you tonight.

## TURK, what are you doing here?
Special Needs class.

## Why ith dat newth?
This school's never had one before. I'd like to talk to you and all your special friends.

## Yes, what?
Don't answer me. Say what I say.

## What are you doing here?
Checking up on my friend, Harry.

## What?
You know, \"some\". The fag stuff.

## So could you get us into the principal's office?
Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.

## Tomorrow night?
Oh, baby, you're the bestest.

## What are you doing?
Let's just do it and get out of here.

## That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it?
No, it was a complete waste of time.

## Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?
Thanks, Lloyd. But I didn't find what I was looking for. Oh can you do me a favor and clean up? Collins can't know we were here.

## LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
HARRY's treasure chest? Sure. I know where that is.

## Well I need to get a job and you're telling me that if I join up - I can really come and go whenever I want?
You were born free and free you should remain.

## Do I know you?
Duh. I'm in your class at school.

## Oh my God, it's really you. You're HARRY's friend, right?
I don't know if you'd call us \"friends\"...

## Hello, little orphan boy. What happened to you?
Skateboard.

## How much homework is there?
That's the downside. There is none.

## Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
You can bring whatever you want, little friend.

## Do we have a deal?
KID Yeah, deal. Give me the two dollars.

## Thanks for the grub, Mrs. D. Where's Mr. D?
He passed away three years ago.

## Hey can be on top?
Mrs. D! I was hoping you'd show up.

## Oh yeah, give it to me.
Have you got what I want?

## How was that?
It's too close to call. Okay next contest, now lets...

## Your assignment is to pick the class. Find some other students just as special as you.
LLOYD, may I see you a minute?

## Will that be on the midterm?
No.

## Obviously.
That's not bad. How about a float of George Washington crossing the Delaware?

## I think you did it.
What?

## What the hell are you talking about?
I'm not sure if I can do this.

## We start our own class?
Maybe someday. Aloha cold weather, aloha hot weather.

## So far so good. We'll need more pictures. Why don't you take them on a field trip tomorrow.
To take a picture for Superintendent Zimmer?

## And...?
And, take some more pictures.

## Who's there?
Guess what\"s under these coconuts.

## What?
It's a surprise.

## You got the Extender?
Monkey, this is too exciting! I can't believe our dream is coming true.

## So what do you keep in there?
Oh, things. Photos. Tapes. I tape everything that goes on in this office.

## Everything?
Everything. Just for the record.

## Baby, I'm going to spend the morning at the mall. You know, shop for Waikiki. Honey, what are you looking for?
The chest! The chest that I put my papers in.

## What papers?
The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence.

## Where is it?
I don't know where it is. It's not here. It's been stolen.

## JESSICA. Are you sure?
She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.

## Are you going to kill her?
Why don't you see to it the kids are ready for the parade tomorrow. I have to pay somebody a little visit.

## Well there's a reason why that mascot isn't a stallion anymore.
I sold all the wind instruments. Hawaiian Air, business class. And you like that new fur coat?

## This is horse?
No... no it's not horse, you see I sold the horse.

## What does Leto say, Piter?
I prefer the more ancient term, planetologist... Noble Born.

## What's that you're saying?
Nothing.

## Yes?
Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.

## Yes?... How was your journey?
Many machines on Ix... new machines.

## Is this what you seek?
Good... the slow blade penetrates the shield... but look down.

## Would you really have drawn my blood?
If you'd fought one whit below your abilities I'd have scratched you a good one.

## Perhaps these are the ones Mapes told us of.
My Lord?

## Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
No, but many consider my training valuable.

## You know the ancient tongues?
I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.

## Do you know this my lady?
It could only be one thing.... It's a crysknife.

## What does she fear? What about my Father?
Paul... please, Paul... listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you.

## Where are we do you think?
The South Polar regions... the forbidden area. We must make it to that rock...

## I can't... I can't.
Is he....?

## Cinnamon... the spice! Do you smell it?
Yes...

## What's happened?... Why did it leave?
Someone started another thumper.... We're not alone.

## Are you a Fremen?
I am a servant of the His Majesty the Emperor. I have served His Majesty on Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.

## You've worn a stillsuit before?
No.

## Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?
No one. It... seemed the proper way.

## Will we see a worm?
Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.

## Always?
Always.

## Bless the Maker and his water... Bless the coming and going of him. May his passage cleanse the world.
Why do they come?

## You are about to witness something few have seen -- watch! Watch!
Liet?

## What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
We call that one Muad'dib.

## Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib?
You are Paul Muad'dib, and your mother shall be a Sayyadina among us.... We welcome you.

## My own name is a killing word. Will it be a healing word as well?
Pain.

## Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?
It burns.

## Pain by nerve induction... A human can resist any pain. Our test is crisis and observation.
You feel the flesh crisping?

## Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true?
Not all of them... I know which ones will.

## What is it?
The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.

## ... Many men have tried.
Did they try and fail?

## Did they try and fail?
They tried and died.

## My father sent you to test me. Music then?
Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we know the Harkonnens would not have given up their CHOAM company contract so easily.

## I know. But if it is a trap then why are we going?
No. I never drink -- wine.

## Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi?
I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.

## Who are you? What do you want?
Because I'm planning on dying soon.

## Really?
I refuse to drive in this country. Too many madmen.

## Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead such an exciting life. When is your next picture coming out?
I have no next picture.

## The women?
Certainly. But now the children of the night are calling me.

## Hey Bela, how do you do that?
You must be double-jointed, and you must be Hungarian. Vampira, look at me! Stare into my eyes.

## Do you want me to get it for you?
No thank you, Eddie. I'll be alright.

## Are you sure this is okay?
Huh?! Oh yeah, of course.

## That's good. I could use the money.
But, I don't like horses. Do I have to get on one?

## Dracula?
No! Doctor Acula! You can still wear the cape, have the fangs... but you're a doctor! Not a count.

## Should I call a doctor?
Nah. This happens all the time...

## Is there anything I can get you? Water? A blanket?
Goulash.

## What's in the needle?
We didn't make a dime.

## Mmph? Where am I?
You're shooting \"Bride Of The Atom.\" Scene 85.

## What is this place?
This is the Philosophical Research Society. A refuge for free thinkers. I've been coming here for twenty years.

## Was I wrong to cast Loretta?
Bad decisions are easy to live with. Forget. Just keep looking forward.

## Really?
It was a very impressive offer. Fancy offices, a big home... I'd be treated like a king.

## So why didn't you do it?
But maybe not.

## Let's shoot this fucker! Where do I go?
You'll be fighting with the octopus.

## Out there?! What happened to the stream?
This'll look a lot better. We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.

## Okay! How do we turn this thing on?
Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.

## Huh?
Bela, I've got twenty-five scenes to shoot tonight.

## What are you doing?
I was thinking about killing myself.

## Don't you have any savings?
I'm obsolete. I have nothing to live for. Tonight, I should die. And you should come with me.

## Bela, I'm on your side. C'mon, give me the gun... If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink. What are you drinking?
Formaldehyde.

## Eddie, I wanna make another picture. When are we gonna make another picture?
Soon, Bela... Soon.

## So Eddie, don't we need a sound crew?
No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.

## Oh. So what is the scene about?
Uh... you're a very important and respected man. You're leaving your house... and you're in a hurry to a big social event.

## Okay. But what if I'm not in too big a hurry? What if I take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life? To smell a flower?
That's great. Let's do a take.

## Eddie, how was I?
Perfect.

## Has anyone ever been to Downey?
Last night was quite a romp.

## Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
I envied him. Hell, I envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that.

## You mean a Tesla coil?
Absolutely! It's just the beginning. I promise this, If we stick together, one day I'll make every single one of you famous.

## What happened?! Jesus, Connie, what did you do?
Nothin'! I told him he was great.

## And who may you be?
Edward Wood, Sir.

## Hey Cris, how'd you know we'd be living on Mars by 1970? How'd you know it wouldn't be 1975, or even 1980?
I guessed.

## It's that easy?
Eddie, we're in show biz! It's all about razzle-dazzle. Appearances. If you dress nice and talk well, people will swallow anything.

## Incidentally, you promise you're not going to scratch my car...?
I told you, the octopus is made of rubber. This is a piece o' cake.

## Edward, are you sure you know what you're doing?
Yeah. It seems a little crazy, but sometimes you just know. She's perfect for me.

## Will he be okay?
We'll do our best.

## Isn't he?
No. They say his eligibility ran out years ago.

## Honey, what if I'm wrong? What if I just don't have it?
Ed, it was only one review.

## Eddie, I don't understand. Why are you the most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story?
Aw, er, it's just a bunch of hot air. I had to say something to get in the door.

## So did you get his autograph?
Ed, I'm so proud! I'll read it as soon as I get home.

## How long have you been doing this?
Since I was a kid. My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing. It just kinda became a habit.

## How can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people?
Hon', nobody's bothered but you. Look around -- they couldn't care less.

## Ed, who is Daniel Davis?
Toss us out on our ass.

## That's moronic. Why would a bit player impress a backer?
Look, how many times can I say I'm sorry? I blew it! I thought she was rich.

## Does she have room for me?
Honey, you made it! I wasn't sure you got my message.

## I see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here. Say, who's the lug?
That's Tony McCoy. He's playing Lieutenant Dick Craig.

## Oh really? How much money did he put up?
None. But his dad gave me fifty grand.

## Eddie, what's my motivation?
Oh. Er... well you're the file clerk. You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.

## But what's our relationship? Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
Dolores, I got five days to shoot this movie. Quit kidding around.

## Did you really mean those things you said..?
I'm tired of living on the fringe.

## I understand you just moved here?
Yes. Hollywood is oh so exciting.

## Perhaps a small amount of money. How much do one of your motion pictures cost?
For this one, we need $60,000.

## Hmm. Those sound kind of small. Oh, here's one that looks good, Janet Lawton. I'd sure like to play her.
Oh my, this is very interesting. Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?

## I don't know. Hey Bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one?
Sorry to bother you while we're shooting, but the guy who owns the stage needs his money.

## Yeah. Well I need the other sixty-thousand.
Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?

## What other sixty-thousand?
The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.

## Wood? Ward? Wood. Hey, what do you know. It is Wood. Dang secretaries, you can never get a good one. Right?
So what are you bringing me? Looks like you got some film cans.

## Yeah...?
Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check.

## Oh! Our church has the money for one film. We just don't have it for all twelve...
Hmm, so you're in the picture business?

## Absolutely! You see this script..?
\"Graverobbers From Outer Space\"! It's money in the bank.

## Graverobbers from what?
From outer space! It's science- fiction. Very pay my back rent from the profits.

## Da pleasure be mine.
Oh, you wanna talk about the \"big picture\"?! How 'bout that the policemen arrive in the daylight, but now it's suddenly night?

## Tor. Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
Mm, not good-lookink enough.

## I like. When do movie shoot?
Hopefully, very soon. I'm just awaiting the final okay from Mr. Feldman at MGM.

## Really? Was the third act too intense?
No. She tink Lobo is waste of my time. Lobo don't talk.

## Yes?
Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you.

## Oh. Um, I'm Ed Wood! So, what are you working on now?
Yes, I'm Ed Wood. I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.

## Is there a script?
Fuck no! But there's a poster.

## Are you a fruit?
No, no, not at all! I love women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.

## So you're not a fruit?
Nah, I'm all man. I even fought in WW2. 'Course, I was wearing ladies' undergarments under my uniform.

## Isn't he dead?
No, he's not dead! He lives in Baldwin Hills. I met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture.

## OUR picture?
Uh, yeah. Our picture.

## Why would Lugosi want to be in a sex-change flick?
Because he's my friend.

## Yeah? Whatever. So did you like it?
Maybe it needs special handling.

## What are you making?
Booties for my father. He gets cold in this hospital.

## How long's he been here?
This is my thirteenth pair.

## He's better. Thank you for asking. How's your friend?
Not good...

## So have you always lived in L.A.?
Sounds like you lived in Grovers Corners.

## Did you find it boring?
Nah, 'cause I had my comic books. And I read pulp magazines. And I listened to the radio dramas...

## A few years ago, I actually saw him do \"Dracula\" live. I thought he was much scarier in person.
What do you mean?

## Does this mean you don't like sex with girls?
No! I love sex with girls.

## Ed, this spaghetti sauce is delicious.
Okay?

## What was that?
The sun.

## I don't understand. Do you want my autograph?
No. I think my film is perfect for you.

## It's uncanny.
Look... would it be possible to make the \"Ghoul's Wife\" a little less prominent, so people won't really notice me in the movie?

## So don't take it too seriously. We're all doin' great work.
What's uncanny?

## The set doesn't look right! It looks too... empty. Clutter it up. Put a skeleton in the corner. And what's that thing over there?
I don't know.

## Wow, this lab looks great. Except why is there a stove and refrigerator?
We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.

## Nah, it'll work. Where's Bela?
Ed, you said you were getting permission.

## So how long have you known Eddie?
Ed, I got the Lugosi lookalikes outside.

## ...Do you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior?
I do.

## Don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing?
I suppose. It's very expensive.

## What are you, an angora wholesaler?
No, I work in pictures. I'm a director-actor-writer-producer.

## You shouldn't be embarrassed by the truth. Mind if I order some hotcakes...?
Eddie, I'm just a small-town girl. I've never done this before.

## ME?! No, uh, I'm just a transvestite.
Who?

## No, no! I like girls. So how 'bout Friday?
No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.

## At what point?
Yeah. I brought you some movies.

## Anything good?
No, I intentionally picked out a lot of crap 'cause I don't like you.

## What do you love her or something?
Come on...

## Who?
Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...

## Yeah, so... ?
They celebrated the common person.

## Have I ever said a bad word to you about your father?
No.

## Hank was always good with the ladies. Always good-looking. Hell, he's been dead for two days, he still looks better than me.
How's your mother?

## What?
So if it's a show and they have a guy die that's writing, but if it's real and they have a guy die that's murder.

## You think she really likes him?
She doesn't give a shit about him.

## What?
If Ray would steal this girl from Ed. That would be great.

## Oh, see, studying would've been a huge help. Where were you, then?
Ed, can I see you a second.

## Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?
Sure.

## Isn't this getting kind of pathetic. I mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel. Let it go!
What if Shari's the dream?

## Where are you going?
I've got this great idea. We put together a video. \"The Network Executives Goofiest Moments.\" And listen, i've really loved working here.

## Yes?
I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down.

## Thank you. Can I see her?
I ... don't know. I ...

## No. The deceased is ... Henry Pekurny.
Who?

## What?
Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...

## You know who we are?
Tell me.

## Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.

## Oh -- so I'm just, what -- a poor substitute?
Yeah. Honey, if you're watching this is for you.

## Eddie? ...
What?

## Are the TV people with you?
Yeah. The camera guy is here.

## Do you want us to come in the kitchen?
No. It's a mess.

## I don't want to -- do you know where he is?
No. Maybe he's watching. Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl.

## How's Marcia? She all right?
I don't know. She's living with that \"entertainer\"...

## Yes to me or yes to the coil?
Chicken pox? I was six. He didn't leave 'til I was twelve.

## But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
She could've been a nurse.

## Could've been a nurse?
She had white shoes.

## What's the difference?
What do you think. I mean about... him. Should I just... have nothing to do with him? I mean...

## Mom?
I'm at the hospital.

## Oh God. What hospital?
St. Joseph's.

## What happened?
It was horrible. He called me up.

## What?
The doctor said you were having sex.

## Apparently, neither can Hank. What the hell did you do to him?
Everybody's making audition tapes for that Real TV thing.

## No, I understand. That's - where is she, is she all right?
No.

## What is she, at work?
She left.

## Well, when will she be back?
She won't.

## Hm? I'm, uh... Why isn't this drunken woman you?
No, I mean...

## What does this mean?
Never would be plenty.

## You batted or you bunted?
Hey, Lou.

## Are you sure about this?
Hey, believe me -1 know I've got a great chance of making a fool of myself, here.

## Cream rinse?
Dynamite.

## So?
So maybe this is my dynamite.

## Oh... how come?
I mean bad.

## Really?
Yeah.

## Really?
Me too. I mean I'm going out with Ray and I'm... thinking about you.

## Really?
Oh God, this is so weird.

## What are you doing?
I missed you.

## The what?
You know, the big machine that cleans the ice.

## It's quite an honor. Will you come with me?
Oh -- Sunday is good for me to meet your folks. We get a big family audience on Sundays so it works out.

## Why?
He could give me some oxygen.

## What?
I told you. If we... you know do it, they go away until ... we're done.

## ...if this ... ... weren't here... ?
... yeah, then, but...

## So...?
Look at this.

## Ed?
I tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to Atlantic City.

## So?
So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita.

## Where?
Somewhere.

## Are you all right?
Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.

## ...yeah?
No. If I quit I don't get the balloon payment.

## The what?
Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides...

## What?
Everybody's someone.

## What did you do to your hair?
My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut.

## Where were you?
I was... having dinner with Shari and her parents.

## What?
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.

## What are you drunk?
What is?!

## You're in show business?
Yeah. I service video equipment.

## What?
I'm doing all right.

## You're gonna be a video store clerk for the rest of your life? This is your big ambition, rearranging the \"Ernest\" movies?
Screw off.

## How many opportunities are you going to get in your life?
I don't know.

## No. What happened?
That's our sister. She's got a new boyfriend.

## Marcia's living with a singer?
Yeah. You know, piano bars. plays the piano and sings. That's how they met.

## Oh, Jesus.
I mean my question is what was she doing in a bar in the first place?

## While I'm gone, tell them about our cousin Lenny who's gay. We knew from when he was five.
Remember the last guy she got involved with? What was his name?

## Who is it?
It's me, Ed.

## You watching the ballgame?
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.

## Next thing you know! Why didn't you stop?
Stop? I'm a guy. I don't stop. The woman's supposed to stop. We're the gas, they're the brakes.

## ... Ray?
I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.

## Oh, is Shari here? Why didn't you just say so? Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired?
Hi, Shari.

## Mr. Pekurny. I'm sorry to bother you. My son would just love to have your autograph.
Who's Shari?

## No problema. You want a picture?
No -- keep it.

## Who is it?
It's Ed.

## It could be, if you fixed it up. How did you... ? I mean how does anyone ... wind up like this?
I was in jail.

## The whole time? Eighteen years?
No. Ray sat on it. I'11 see you.

## What?... Why?
Hi.

## Are you busy tomorrow night?
No.

## Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay?
Sure.

## Can I help with anything?
No. It's going to be about a half-hour.

## Good?
Mm.

## What happened? You described this \"crazy-kooky\" family who'd be a million laughs on TV?
We don't have foibles.

## How?
For instance... me and my friend Bucky are buying out my boss. His equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear.

## What does that have to do with... ?
If they keep Ed on for one full month, he gets a balloon payment.

## What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this?
Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.

## In love?
Yeah, it's serious. I mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has. She even wants to read my novel.

## what?
Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.

## What kind of person?
Thank you.

## Anything wrong?
Everything's fine. Just, you know, school.

## How'd it go?
Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.

## You guys have fun?
Yeah. No. I mean, you know.

## What?
Well, Sherry's great. But she can be a little much sometimes.

## Having a problem with your eye there?
I'm not supposed to tell. Not until you've counted too. We're each supposed to make an independent count.

## Larry, we're not electing the fucking Pope here. Just tell me who won.
You're kidding, right?

## Mr. M.?
Huh. Okay. Well, I guess I'd better do my count.

## Yeah?
I think we've got a problem.

## Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
You know what they say about the early bird.

## Okay. But we're still missing something key here. What are we missing?
I know.

## 6,30. How do you know what time the posters were torn down?
Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it? Whom should we \"interrogate?\"

## What do you mean?
Act surprised. Walk slowly to the podium. Be modest. Thank them for this incredible honor.

## So what brings you here?
I'm looking at new cars.

## Huh. Right. College. Wow. Where are you going? Where 'd you get into?
Sporty.

## Where to?
Anywhere you want. Just so long as we're not gone more than a half-hour.

## Handles pretty good, don't you think?
Yeah.

## Coming to see me. Are you trying to. . humiliate me?
Well, I... I... that's very nice of you.

## What's this?
My house.

## Would you sign it for me?
What a surprise.

## Jim, where the hell have you been?
Nowhere. I don't have class until second period.

## Hmm?
Walt needs to see you.

## You wanted to see me, Mr. M.?
Just wait outside. Tammy.

## Okay. But is this about the posters?
Possibly. Please just wait outside.

## What is it. Tammy?
I'm the one. I did it. I tore down Paul's posters.

## And when did you do it?
This weekend.

## Exactly when?
I don't know. Yesterday. Sunday.

## And how did you get in the school?
Door was open.

## After Dave got fired, Sherry kicked him out of the house and filed for divorce.
Which door?

## Without Dave around. Sherry needed a lot of help around the house.
Your novel? Are you fucking kidding me?

## Here?
More this way.

## Should we get a what?
points at the motel.

## Shall we give it a name?
Dave.

## All his life. He's tried everything.
Did you know Dave's a bed wetter?

## Still clear?
Take me to that motel. Like you wanted.

## Right now?
Easy, tiger. Come by after school. I'll leave Darryl with the sitter.

## What do you want, Jim?
You're there.

## And she's super-nice
What do you mean?

## Sorry. My figures work out exactly the same as Jim's. 256 for Paul, 255 for Tracy.
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?

## And 290 \"disregards,\" right?
I'm not like you.

## What...?
I'm not a dyke, okay, and we're not in love. We were just... I was just experimenting.

## What?
People can see this.

## So?
These are private -- these are for us.

## We can't both run, can we? We're brother and sister. Can we?
I mean at you.

## For what?
I don't know. You're her brother you should know.

## Okay, Mr. Popular. You're on.
Who put you up to this?

## Way to go, Tracy! Isn't this exciting?
Yeah.

## Paul, will you sign my yearbook?
Sure, Tracy.

## Yes, Paul?
Have a great summer. And good luck at college.

## What do you want?
Oh. Hi, Tammy. I was just, you know, I went to all your teachers and got your assignments.

## Now could you leave me alone?
Sure, Paul. No hard feelings.

## What's it to you?
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan. I like your style.

## What do you want, Mr. Policeman?
You got a brother up in Folsom. I know because I put him there.

## You wanna get me a fuckin' snitch jacket?
You wanna buy your brother ten years...? You don't have to say anything. Just look at this list and point. Here.

## That obvious, huh?
It's practically stamped on your forehead.

## Somebody hit you?
It's not what you think.

## Can I get you a drink?
Yeah, plain scotch.

## No I haven't. Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
You use words like that, you might make me mad.

## Yes. But do you know?
Yeah I know. Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side. He doesn't want any attention.

## Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?
I don't know. I never heard of the Nite Owl till today.

## Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.

## How'd she meet Patchett?
Tell me about Patchett.

## You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
It's Lynn.

## I remember you from Christmas Eve. You have a thing for helping women, don't you, Officer White?
Maybe I'm just fucking curious.

## There's blood on your shirt. Is that an integral part of your job?
Yeah.

## Do you enjoy it?
When they deserve it.

## Did they deserve it today?
I'm not sure.

## He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?
No. I'm really a brunette, but the rest is me. And that's all the news that's fit to print.

## Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?
I don't know.

## It doesn't matter. All they get is Veronica Lake. You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken... Where'd this come from?
When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother. I guess I got in the way.

## Do you like being a cop, Bud?
I used to. What I do now is strong-arm. Sitting duck stuff... No, I don't like it. If I could work Homicide like a real detective...

## Did you talk to Exley?
Come in out of the rain. In the morning we'll have both our stories for breakfast.

## How'd you get to know so much about him?
Come in out of the rain, Bud.

## You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
We talked.

## This business, Captain?
Say goodnight to your friend and join me by those back tables.

## Does that paper say we've been indicted? Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off?
He made his play amd he got what he wanted. They're making him a detective.

## Captain, what do you want?
Call me Dudley.

## Dudley, what do you want?
Yeah, I hate them.

## It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him. Why the loyalty, Wendell?
Wendell, I want you to come to work for me.

## Doing what? Mowing your fucking lawn?
They're yours. Take them.

## I knew you had juice, but... There's no goddamn bill on me?
Four of the defendants recanted their testimony.

## How'd you get them to retract?
Give me one minute.

## What work?
You lost me, Dudley. I don't know what you're talking about.

## You know him?
Seen him around. He used to be a cop.

## Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory. Want to grab a beer?
Rain check me, partner. I got something big going on tonight.

## What? That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
No. I'll tell you sometime. Not now. Don't want to jinx it. But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming.

## What are you talking about?
Mrs. Lefferts, I'm Officer White with the L.A.P.D. I'd like to ask a couple of questions.

## What was that boyfriend's name?
We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day. She called him by a nickname. Muns or Lunts or something.

## Stens? Was it Stens?
Maybe. I don't know.

## Easy. Tell me about the ruckus.
You said a neighbor heard a ruckus. Was it outside, inside?

## Was it... a rat?
Yeah. A great big one.

## It's a surprise. You like surprises, don't you, White?
Yeah, that's Stens.

## What happened?
Someone held up a coffee shop, panicked and killed six people.

## A naked guy with a gun? You expect anyone to believe that?
Get the fuck away from me.

## How's it going to look on your report?
It'll look like justice. That's what that fat fuck got. Justice.

## Why?
Lynn.

## Stensland and Meeks. What were they up to?
The Nite Owl! Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.

## It wasn't the Negroes. The Griffith Park report was a phony. And, who says the purple Merc was spotted outside the Nite Owl?
Dudley.

## What?
Stay smart, Bud. We build a case. We play by the rules.

## With a wrecking ball. You want to help me swing it?
Let's go see Pierce Patchett. Run a good-cop-bad-cop.

## You expecting problems?
Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle.

## What about him?
Jack thought he was up to his neck in all this.

## You wanted to meet here?
Me? You called it. I got a message that...

## You figured this was a set-up? And you showed up anyway?
A lot of bad stuff happened here. It's as good a place as any for it to end.

## Are you Pierce Patchett?
I am. Are you soliciting for police charities? The last time, you people called at my office.

## I was here, hosting a party. Who was killed and why do you think I can help?
Richard Stensland.

## You know I do or you wouldn't be here. How did you find me?
We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve. This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.

## Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder?
No.

## Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?
That's right.

## Why were Lefferts' eyes black?
I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket. She is -- was -- a big doubles fan.

## Wait. Our deal still holds?
I needed a Rita Hayworth to fill out my little studio.

## What little studio?
That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.

## Of course... this is personal with you, isn't it, Mr. White?
Officer White. I heard you got a hard-on for wife beaters.

## Wendell White, how's tricks, paesano?
I ain't your paesano, you wop cocksucker.

## What do you want, officer?
You remember an ex-cop named Buzz Meeks? He works for a guy named Patchett.

## Should I?
His file listed you as a known associate. Now spill.

## How 'bout I give you your balls back?
Before Meeks disappeared he was popping off about trying to move eighteen pounds of heroin.

## Bullshit. Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
Deuce Perkins. Mickey C's narcotics lieutenant. The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing.

## Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?
I got a few Nite Owl questions.

## What do you want to know?
Anything off. Anything that didn't make sense.

## Whose shoe?
Susan Lefferts.

## If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way. What are these smears in the blood?
It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.

## Dick Stensland. Had to be dumb panic. If she knew him she would've been sitting with him... Right?
Cotton balls. I found them just inside the meat locker door.

## What do you mean?
It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...

## Ed, your observations have been astute. What's your assessment of this situation?
I want to know who we give the public in contrast? The department needs role models. Clean-cut, forthright men the public can admire.

## Clean?
More or less.

## Anything?
Nothing.

## You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray?
Say what and so what.

## That fucking Larry. I almost believed him.
Did one of the officers work you over a little?

## Nothing, Ray. That Larry, he's a pisser. You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you?
Man, why're you talkin' about Larry? His business is his business.

## Ray, you protected Ty and Larry up in Casitas, didn't you?
You ain't woofin' I did. Stupid down home niggers got no more sense than a fuckin' dog.

## Man, what're you saying?
Ray, we got the shotguns.

## Say what?
I got nothin' more to say till I see a judge.

## Were you on hop? You were passed out when you got arrested. Were you hopped up, Ray?
Ty and Larry fuck with that shit, not me.

## I don't want a floor plan; I want to know who! Who's taking the ticket for this, Johnny?
Nobody. At least not yet.

## And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
Gone. Not a trace.

## It's for your own safety. Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes?
Trashcan Jack. The Big V. I can tell you he's on the Night Train to the big adios.

## Alright. We'll drop that line for now. Next topic. Please comment on Pierce Patchett.
But you were business associates?

## And what?
Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgeons, is the key to all relationships.

## The youngest applicant by eight years.
And?

## You'll make lieutenant inside a year. Patrol division?
I was thinking Detective Bureau.

## Am I...? Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?
Dudley, we've been over this.

## Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty?
No.

## You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department?
Yes, Dudley. I am.

## Why?
We got a call earlier on three Negro youths. Firing shotguns in Griffith Park from a late-model purple Mercury Coupe.

## No... Where'd the tip come from?
Anonymous. Probably nothing.

## Why?
And now you'll provide them.

## Why not, lad? Absolute justice?
Something like that.

## Really? Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis?
John, I doubt you've ever drawn a stupid breath. Don't start now.

## You think golden boy can handle it, Cap?
I think you'll be surprised what Edmund's capable of.

## What's this all about, lad?
Part of it has to do with a murder. I've been working with Ed Exley on it.

## You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?
It's a private investigation. I fucked something up and I want to make amends.

## Have you discussed this with anyone else, John?
No.

## You're the key witness?
That's right.

## Yeah, Exley. What's the payoff?
You're the payoff expert. I'm just doing my duty.

## What about you?
I'm snitching three old timers who'll be fishing in Oregon next week. Next to you I'm clean. And smart.

## What?
Glasses.

## Damnit... What?
I want you to follow Bud White.

## Yesterday yes, today no. What happened last night?
Transfer me, suspend me. Just leave me alone.

## You make a mistake?
Yeah. My whole life.

## What?
It's a simple question.

## So what's the point?
I'm trying to figure what angle you're playing this time, but I sure as hell can't see one.

## What's that for?
Bud White. He sees us and we're dead.

## Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on?
Movie star hookers. Whatever you desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again.

## What's Fleur-de-Lis?
Yeah. But first I want to brace Stompanato.

## What?
She is Lana Turner.

## What are you going to do?
I'm going to Lynn Bracken's. I'll meet you at the Dining Car.

## What's on the call sheet?
A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz. Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.

## Decorated?
With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.

## Of his penis, sir?
We got a total of forty-five spent 12-gauge Remington shotgun shells. Three men with five-shot-capacity pumps. All of them reloading twice.

## The Nite Owl. Anything bothering you about the case?
Yeah. The fact that you guys won't let it get filed away.

## What are you talking about?
Bud White grilled me on it this morning. You know, he's not as dumb as I thought.

## Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores?
A vulgar term, but yes.

## What's her name?
Lynn Bracken.

## Anything else you want to add before I talk to her?
No.

## Really? What did White say?
He said you were smart. He also said you were competing with your dead father. How did he put it? Trying to measure up to a ghost.

## Why?
It galls you that I know so much about you. You don't have information to compete.

## How was I?
Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.

## I want to know why you see him. Is it a Patchett payoff?
I see Bud because I want to. I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.

## Does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier?
I don't hate White. I really don't. It's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for.

## You cut to the heart of things, don't you? What about Lynn Bracken? She going to be a hooker all her life?
I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality.

## Because you'll use it against me. Won't you?
You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.

## You, me and White, huh?
Actually, Bud's only tough on the outside.

## Forget everything else for a second, Lynn. Is there anything you can give me on Dudley Smith?
A police captain. I think he's behind all of this.

## Where will you go?
Bisbee, Arizona. The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is.

## When?
Right now, before I back down.

## Do you think I ever could've been in the running?
Some men get the world. Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.

## On what evidence?
The proof had his throat slit. So far you're not denying it.

## What's Dudley's scheme?
It seems like my Susan, but...

## When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts?
At Christmas. We had fought. I didn't like her boyfriend. I -- she has a birthmark on her hip.

## Officer White?
A sweet man.

## Big V Jack Vincennes! May I have this dance?
Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from Hush-Hush magazine.

## You lost me, Sid. Who?
Yeah, it's subtle.

## Something good?
Not a word.

## Sid, how are they hanging?
Down around my ankles.

## You tight with the D.A., trash?
Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke.

## Where'd you hear that?
Around.

## What happened with the kid and Loew?
You didn't get my message? It got called off. The kid chickened out at the last minute.

## Loew didn't go with him. You're sure?
I put Reynolds in the cab myself. The night cost me a hundred scoots and I got bupkis.

## Have we met before?
Yeah.

## Was it a party?
Something like that.

## Pierce isn't like regular people. I dig him, but he scares me too.
Oh, I know. A Fleur-de-Lis party, right?

## Really? How?
You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.

## And no one'll know about this?
It'll be our secret.

## Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
Yeah, Cap. Back in Narcotics.

## Oh? Anyplace else?
Working whores with squad two.

## Brill?
Brill's dead. He died of small pox when he was two and he was buried in a Kansas field. My name doesn't matter.

## What happened?
DePinto's dead.

## They found him yesterday folded neatly in a car trunk. What about Zavitz?
I don't know anything about Zavitz.

## What'd he say to you?
Nothing.

## What'd he give to you?
Nothing.

## He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
Nothing. Two nights later I was robbed. I'm pretty sure they were pros.

## Someone else?
Maybe you bumped into someone who took it and you didn't even know.

## So...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
I don't want any money. And believe me, I have no interest in ruining your life. I'm not interested in this tape.

## You've got it on tape?
Clear as day.

## Who else have you told?
No one. But I'm a little nervous.

## When can you get it here?
I'm doing a transfer now.

## Why?
They want to hold you in Contempt for ethics violations.

## It is?
Tell us about Rachel Banks.

## What kind of a question is that?
A direct one.

## Told by whom?
Considering the enormous exposure to which you've subjected this firm, I'd think you'd do best to simply answer my questions.

## Really?
Yes.

## Who was that other guy?
One of many people who would live a word with you.

## What do they have to do with this?
That's who they are.

## The NSA?
Yes.

## You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339?
Yeah.

## What is that?
It's a SAT-tracker.

## Why are they after me?
If I knew, they'd be after me. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.

## Wait. What do I do?
Pal, you're cooked. It's over. What you did, who you were...that's done. I'd find a quiet job somewhere shoveling snow.

## Why don't they just identify themselves and tell me what they want?
They're spooks.

## How many years have you been hiding from them? How many years have you been running? What'd they do to you?
If you find something, chalk the Baltimore Sheraton mailbox and go to Temperanceville. It's South of Salisbury. And take this.

## What do you mean?
I didn't use my name.

## What'd I tell you?
You told me no calls.

## How do you know so much?
None of your business.

## You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
I was a traffic analyst.

## How'd you get around the tap orders?
How'd you have the manpower to--

## Why'd you leave?
It was '72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to Ramparts and split.

## They come after you?
Well...there'd be too much disclosure to prosecute me. So they ruined my records and made sure I'd never hold a real job again.

## What do you think?
Looks like Detroit.

## It really is. Did you find anything?
Yeah. Take a walk with me.

## Remember when Senator Hamersley died in an accident up near Shenandoah?
Yeah.

## Jesus. Do you have proof?
Well, actually, you have proof. Could you walk a little faster please.

## What's going on?
They're here.

## Who?
Them.

## Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. And turn your head. There might be some debris flying your way.
Where?

## Gimme that.
Why?

## You sure?
You're driving.

## Think we let out enough air?
Oh my God...

## We're honest people and we need your help. I'll give you two- hundred dollars if you--
Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?

## So what do we do now?
I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.

## What if we hand deliver to their homes or office?
The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be looking for those moves.

## How?
Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.

## You wanna get caught spying on Albert?
No, I want the NSA to get caught spying on Albert.

## How fast can you learn?
Pretty fast.

## Shit.
What do you know about locking cellular phone signals?

## What are you dialing?
He came in four minutes ago.

## Feeling lucky?
Not particularly, no.

## Who's calling?
It's Pat Cary. I work for Senator Sam Albert and I was given Jerry's name.

## --Don't think it could've gone any better. Tell me, how's Deb? How're my grandchildren?
A receiver tuned permanently to the Senator's phone.

## Well then who can?
Most of this stuff's only available to law enforcement.

## Law enforcement?
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.

## Are you sure about this?
I yanked this off your RV. It's a Global Positioning Tracker.

## With what?
With spy satellites. I don't like saying these things Senator...

## You're a tough nut to crack, Dylan.
Is it okay?

## Do you see anything you like?
I'm married.

## Is that good?
Very good.

## What size?
Eight. Size eight.

## Well, I need to find out as much about Daniel as possible.
Could you give me just a moment to talk to a friend of mine here? Not about this, but...Daniel?

## Why?
I didn't want to bother you during your racquetball game.

## Thanks. Who are you?
I'm sorry. Detective Morelos.

## Your stuff?
The robbery.

## A report?
A police report.

## About what?
About the accident.

## Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?
Somebody took my blender.

## Did he give you anything?
No.

## Anything at all?
No, sir.

## Was he with anyone?
Not that I could see.

## Nobody gave you anything?
No.

## Why'd you go to Harrison's?
To buy lingerie.

## For your wife?
Yes, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.

## I don't know what's goin' on with Zavitz, but that was way, way outa line. You understand?
Just for the criminals.

## You're a lawyer. Don't you care what's going on around you?
Something bad happened tonight.

## What?
I saw a man die.

## What do you mean?
In front of Harrison's, he got hit by a bus. I knew him. The firm did some pro bono work for his organization a few years back.

## What'd you buy at Harrison's?
A toaster. And no terrorist talk at dinner. You're spookin' the kids.

## Bobby?
Yeah.

## Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.
How'd you get the information on DePinto?

## Have you been working with Rachel?
There's just, clearly, some administrative snafu. I'm sure this is the worst of it.

## Stacy, don't hang up.
Stacy?

## Was that doctored-up, too?
Yes.

## Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?
Just reporters.

## Does that hurt?
Well...yeah.

## You opened the thing?
The lingerie.

## What is it?
Oh Christ.

## Are you sure you're safe?
Yeah.

## Is it over?
It's over.

## It's really over?
Albert's gonna get me my job back.

## Who?
My suitcase is gone.

## What can I do for you?
Well, I was hoping you might stop by my office to swear out a criminal deposition against some of your friends and co-workers.

## Is this a fuckin' joke?
I don't believe it is, no.

## Good news there, Mr. DePinto, you're talking to one.
It's not?

## I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand. You wanna fuckin' what?
I'd like to speak to someone about what's happening to me.

## You didn't squeeze DePinto?
No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.

## And then what?
I'll see if I can, you know, work things out.

## How's the trout?
It tastes like fish.

## Do you like fish?
Brill.

## Brill?
Yes.

## Good. You're just what I need right now.
Why?

## You got a minute?
It's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you.

## Who's doing this?
I gotta go.

## You being audited?
For the last four years.

## How?
Tell me about Brill.

## This conversation's over.
I've never met him?

## What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?
I don't have a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man.

## You're a moron, you know that?
Yeah.

## Any idea what he looks like?
My guess is male, somewhere in his 40's or 50's.

## Yeah?
We'd like to ask you some questions about Daniel Zavitz.

## Who are you people?
I'm an investigator with Pro-Tech Security.

## My shoe?
Gimme the shoe.

## And may I ask what could possibly be more important than Fawell Oil v. U.S. Environmental Agency?
I have to go lingerie shopping.

## What's his name?
Brill.

## Who would do that?
She doesn't want to talk to you.

## Why?
Because she's reading the newspaper, you asshole.

## Are those my Christmas presents?
Some of 'em.

## Can I open 'em up?
Sure, go ahead.

## Really?
He's kidding.

## Where's mom?
Having an adventure. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you about it soon.

## Are you and mom getting a divorce?
No. We're never getting a divorce. We were having a fight. It happens sometimes.

## Who won the fight?
Yeah.

## How long can you stay?
I'm not goin' anywhere, Eric. I live here.

## Did they take your clothes?
No.

## You've got a bunch of Armani suits, they didn't take 'em?
No.

## What about jewelry?
They didn't take the jewelry. They took the computers. They took the big-screen TV, they took my blender.

## The blender?
I love my blender.

## They didn't take the silverware?
No, but they took my blender.

## What?
They only took electrical appliances.

## I wrote a check for a thousand dollars. You guys didn't have a table that was in the kitchen?
The Congressman's very happy to have your support, but he's heard that there's an investigation.

## Into what?
Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there might be mob ties.

## Rachel's dead?
Yes.

## To the cops?
To the NSA. Make a deal. Tell 'em to stop. Tell 'em I don't have what they're after. Make a deal.

## Yeah?
Turn yourself in.

## Yeah?
Go fuck yourself.

## Yeah, what's going on?
Dick Burns got a phone call this morning from someone wanting information on you.

## You remember Daniel Zavitz?
Yeah.

## What does that have to do with you?
I honestly don't know.

## Was Zavitz in trouble?
I don't know.

## What is it you want?
Someone's trying to destroy my life, and I'd like to find out who.

## You would?
Yes. But we can't.

## I'm not asking you to say for certain. This is what you're trained to do, right?
Yes sir.

## Then what's your goddam opinion?
Get it.

## It means who's side are you on?
You didn't ask me to meet you 30 miles from my office for a Bible study class.

## What?
I said fuck you.

## What happened?
He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.

## What about the tapes?
We found the originals.

## The originals?
There was a transfer.

## Several indiscriminates and one primary who we've ID'd as Robert Dean. A Crystal City attorney. Mr. Reynolds? Sir?
We'd have to--

## Hiding something?
It was in his bag. Now it's not.

## 30 minutes ago you said we had him. What in hell's goin' on out there?
He had help.

## We believe?
Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.

## What about the tape?
We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now.

## And if it wasn't?
Found him. Kent Island nailed the call five minutes ago. He's stationary.

## Do you have visual?
Not yet. He's near \"M\" and 34th. I've got an ELSUR unit on the scene now. A residential building. Twelve units.

## What's your ETA?
Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.

## Yes?
Federal Express for 'Zavitz'.

## Federal Express?
For Daniel Zavitz. I just need a signature.

## How'd you get in the building?
The door was open, sir. I just need a signature.

## It was pulsing on your SAT frequencies.
The fuck do you have goin' on with Sam Albert?

## Puffed cheese?
No.

## Now is that clear?
Yes sir.

## How much did you pay?
Hello! Good morning.

## Excuse me?
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.

## I don't believe that. I think you are insulted by me, somehow. You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market?
Excuse me.

## Excuse me?
After the market, you followed me to the hotel.

## What do you mean, poetry?
A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear.

## What is he saying? Come on, what did he say?
He said - be careful.

## Her or me?
Actually, you sing.

## Pardon?
You sing. All the time.

## What's this?
I thought you might paste them into your book.

## What am I looking at?
See what's happening to them - the stars.

## This is not very good, is it?
No.

## Shall we be all right?
Yes. Absolutely.

## Of course. Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
Find that plant. Cut out its heart.

## And the marriage - is that a fiction?
No, the marriage isn't a fiction.

## Do they know them?
No, but I think I do.

## Will you not come in?
No.

## Will you please come in?
Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.

## When were you most happy?
Now.

## When were you least happy?
Now.

## What else?
Marmite - addicted! Baths - not with other people! Islands. Your handwriting. I could go on all day. My husband. Almsy nods.

## A lie. What do you hate most?
Ownership. Being owned. When you leave, you should forget me.

## This is - what is this?
It's a folk song.

## Arabic?
No, no, it's Hungarian. My daijka sang it to me.

## I don't care to bargain. It's full of saffron, just in case you think I'm giving it to you to encourage your sewing.
It's beautiful. What's it about?

## That day, had you followed me to the market?
Of course. You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.

## Shall we be all right?
Yes. Yes. Absolutely.

## Is he next? Do you drag him into your little room? Where is it? Is this it?
Don't do this.

## Dance with me. I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine. Which belong to me.
You know why? He tries to hold her. She resists

## Katharine! Oh dear God, Katharine - what are you doing here?
I can't move. I can't get out.

## Why did he bring you?
A surprise, he said.

## Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
Don't talk.

## Shall we be all right?
Yes. Absolutely.

## A broken car?
Still a car.

## What kind of photographs?
It's Geoffrey under this.

## Yes, of course. So, golly, where have you come from?
I desperately need a jeep. There's been an accident.

## What?
If I could just see some identification.

## Right. And what's your name, sir?
Count Laszlo de Almsy. The Officer is writing this down. A glance at his Corporal.

## What did you think you were doing in his tent?
Looking for the fossils. Why should we wait until we're in London? This girl was probably twelve years old.

## What did you do?
I looked at them. They're shrubs, small trees. Exquisite. And fossilized, rock hard. He walks away to the nose of the plane.

## And where are the Expedition Maps?
In my room.

## Why do they care about our maps?
What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears. In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.

## When's Clifton picking you up?
Tomorrow afternoon. Don't worry. I'll be ready.

## How are you?
Okay.

## Is this you?
I don't know.

## Well, you must know. You were brought up Libya, yes?
Don't cut me.

## Or was it Toronto?
Don't cut me. Come on.

## What do you want?
Bonjour.

## You were in Africa?
Yeah, for a while.

## So you can shoot a pistol?
No.

## Where've you been?
Rabbit hunting.

## You should be happy. What were you going to do for him when it ran out? He pulls out more phials from his jacket.
Can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life?

## Hana? Hana? Are you alright?
Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.

## Who are his ghosts?
Ask him.

## What? How could he have? When?
I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know. It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk.

## Where did you find that?
I liberated it.

## Hello.
No-one should own music. The real question is who wrote the song?

## Finally! So you're our Canadian pickpocket?
Thief, I think, is more accurate.

## I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?
Oh, all over.

## Are you planning to be the exception?
Me? You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy. So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name.

## Is it you? If I said Moose I look different, fuck, why shouldn't you?
Moose.

## First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
I don't know. Paper. Is it? Paper? I don't remember.

## For?
Top Hat.

## Is there a song you don't know?
Hana tells me you're leaving.

## There are going to be trials, they want me to interpret, don't they know I'm allergic to courtrooms?
We shall miss you.

## Me?
I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name.

## And you thought you'd come and settle the score?
You were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing.

## What did you say?
The rest meant nothing to me.

## But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them?
Is that what you thought? That I betrayed the British? The British betrayed me. The British betrayed me.

## And did you never see Katharine? You never got back to the Cave?
Yes, I got back there finally to keep my promise. To come back for her. And then of course I couldn't I couldn't even do that properly.

## Oh.
Oh really?

## Darling, I just heard. You poor sausage, are you all right?
I'm fine. I got hot.

## Aren't you?
Sweltering. Come on, I'll take you home.

## What?
Marzipan! I think you've got marzipan in your hair. No wonder you're homesick.

## Marvelous plane. Did you look?
Isn't it? Wedding present from Katharine's parents. I'm calling it Rupert Bear. Hello. Geoffrey Clifton.

## Good heavens, are you married, Madox?
I was repairing the stairs. I found a library and the books were very useful.

## I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes. What about your own book?
Yes. Dropping off.

## How? How can you see anything?
Not the window - I can't bear the light anyway - no, I can see all the way to the desert. I've found the lost fossils.

## Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
Because I'm a nurse.

## Why? Can he lay eggs?
He's Canadian.

## He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him? Do you recognize him?
Do I recognize him? I recognize what he is. I like him. He's Canadian. He can read Italian. He can catch rabbits.

## Why? Is he staying?
With his Sergeant. A Mr. Hardy.

## We should charge! Doesn't anyone have a job to do?
In that case, I suppose we can't charge.

## Good morning. Did you know that? You're always singing?
I've been told that before.

## Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?
Never heard of it.

## Where's your Stuart from? Somewhere near there, isn't it?
Excuse me. Yes? I don't have the key to that door.

## Is something funny?
I've met you before.

## For my hair?
Yes, for your hair.

## So I follow the wires?
You get Hardy.

## Why would anyone do this?
I've done this. I've had to do this.

## What is this business with you and explosives? Do you think you're immune?
I promise you that was the right thing to do. He's my good luck. Now cut. This one. I hope we don't die.

## If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do?
I try not to expect you.

## But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
Then I'd think there must be a reason.

## What are you up to?
I mean home. India.

## Is that what you think? Is that what you think I think?
It's what I've learned.

## The war's over - you told me yourself. How can it be desertion?
It's not over everywhere. I didn't mean literally.

## And what if he really is a spy?
He can't even move.

## He's from there - edge of Lake Ontario right, Soldier?
Third Canadian Fusiliers.

## He's gone, hasn't he?
No. He's - no.

## I'll tell him. What is it? Is it a mine?
A bomb. At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.

## Pardon me?
What if you couldn't find him? Sergeant, not today, please. Not this morning.

## I thought that was for when we were very very old?
I'm feeling old.

## What's happening? Am I needed?
I'm afraid so, sir. Kip hurries to his tent. Hana follows him.

## How awful. What will you do?
Certainly not.

## You should sit down, darling. She's quite all right. Are you pregnant?
I don't think so.

## What are you talking about?
They're excited! They're happy about destroying a whole city. Would they do that to a White Man's City? Never!

## What about your rank or serial number?
No. I think I was a pilot. I was found near the wreckage of a plane by the Bedouin. I was with them for some time.

## Why? Are you German?
No.

## This was your garden?
Or my wife's.

## I think so. Although I believe that to be true of a number of Germans. Might I have a glass of water?
Where were you? I called at 4,30 this morning.

## I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
I don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life.

## So he popped the pane?
Bingo.

## You ordering chop suey again?
Let a thousand flowers bloom. Chairman Mao.

## You got a better idea?
Yeah. Me.

## Why didn't I think of that?
It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.

## How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
I'd need an introduction. From someone he trusts. Someone who owes us a favor.

## Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
We're getting close.

## How close?
I don't know, but close.

## Where are you at least?
I'll send you a postcard. Got to go.

## Gin? Where the hell are you?
I'm in the middle.

## In the middle? You've got the Mask, why don't we have him?
He's on to something bigger.

## Who am I?
That is of no interest.

## Why are we speaking Chinese?
Uh. I'm showing off.

## I can't?
It's sold.

## You have a car?
Uh, yes.

## Are you...okay?
It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.

## Yes. But they don't have a clue. Why would anyone steal my luggage?
Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that's what Roki says.

## Excuse me?
I've got something...

## So what?
So alive.

## Do you mind?
You...you can't.

## No. Why would I be?
Because you young Americans think the world began when you were born. You fall apart when you don't get your own way.

## Are you under the impression that now I'm in some way obligated to you?
Well, no...but...

## We going somewhere?
Possibly.

## You want me to pick up a painting?
Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.

## If I can't trust you to pick up a painting, how can I trust you about the Mask?
It's a test.

## Fine. What do I do?
It's simple. You pick up the painting, you pay for it with this debit card.

## How much am I paying?
I'm telling you it's a forgery. The paint's still wet for God's sake.

## Look on the back. What do you see?
A film case.

## What the hell do I do now?
Up to you. You could tell him the check is in the mail.

## What the hell was that?
Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out.

## You what--?
Motorcycle.

## What about your bags?
I never carry...baggage.

## Where's my bag?
That's entrapment.

## Lose something?
I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.

## Nothing? You don't even lock the door?
I guess I have a more optimistic view of human nature than you do.

## Why are we in separate--you know, separate rooms?
My job, my rules. We've got a job to do. No mixing business and pleasure.

## Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?
In a week.

## Only a week?
They're having a farewell party the last night. Before the Mask goes back to Taiwan.

## We? Are you implying that I'm taking you inside?
We're doing this together. We're partners.

## Don't worry, I can get rid of this. No trace. And I'll even go fifty fifty, we're partners aren't we?
No. It's a down payment.

## On what? Another job?
We get the Mask I'll tell you.

## So you're testing me now?
Oh, I think you can do it. Probably.

## Why don't we take oxygen?
We are...for the tools.

## Did I hear a car?
Our equipment has arrived.

## So how long to pop the floor?
Twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.

## The lipstick thermal camera?
Got it.

## Charged. Receiver?
That's it. We're ready.

## You bought this for me?
Don't get any ideas. Of course it comes out of your share.

## Aren't we early?
Little celebration before we set off.

## You were afraid of heights?
Terrified. Still am.

## How in the devil did you do the Rembrandt then?
I had a lifeline. If I've got a lifeline, I'm okay.

## Let's mingle a little, shall we?
One, two, three...

## Ready?
Ready.

## Can you see the other PIRs?
Got it.

## What?
You're playing both sides of the street. You're going to keep the Mask and turn me in.

## What?
A billion dollars.

## Speaking of money. You said billions. How many?
If you want a partner, I think you should recalculate the split.

## Come on, what can you do with six billion you can't do with four?
Hold the record. Alone.

## The Mask. Where is it?
You took the Rembrandt, I figured it was a fair trade.

## What about the rules?
My job, my rules.

## Well...What are we doing?
You're being useless. I'm making us rich.

## What's that?
Guest lists of every A-list party on turnover night. They'd be handy to disappear into, so we're invited to all of them.

## So how long till we do this?
We're doing it tonight.

## How do I look?
Like a woman of mystery.

## Done. And I assume you have the magic CD- ROM?
Surgically attached.

## No way to take another day or two?
No. You'll see when we get inside.

## You have something in mind?
Of course not. It was just a negotiating ploy.

## So what are you going to do with your share?
Oh, I don't care about the money.

## What? Another job? Stealing the Eiffel Tower?
I'm going to disappear. I die in a car crash in Taiwan. Very easy to do.

## You mean the seven billion.
What about you?

## A true master. Classic, yet extremely sexual, don't you think?
We need to make the trade tomorrow.

## The porta power...comm kits...got the IR/Thermo camera?
Had to get a liquid plasma screen.

## You're not the one trying to get all this shit. You think they've just got a Crooks R Us on every corner?
We're going to need a vacuum with a battery pack for the dust. The air filters might be wired. And a bypass hose for the AC.

## Let me ask you, this Mask, when they made it--was the old bitch dead or alive?
It's a death mask. Death mask means dead.

## How the hell I'm supposed to know the damn difference?
You look like George Washington.

## Suspicious, after all these years?
You change partners, you change the rules.

## Tonight your league night?
Check out my ball.

## Doesn't look like much. How come those Commos want it so bad?
It's not just art, it's history. Something you Americans don't care about--because you haven't got any.

## You're impressed with her, aren't you?
She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.

## It's never happened before. What makes you think it's happening now?
You know where my loyalties lie.

## You're giving them to me?
Call it an expression of trust.

## You got a real problem with priorities, you know that?
I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.

## Did I ever tell you what Tina wrote? The night she died?
My friend, you always surprise me.

## That's a joke, right?
Anna? With this real-estate valuing stuff - - could you remind me, cause I'm a little confused about how exactly we do that.

## I'm gonna assume that was meant as a compliment, Anna, and just say thank you.
Where've you been?

## 250,000?
In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr. Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.

## What do you think? What's this?
Tequila. From your drug dealer friend.

## Erin Brockovich. Car accident. Not her fault, she says. And she looks like such an honest girl, don't you think?
You shouldn't judge, Brenda.

## What the hell is this doing here?
It's those files you asked for.

## I didn't mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor. Jesus. Look at me. What do I have this afternoon?
Nothing you can't show up for with a stain.

## All of 'em?
All of them.

## Yeah. There's two. Why?
So. You must've been feeling pretty desperate that afternoon.

## What's your point?
It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain.

## How does someone get meningitis?
Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ...

## Hell, no. I hate lawyers. I just work for them. You got a minute?
This is a real nice place you got here.

## Wow. Why would they do that?
Cause of the chromium.

## The what?
The chromium. Well, that's what kicked this whole thing off.

## What's chromium?
It's a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there.

## And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
Yeah.

## Sure wish I had longer to get used to the idea. You think if you got no uterus, and no breasts, you're still technically a woman?
Sure you are. You're just a happier woman, cause you don't have to deal with maxi-pads and underwire.

## For what?
Well, I was gonna head over to the Browns now. I was thinking -- Mandy really values your opinion ...

## A number for the whole group, or for us?
Both.

## Five million dollars?
Five million dollars.

## ... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person, a decent citizen. Just wanna take good care of my kids. You know?
Yeah. I know.

## Okay, look. If you really want to apply for a job here, you can do it the way everyone else does. Send in a rsum, make an --
Open and shut? Open and fucking shut?

## Yeah?
Out to lunch with the girls.

## You do know how to do that, don't you?
Yeah. I got it. No problem.

## Excuse me?
How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl.

## What are you doing here?
I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.

## Well, that was nice of him. Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax?
Look, I'm sorry. You were gone. I just assumed you were off having fun.

## Now, why in the hell would you assume that?
I don't know. Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun.

## So what's the story on this thing? This cancer stuff?
You wanna know, you gotta hire me back. I got a lot of bills to pay.

## But, PG&E told her about the chromium?
They told her something, but it can't have been too specific, cause I talked to her, and she sure didn't think her water was bad.

## So what made you think it was?
It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.

## The ones in the box of files. The box of files? The one from your office?
I didn't see any medical records in there.

## That document you found, the one that says it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen to make a copy did you?
Course I did.

## Lemme see it, will you?
I want a raise. And benefits. Including dental.

## This is the only thing you found?
So far. But that place is a pig sty. I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.

## So you think we got 'em scared?
It sure as hell sounded like they were sitting up and taking notice.

## What, you think I'm made of money?
Mr. Masry, Mario gets lost going to the bathroom. They'll be driving around the valley for hours.

## Hunh-uh. Absolutely not.
Yeah. Isn't that a shame?

## That's crazy -- why not?
It's not about working hard --

## How many families we talking about here?
Four more. Eleven people. So far.

## You think there's more?
This is a whole different ball game, Erin. A much bigger deal.

## Kinda like David and what's-his-name?
You're doing the right thing, Mr. Masry.

## Is that what I think it is?
She lived on the plume. You never know.

## And that's what caused the contamination?
It didn't help, but no. The real problem's on the bottom.

## What do you mean?
PG&E corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.

## You didn't care about my case?
I would now.

## Boy, this job takes me to some of the best damn places, huh?
Someone's following me.

## What? Who?
Some guy in a truck -- he waited till I was alone, then he followed me, like, two miles. Jesus, I'm shaking. Get me a beer.

## What kind of truck?
I don't know. Big. Dark.

## I was just asking. Are you all right?
I want my paycheck. By the end of the day.

## What kind of things come up?
Things like the head counsel for PG&E calling me with an offer. 20 million, plus attorney's fees. Take it or leave it.

## So what are you thinking?
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.

## Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.

## Holy shit. Who do they represent, God?
Don't joke. They might. So do me a favor and behave yourself for once. Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter.

## Don't give me that. You've gotten plenty. You've been well-paid; you've gotten lots of perks ...
What's a demur?

## Perks? Jesus -- perks?
If you're here to fire me, your timing's lousy.

## Between 50 and 400 million, definitely?
Uh-huh.

## Wait, what do you mean, ten years?
Five years, maybe, for a trial. Double that for the appeal.

## When? Where?
Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse.

## Why not?
Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you. He thinks you're a loose cannon.

## How do you know that?
Cause you got a little voice in your head saying, do the right thing. Give him another chance.

## You see your office?
Yeah. Yours is nicer.

## Here what comes?
The extortion, the threats ...

## What is that?
Take it.

## Two million dollars?
The firm took in sixty. That's three percent. Seemed like a fair bonus to me.

## When'd they file the demur?
Yesterday.

## How many counts?
Sixty-nine. We've got good answers to all of 'em.

## Who's the judge?
Corey.

## Did he say why?
Nope. And I didn't ask.

## Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding -- you gotta find some way to entertain your mind. So yeah, I took a look.

## And you were told to destroy those?
That's right.

## What do you mean?
Well. There were a few documents that I somehow didn't get around to shredding. That I kept instead.

## How come you didn't say anything when you found these things?
Oh, hey -- lemme give you a hand there.

## Erin. Cool. What can I do for you, Erin?
Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records.

## Pattee? That your middle name?
Nope. Maiden.

## Hey, Ross. Tell me something. Does PG&E pay you to cover their ass, or do you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
I don't know what you're talking about.

## Harmful, like -- how? What would you get?
So that stuff -- it kills people.

## Hunh-uh. What's that?
Every county has one. They keep records of anything water-related within their jurisdiction. You should be able to find something there.

## Mommy, can I get a flower?
Sweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch.

## What are you doing? Where's George?
You've been reading for hours.

## What's going on in there?
Some meeting. With PG&E people.

## PG& -- Are you sure?
Yup. They must be important, too, cause they came on a special plane.

## Yeah, I'm gonna start sleeping here. Masry & Vititoe, can I -- damn it. Does anyone know anything about these phones?
There's no way a son of mine hates Funky Town. It's impossible.

## Can I play roller hockey?
We'll see.

## When?
Randy's mom said yes right away.

## God damn it, Matthew. What the hell are you doing out here?
I'm gonna go live with George.

## She's one of the sick people?
Yeah. She is. But you know what? That's why I'm helping her. So she can get some medicine to make her feel better.

## How come her own mom isn't helping her?
Cause her own mom's real sick, too.

## Whose number do you need?
Everyone's. This is a lawsuit. We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs.

## I said, whose number do you need?
You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.

## What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise?
Just introducing myself to the neighbors.

## You want my number?
I do.

## You got more than one?
Shit, yeah. I got numbers coming out of my ears. Like, for instance, ten.

## Ten?
Sure. That's one of my numbers. It's how many months old my little girl is.

## You got a little girl?
No.

## Why not?
Cause I don't even know you.

## Yeah, and whose fault is that?
Yeah. I'm probably ruining them.

## How?
I'm never here. I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.

## Yeah? And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?
I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap.

## Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
It's been a while. Maybe I'm just out of practice.

## Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
Cause I like kids. I like hanging out with them.

## You're around every afternoon?
Yup. Usually working on my bike. No big deal. If it doesn't work out, you can send 'em back to the chicken fat lady.

## What're you doing?
Better safe than sorry.

## What are you doing here?
Fixing a leak under your sink.

## What kind of person lives like this? Huh? What kind of person lets her kids run around in a house crawling with bugs the size of housecats?
You're not nothing, Erin.

## George, I am just trying to do something nice for my kids on my one day off. Could you please not give me a hard time about it?
One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else.

## Look, don't take this the wrong way, but don't you think you might be out of your league here?
It doesn't have to be this complicated, Erin. There's a lot of jobs out there.

## You mind telling me what that's supposed to mean?
Nothing.

## Cause I can get a job. I will. And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again. Would that make you happy?
Keep your voice down.

## No, no jokes, I gotta pee. Just tell me about your day. What went on back there?
Well, come to think of it, we did have a big event around here. Beth started talking.

## I'm bored, and so are the kids.
What? Beth? My Beth?

## I'm just saying -- we have one night to ourselves, why do we have to spend it here?
Cause it's my office party. If you had an office, I'd go to your party.

## What's going on? What are you doing?
Thinking.

## About what?
About this.

## What's that?
I'm sorry. I'm just working so hard --

## You already packed up your stuff?
I pretty much knew what your answer was gonna be.

## Hello?
Hi. It's me. I got a favor to ask you.

## They up?
Hunh-uh. Not yet. Look, don't take any of 'em on your bike, okay? Call a cab if you wanna go somewhere.

## How long's this whole thing gonna take?
I don't know. Few days. Thanks for helping me. I appreciate it.

## Think you could learn?
You know me. I pick things up real fast.

## What time is it?
Real early. We're just gonna take your car to get some breakfast.

## What do I look like, Erin? A library?
Someone stole my stuff.

## What am I supposed to do, check in every two seconds?
Yes. It's called accountability.

## What?
I moved payroll onto the computer. It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night.

## Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not in here most mornings and nights?
You're clever. I'm sure you'll think of something.

## Yeah. Who are you?
When Donna told us about you, and what you told her about the chromium, we figured that might have something to do with this, too.

## What?
I know. It's an awful lot.

## Outside with the sprinkler. So it's good?
My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me. I'm going to move in with her.

## You're moving away? When?
Next week.

## ... and when I realized our area's just as bad as Hinkley, I thought maybe my neighbors are all sick too. So I went and asked.
Is this a joke? Did Baxter put you up to this?

## You did?
I gotta say, Erin -- first time I saw you, I did not peg you as the kind to go off and conduct her own epidemiological study.

## The Emperor?
Yes, he commands you make contact with him ....

## Will he finish what he begins?
We've come this far ... He is our only hope.

## How you doing, Chewbacca? Still wasting your time with this clown, eh?
Growls a reserved greeting.

## What's wrong with him?
Three patrol ships are heading our way.

## Why don't we just turn him over to Lando to fix?
Barks at Han.

## Not now, Chewie. Lando, aren't you afraid the Empire might discover this little operation and shut you down?
Barks his concern.

## What happened?
Howls.

## Oh, a Jedi Master. Different altogether. Yoda you seek, Yoda.
Can't get your ship out? Have you tried? Have you tried?

## You know the Jedi Master?
Of course, yes. But now eat we must. Good food, I have good food. Come, come.

## Not far, not far. Be patient. Soon you will see him. Why wish you become a Jedi?
Because of my father, I guess.

## Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet?
I haven't seen him. He probably came in through the south entrance.

## Not likely! Where are the speeders?
We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...

## What is thy bidding, My Master?
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.

## Our destruction? Who?
The son of Skywalker. You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.

## Captain Solo. What's the situation?
There isn't a hint of life in the area. But all the perimeter markers are set, so you'll know if anyone comes calling.

## Good, and Commander Skywalker?
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.

## I shut it off. What's her royal holiness want?
She is looking for Master Luke, and assumed he would be here with you. No one seems to know ...

## I don't know, Artoo. Sir, might I inquire what's going on?
You, too, golden rod.

## You said you were going to stay. What happened?
That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.

## Does Luke know?
Han, we need you here.

## We?
Yes.

## Not you?
Me? I don't know what you mean.

## And what are they, pray tell?
You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.

## And you think you're the one to apply some heat?
Sure ... If I were interested. But I don't think it'd be much fun.

## What was it?
Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It must have had a self-destruct ....

## Come on, your highness, are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss?
Why you low-down, stuck-up, half- witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder.

## Would it help if I got out and pushed?
Don't worry, your holiness, I'll get her started.

## I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what?
Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.

## To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
Aren't I? Hang on, sweetheart. We're gonna do some flyin'.

## What is it?
That should do nicely.

## How do I look?
Beautiful.

## Where have I heard that before?
Easy, your worship. Only trying to help.

## Would you please stop calling me that?
Sure. I guess I make it difficult sometimes.

## What are you afraid of?
Outside, in the cave.

## You could have warned him before you shut him off.
No lightspeed?

## Oh, so sorry! Didn't mean to offend your droid. You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.

## That depends. Where are we?
Here ... near the Anoat system.

## Can you trust him?
No. But he has no love for the Empire, that much I know ...

## Who's staring?
You look silly.

## Has Threepio turned up yet?
I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.

## Chewie, do you think you can repair him?
No thanks.

## Loud and clear, kid. What's up?
I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.

## Probe? What probe?
That makes a good story. But I think you just can't bear to let me out of your sight.

## About what?
Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.

## Are you kidding?
I always said you were a gentleman.

## That won't be easy, my friend ... What brings you here, anyway?
Repairs ...

## That ship saved my life a few times. It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy. What's wrong with her?
Hyperdrive.

## How's your mining operation going?
Sorry friend, I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.

## All this just to get the kid? What's so important about him?
Don't ask me, but he's on his way.

## What about Leia and the Wookiee?
You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.

## Hello! What have we here? Welcome, I am Baron Lando Calrissian, Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?
You may call me Leia.

## Sorry, am I interrupting anything?
Not really.

## Would you care to join me for a little refreshment?
.... We are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire.

## You're part of the mining guild then?
It's a lovely outpost.

## What about Han?
I didn't know you had a price on your head. Vader has given you to the bounty hunter.

## What's going on?
I'm coming over to your side, that's what. And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.

## And when do you betray us again?
Look, I stand to lose everything by this.

## I didn't say anything?
Luke needs help. We must go back.

## Are the coordinates set?
I'm sure my men fixed it. We've got nothing to worry about.

## Is there any chance of them surviving out there?
Slim, but yes, there's a chance. They have a shelter. It's not much, but ...

## Have they analyzed the one that was killed?
Not yet. They're working on it now.

## What is it?
Two transports at a time is awfully risky.

## Sir, we've lost the rear deflector shield. One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.
What?

## Well, what now?
Rather touchy, aren't they.

## The Bacta are growing well. The scars should be gone in a day or so. Does it still hurt?
I'm fine. Really. Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.

## Where are you going?
I have this ... feeling. I'm not sure, really ...

## What are you talking about?
First Han, now you. When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ...

## Han's leaving?
Calm down, will ya? Tell me about Han.

## Jabba the Hutt?
I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.

## Lando, is he alright? ... Lando? Are you there? How's Luke?
He'll survive.

## Why not me?
To become a Jedi takes the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.

## Size has no meaning. It matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size do you?
I don't believe it.

## Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
No, no. Easier, quicker, more seductive.

## But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
You will know. When you are at peace ... calm ... passive. A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense. Never for attack.

## What's in there?
Only what you take with you.

## Ben? Ben?
Free your mind and return he will.

## Foreknowledge is helpful, but painful sometimes and dangerous too. You have far to go in your training.
Will they die?

## Yes, yes. To Obi-wan you listen young one. The tree. Remember your failure at the tree! Heh?
I've learned so much since then. And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master.

## And sacrifice Han and Leia?
If it must be. Yes.

## The Hoth System?
Yes, Sir .... we have visuals ... the System is supposed to be devoid of human forms ...

## Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
It won't get through the blockade.

## Me, too. Can't have a lot of monkeys making messes in the Guardhouse. Have we fed them? Like raw steak or something?
The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees, like all apes, are vegetarian, sir.

## Excuse me. I didn't mean to disturb.... What am I saying?
They're...pretending to dress.

## What d'you mean, pretending? They are dressing. Where'd they get those clothes?
So am I. And I mean you no harm.

## Do you have a name?
My name is Cornelius. And this is Zira -- my wife.

## Believe what?
That primitive apes can talk.

## Zira, are you mad?
Dr. Milo, please don't call my wife mad.

## What, Lewis?
There was a sort of carpetbag in the ship.

## With food?
No -- clothes. Stevie, they changed into them.

## What are they doing here?
Security. Join the Marines and see the Zoo ...

## Humans?
I'm a psychiatrist.

## C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's phony, you know that.
May I say something personal?

## You never heard of Snake Plissken?
He doesn't look like his picture. I bet he's fake.

## Cuervo...?
You're my woman, you understand? You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight.

## Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you. Understand? Understand?
Yes...

## Where is he?
THE STARS EDDIE He jumped. Down there. He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed Plissken.

## Where?
THE STARS EDDIE Oh Cuervo...

## What?
THE STARS EDDIE It's so good to see you again.

## Where's Plissken?
THE STARS EDDIE He's... near.

## Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we gonna go? What's the payoff?
I'd like to get out but I don't have enough money.

## My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you understand, cowboy?
I need a favor.

## What's in it for me?
Wait a minute. I know that voice. You're Carjack Malone.

## I see your point. What's the favor?
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.

## So what's the deal, gorgeous?
We get the girl and the prototype. And we get out.

## No, that sucks. How are we getting out?
I don't know yet.

## You assholes didn't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service. What'ya want?
Shut up, Plissken.

## What's the little black box do?
Top secret. Only on a need to know.

## So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
That's the deal.

## Having second thoughts?
Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time.

## So what does this thing do?
All you need to know is get it back here by 5 a.m.

## So you want me to take her out? Is that an order from the President?
Let's just say it's what's best for the country.

## By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
A medical team will be standing by.

## Not you?
No.

## Plissken...?
I'm here.

## Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the prototype?
Yeah, I got it.

## Got a smoke?
The name's Plissken.

## Does he know how to activate it?
Well, yeah. All you have to do is push the button.

## Where'd they go?
THE STARS EDDIE Man, I'd love to have your autograph, Snake.

## Where are they?
Location.

## Delgado?
Stop the damn car.

## Where is it?
THE STARS EDDIE Right over there.

## Where are they going?
THE STARS EDDIE Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me, Snake. I can help you.

## THE STARS EDDIE Sure, Snake. No problem. You gonna kill me?
Later.

## How do you know all this?
THE STARS EDDIE I used to represent the guy who invented it. I swear to God, Snake. No bullshit.

## THE STARS EDDIE Me too?
We'll see.

## THE STARS EDDIE I got an idea, Snake. This looks like the prototype, right?
Yeah, kinda.

## Is that what I think it is?
THE STARS EDDIE Yeah. The place kept changing owners. Finally went bankrupt. That thing in Paris killed 'em.

## What're you doing in here?
Looking to get out.

## Which way?
Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns? Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours.

## Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
All the sewers are collapsed under Venice. You have to go topside. Right up there.

## Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
Down that way.

## Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake.

## Where?
You ain't doin' so good, Snake. You need help. You should talk to Hershe. She hates Cuervo. They used to be partners, but they split up.

## Who?
Hershe. She lives downtown with Mojo Dellasandro in the big boat. Down that way.

## Are you crazy?
A little bit. But pretty soon I'm gonna be dead. So are you, Snake.

## What are they?
No screamin' shit.

## Who?
The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.

## How do we get out of here?
Sewers. Come on.

## Snake - what is it?
How the hell am I supposed to know? This is your damn city.

## Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat to China, take an airplane to Brazil? Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?
I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.

## What the hell is this?
The freeway.

## What are you gonna do in Venice?
Find Cuervo Jones.

## Who?
I can see you're real concerned about your daughter.

## Where's the anti-toxin...?
Give me the prototype.

## Hey, what's going down, Snake?
I'm looking for somebody.

## Who ain't?
You owe me. You left me holdin' everything back there in Cleveland.

## Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
Yeah. With me and Texas Mike O'Shay.

## All of us?
Yeah.

## Is he coming?
He heard Lady Guenevere's request and he said nothing. That is all.

## When you threw it in, what did you see?
...I saw nothing.

## I am King, and this is Excalibur, sword of kings from the dawn of time. Who are you, and why do you block the way?
--That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility.

## Lancelot, how did you fare in the North?
We spared the lives of a few, so they could sail home and tell their fellows what fate they met at the hands of King Arthur's knights...

## Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?
It is deep...

## Of Merlin?
Speak of the devil!...

## Whose son am I?
In the great book.

## What book is that?
What?!

## Come now. So much anger for such a little crime? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you?
You know full well there is, and I go to meet it now. Come witness my revenge.

## At your service, sir.
Excalibur! Is it true?

## Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?
Never where you expect it, that's all I know.

## What is it my child?
Yes.

## I didn't ask for poetry. Which is it?
That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too...

## I must do it myself. I must kill them both. Lancelot and Guenevere. Will you ride with me, Merlin?
I cannot. I must not. Here I must stay.

## What is this place, Merlin?
But, I'm here.

## Your mother told you that?
I cannot offer you the land, only my love...

## You freed it, son?
I did, Father. I beg your forgiveness.

## Who is, then?
He is the mightiest and fairest of knights.

## It didn't hurt too much, did it?
Ye...

## --And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.

## Why can't you be my champion?
If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.

## Who does it serve?
You, my lord.

## I have waited long for you. Once you almost saw, but fear blinded you. Why am I served from the chalice?
Because you and the land are one.

## Why?
I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.

## And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
There is one.

## Me?
Yes. I would swear my love to you.

## To me? But why?
He has given up.

## Twenty days!? The world is that big?
I have found you. The Queen. An apple. Tomorrow. Sir Gawain...

## Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
It is.

## Can it truly be used for magic?
No, no, of course not. You are young...

## People make you laugh?
They do.

## Talk. Lovers murmuring to each other...
Why?

## I should butcher all and every one of them. Merlin, what is this wagging of tongues?
Just show the sword.

## I?
The child is mine, Uther. I have come for him.

## To kill and be king, is that all?
You strike me with words as hard as steel.

## Well why are they tearing the building down?
Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.

## What honey?
Fuck it.

## And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?
How about Lankaster Merrin.

## What's he doing there? Teaching?
No, he's working on another book.

## Don't you think he's too old, though? How's his health?
It must be alright. He's still running around digging up tombs. Besides, he's had experience.

## You'd want to do the exorcism yourself?
Yes.

## Hi, how'd your day go?
Oh not to bad, kinda like the Walt Disney version of the Ho Chi Minh story, but other than that it was terrific.

## Oh great, anything else?
And you got an invitation.

## What's this?
Dinner at the White House.

## Your kidding me. What is it a big party or something?
Just five or six people.

## Why don't you let me?
What the hell do you mean going out and leaving Regan by her self! What are you kidding her window's wide open...

## Didn't who tell me?
Burke.

## What's Burke got to do with it?
Well, when I went to get the Thorazine I had him to stay with her and... Oh, I should of known better.

## What did the doctor say?
We have to start looking for a shrink.

## This was under Regan's pillow. Did you put it there?
Of course I didn't.

## What is it?
Phonograph.

## Does your daughter remember if perhaps Mr. Dennings was in her room in her room that night?
No, she was heavily sedated.

## It's serious?
Yes, I'm affraid it is.

## May I ask...?
We still don't know.

## You were expecting a deliver y that day?
Not that I know of.

## Groceries maybe? A package?
I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that.

## Want to ask him?
Never mind.

## Would you like some more coffee?
Please.

## I know that. I realize. But if a certain British doctor never asked \"What's this fungus?\" we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct?
When she's well enough, I'll ask.

## Of course. Have you got a pen?
Oh, she'd love it.

## What's her name?
I lied. It's for me. The spelling is on the back, Kinderman. You know that film you made called Angel? Isaw that six times.

## Rats?
Uh huh. 'Fraid so.

## But it's clean?
No. It wasn't me. I didn't.

## A man to see you.
Excuse me Miss?

## Excuse me Madame? Will there be anything else?
No thanks Karl.

## How are you today?
Fine thank you.

## Is it coming out Willie?
Yes, I think so.

## Why the math?
It affects concentration.

## What is it? A tranquilizer?
A stimulant.

## Depression?
Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.

## Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
Oh no. I'd wait and see what happens with the Ritalin. I think that's the answer. Wait two or three weeks.

## Lies?
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.

## Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil.

## You're kidding! Like what?
Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.

## She used those words?
She used those words. Look, I doubt that she even understood what she was saying.

## Yeah, I guess. Maybe not. You don't think a psychiatrist-?
The best explanation is always the simplest one. Let's wait. Let's wait and see. In the meantime try not to worry.

## Convulsion?
The shaking of the bed, that's doubtless due to musuclar spasms.

## So, what causes this?
Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder.

## What was going on in there, how could she jump off the bed like that?
We still think the temporal lobe...

## Do you keep any drugs in your house?
No. Of course not, nothing like that.

## Are you sure?
Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass.

## Chris MacNeil?
Please go away.

## So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?
It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.

## Where?
Harvard, Bellevue, John Hopkins.

## You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?
Yes am.

## Pretty close?
Pretty close.

## Did he tell you about my party?
Sure did.

## About my daughter?
No I didn't know you had one.

## He didn't mention?
No.

## Didn't tell you of what she did?
He didn't mention her.

## Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
That depends.

## On what?
The priest.

## If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?
Well, the first thing I'd do is put them into a time macine and send them back to the sixteenth century.

## I didn't get you?
Well it just doesn't happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil.

## Oh yeah, since when?
Yeah well, it just so happens that somebody very close to me is probably possessed, and needs an exorcist.

## Why, I don't understand?
To begin with it could make things worse.

## But how?
Yes I could, I could see her as a psychiatrist...

## Like what?
Like her speaking in a language that she's never known or studied.

## What else?
No.

## Did you know my mother died recently?
Yes I did, I'm sorry.

## Not at all. Why d'you ask?
It's not important good night.

## What do you drink?
No it's alright I'll take it straight.

## Are you sure?
It's fine really, sit.

## Where's Regan's father?
In Europe.

## I told Regan that was holy water, I sprinkled some on her and she reacted very violently. It's tap water.
Have you told him what's happening?

## What's the difference?
Holy water's blessed. And that doesn't help support a case for possession.

## What?
She killed Burke Dennings. She pushed him out of the window.

## Is she gonna die?
No.

## What did you do today?
Um........Stuff.

## What kind of stuff?
Well, me and Sharon played a game in the back yard, and we had a picnic down by the river.

## Really, what kind was it a mair or guilding?
Think it was a guilding. It was grey. Oh it was so beautiful, the guy let me ride it all around.

## Your kidding?
Well, not while we're in Washington.

## When can I have one?
We'll see Regan. Now about those party invitations.......

## You like it?
Oh it's so funny.

## Hey, where'd this come from?
I found it.

## You've been playing with it?
Yeah.

## You know how?
Here I'll show you.

## You really don't want me to play huh?
No I do, Captain Howdy said no.

## Captain who?
Captain Howdy.

## Who's Captain Howdy?
You know, I make the questions and he does the answers.

## Regan, why are you reading that?
Cause I like it.

## Okay. And tomorrow night, I'll take you to a movie, okay?
Oh I love you.

## I love you Rags. We'll have a good day yeah?
You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.

## Mr. Dennings?
Well you know it's okay.

## Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?
You like him.

## Your not gonna marry him are you?
Oh my god, you kidding, me marry Burke Dennings don't be silly, of course not.

## Where'd you ever get an idea like that?
But you like him.

## Do you not like him like daddy?
Oh Regan I love your daddy. I'll always love your daddy. Burke just comes around here a lot because he's lonely, don't got nothin' to do.

## Oh you did. What did you hear?
I don't know, I just thought.

## How do you know?
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.

## Why does God let us get tired?
God gets lonesome for us, Rags. He wants us back.

## What are you doing here?
My bed was shaking, I can't get to sleep.

## Over behind the church, you know where I mean over there, it's a red brick wing?
St. Mike's.

## What goes down there? I mean who's the priest I keep seeing, he's there all the time. He has black hair and he's very intense looking?
Damien Karras.

## So what's next?
A pneumoencephelogram, I would think, pin down that lesion. It will involve another spinal.

## Where'd you get the money for the Chivas Regal? The poor box?
That's an insult, I got a vow of poverty.

## Where'd you get it then?
I stole it.

## Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
No, I tell fortunes by reading the crease, now shut up and go to sleep.

## Lieutenant?
I came to say goodbye.

## How's the girl?
She seemed fine.

## Do you like films?
Sure.

## I get passes. In fact I got a pass for The Crest tomorrow night. Would you like to go?
What's playing.

## Who's in it?
Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the role of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball.

## Another one. Had your lunch?
That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras.

## Where's Regan?
In here. With us.

## If that's true, then you must know my mother's maiden name. What is it?
What an excellent day for an exorcism.

## You'd like that?
Intensely.

## But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
It would bring us together.

## You and Regan?
You and us.

## Did you do that?
Uh Huh.

## You speak Latin?
Ego te abslovo.

## Quod nomen mihi est?
Bon Jour.

## Quod nomen mihi est?
La plume de ma tante.

## How long are you planning to stay in Regan?
Until she rots and lie stinking in the earth.

## What's that?
Holy water.

## How's your leg?
Your Uncle John stopped by to visit me.

## Oh really, when?
Last month.

## Is that too tight?
No.

## Dimmy, you worry for something?
No momma.

## You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
Momma, I'm all right, I'm fine, really I am.

## Why?
There's only one.

## Why this girl it makes no sense?
I think the point is to make us dispair... To see our selves as... animal and ugly... To reject the possibillity that God could love us.

## What is it?
Her heart.

## Can you give her something?
She'll go into coma.

## Have we met?
No we haven't met, but they said I could tell; that you looked like a boxer.

## Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?
Always.

## You this director was doing a film here, Burke Dennings?
I've seen him.

## You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
From the psychiatric end.

## I know. I read it. These desecration's in the churchyou think they have anything to do with witchcraft?
Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.

## And Dennings, you read how he died?
Yeah, a fall.

## You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?
Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.

## Sick priest, is that it?
I don't know anyone who fits the description.

## Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?
No I probably wouldn't.

## Is that a threat?
No, I mentioned it only in passing.

## Hey, Father? You like movies?
Very much.

## Who's in it? Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx. You're happy?
I've seen it.

## Answer the question, Father Paranoia.
One last time, Can you think of some priest who fits the bill?

## Who?
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.

## Yes?
We want to see Mrs. Karras.

## Just a minute.
Do you have an appointment?

## Are you comfortable Regan?
Yes.

## How old are you?
Twelve.

## Is there someone inside you?
Sometimes.

## Who is it?
I don't know.

## Is it Captain Howdy?
I don't know.

## If I ask him to tell me, will you let him answer?
No.

## Why not?
I'm afraid.

## If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you. Do you want him to leave you?
Yes.

## You wanted to see me, Charlie?
Yeah, come on in.

## What's this?
Your pay.

## What about tomorrow?
We don't need you, Frankie.

## What're you saying, Charlie?
Look, Frankie. You and Jack been playing here, a long time.

## So?
So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other.

## Trunks?
Swimming trunks.

## Nothing's the matter. Is it, sweetheart?
I'll take her inside. You too, little Frank. Out of the pool.

## You bring trunks, Jack?
Honey ...

## Where are our kids? Has he got one of them in there?
Frank.

## What's our friend's problem?
Teeth.

## What's wrong with them?
They're falling out.

## How many?
Five's my guess. Maybe more. Won't know till I get in there. Leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning.

## How will he eat?
Start him out on cottage cheese. If you've got him on kibble, just soak it a few minutes. Go down like pudding through a hot pipe.

## No bones?
No bones.

## What do you do to him?
Don't worry, Mr. Baker. We'll knock him out. He won't feel a thing.

## You the magician?
No.

## Oh. What do you do?
Piano.

## Two at a time?
My brother and I. One each.

## What's wrong with the kid?
Knee. Tore it up against St. Anthony's. Right before the accident.

## Accident?
The fire. The way we're going we'll be lucky to buy a carton of jockstraps, let alone a new gym.

## You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
A little stiffer, but just as sturdy.

## Recognize these two characters?
Oh, look at you two. So skinny. And those tiny suits ...

## What happened to the two Clays, Willie?
Out.

## When they coming in?
Wednesday next. Frank looks across the room at Jack.

## What's the gig?
Two nights.

## Am I late?
That's not the point.

## What's the point?
You cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, Jack.

## You want me to show up late a few nights?
Jack.

## What's wrong with it?
You look like you just crawled out of bed.

## You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know. How long has it been, Jack?
Twenty-eight years, Frank.

## That's a lot of water under the bridge, eh, Jack?
Lotta water.

## Count it.
Don't make trouble, all right?

## Huh?
Count it.

## You mind telling me what that was about in there? Was that planned? Or were you just bored and decided to get creative?
Fuck him.

## So we on tomorrow night?
Maybe Thursday. I hear the harpist at the Sheraton's got appendicitis.

## She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. How do you explain that?
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.

## What d'ya got?
Yamaha white. Nice.

## What do you think?
Try the black Knable.

## Really. You sleeping?
Only on odd days.

## Why the interest?
I'm not seeing anyone. In particular.

## Funny. Strike a bell?
It's only a ring. Not a collar.

## Says who?
Your older brother.

## So what'd we get her?
You'll see.

## What do you mean?
Her hands. Like that.

## What's with Charlie?
Nothing. Everything's great. Terrific.

## Yeah?
It's me.

## Yeah. Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.

## What're you talking about?
Something came up. Don't worry, Charlie stayed true. Both nights. I'll give you your share tomorrow. At the house.

## So you'll come out, right?
Yeah, okay.

## What?
The trees. The flowers. Nice.

## Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?
I don't know what you mean.

## No?
No.

## What was it like?
Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right? I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal. There's no shame in it.

## That how you see it?
A gust of wind killed him.

## Hey, you weren't there. Right?
Look, can we forget last night? We gotta talk.

## We agreed that if I took care of the business; I'd be entitled to the extra. Isn't that what we agreed?
I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.

## What's that?
You, Frank. All these years you been telling me we're different. We got novelty, Jack. No one can touch us.

## What?
Thirty-seven girls. And not one who can carry a tune. That must be statistically impossible.

## What are you, crazy?
I just thought we should talk about it. Between ourselves.

## What's the matter?
I didn't get her number.

## Where the hell is she?
It's early.

## Just like the day of the auditions, right? Jesus. How's my hair?
Awe inspiring.

## How about these?
Jack, for crying out loud. Your bachelorhood's showing. Ah, here we go.

## You all right?
Yeah, fine.

## So what do you think?
Very realistic.

## Yeah, well, what can I say? Dad must've had forty pounds on me. Jesus, you remember him being this big?
Yeah.

## When's the last time we played a wedding, Jack?
Two years ago. March.

## First night?
Day. Wednesday.

## Last?
Sunday.

## I'm putting my stuff on the right, okay?
Okay.

## You leaving that on?
Yeah.

## All night?
Yeah.

## We're gonna be here a week?
Yeah.

## I don't know. I mean, I always did it as a kid. I figured it was no big deal. Is it? A big deal?
Accommodate? I don't think I know what you mean.

## Christ, can't you hear it?
No! I never hear it! Maybe. Sometimes. I don't know. But I won't let it bother me.

## Doesn't it matter to you?
Because I can hear it.

## What?
I love you. I just wanted to say it.

## What's the matter with you?
I'm sorry, Frank. All that talk about family. I just got emotional.

## What the hell are you doing?
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm tuning a goddamn piano.

## How's it coming?
Fine.

## Half-hour. Once I finish this octave I'm gonna get breakfast. You see what's on the buffet?
Just wonder what she's up to. I never see her. Makes me nervous.

## What're you trying to do? Wake up the whole goddamn hotel?
We were just having a little discussion about morality.

## Huh?
He's with the hotel. I called him.

## What are you talking about?
We had a leak in the bathroom. He fixed it.

## How come I didn't hear anything?
You're a heavy sleeper, Frank. You've always-been a heavy sleeper. Unlike me.

## Celebrating. Join me?
The party's over.

## Right. The Royal. When's the last time we were there?
Couple years.

## February?
April.

## God, the old man would've loved this view, wouldn't he?
Yeah.

## I always think of him on New Year's. How he used to pour us each half a can of beer. Remember?
You always threw up.

## It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
It was just a can of beer, Frank.

## What?
I can't make the tenth.

## What do you mean?
I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.

## What're you doing?
Just until we find another girl.

## You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know. Jack?
Twenty-eight years.

## What's it for?
I don't know. Some disease.

## What disease?
I don't know.

## You don't know?
It's a disease, Jack. We're against it. It's not a moral decision.

## What?
Jack, you're on television.

## What?
It wasn't professional, Jack. It was a stunt. A stupid-ass stunt.

## Dignity? Who the hell are you to talk about dignity?
I didn't hear you come in.

## What're you doing?
Oh ... I was just hoping for something to drink. But it seems the old lady was dry. Not even a bottle of cooking sherry.

## I set it for Wednesday. The ceremony. They're doing the stone today. It's okay? Wednesday?
Yeah, fine.

## How're your hands?
Oh. Fine. It was nothing. Couple sore knuckles. Nothing.

## Yeah?
Yeah.

## Jesus, when was the last time we played the Mallory?
Five years ago. November.

## Right. It was someone's birthday. Halloran?
Daughter's. Sweet sixteen.

## So what'd you think?
Thrilling. Both of you.

## You sure?
Just call me a cab.

## Sick? How sick?
The flu.

## I'm sorry?
Moran. Monica. The whole thing. It's my stage name. My real name's Blanche.

## Candy Man.' Is that all right?
It's one of Jack's favorites.

## This where the auditions are?
This is where the auditions were.

## What do you mean?
We're finished.

## What about me?
You're an hour and a half late.

## This is show business?
Look, miss. We're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.

## Just like that, huh? You're not even gonna give me a chance?
Don't take it personally.

## How should I take it?
Impersonally.

## So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?
Terrific. Thirty-eight.

## Catchy. You have any previous entertainment experience, Miss Diamond?
I'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting here, I just had to come over. Florence Simmons.

## I sing now?
That's the premise.

## So?
Uh ... we'll let you know.

## When?
When we know.

## I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.

## And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster?
We'll talk about it later. Right now, you gotta get changed.

## Am I missing something?
Come on.

## Time for what?
If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.

## Just look. What do you wear? A nine?
A seven.

## Okay, okay. Here, how about this?
Save it for your wife.

## All right, but make it quick. Shoes! What size do you wear?
Nine.

## Big feet.
Nine?

## What do you think?
Uh... good.

## Shoes?
Right.

## Switch? What fucking switch?
Fucking. She says fucking in front of an entire room of people.

## Did you hear it?
Fucking.

## For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it. Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you?
Give me that.

## Jack, you with us?
The Carlton's a dump. No cover. No minimum. And they water their drinks. It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd.

## Well, well. Ho, ho, ho. You moonlighting at Macy's, Frank?
For the kids. Merry Christmas, you two. Don't forget. We leave the twenty-sixth.

## You play all these places?
Baker's unabridged.

## Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise. What's with the stars?
Virgins.

## Virgins?
First times. Hey, look at this.

## Jack?
I don't believe it.

## Of course it smells like fish. We're on the ocean. What'd you expect, Chanel number five?
Smells like tuna number two to me.

## Great?
Yeah.

## Peggy Lee?
Tell her.

## What'd she sing?
People.' You think Streisand, right? Hot that night. Chills. Through the whole audience. I could hardly play.

## Hey, will you look at that?
They must've bought the same map we did.

## What do you say we send a bottle over?
I don't believe it. You're a romantic, Frank.

## What's with you two?
Jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle.

## Got another song for us?
Oh. Yeah. I gotta bunch of them.

## What's with you guys?
I just saw a man walk out of your room.

## Huh?
Forget it.

## What?
That song. I can't sing it anymore. I'm gonna get sick.

## I'm gonna throw up, Frank. I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?
Susie. It's one more show. One more time. That's all.

## Is that important?
Uh, well ...

## Uh ... You don't know when you'll be wanting us back, do you, Lloyd?
I'll call you.

## Yes, sir. That's quite a girl you boys latched onto. She a local?
Born and bred.

## Lucky for you. Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
We trust you, Lloyd. You know that.

## Whatcha doin' over there?
Gotta go.

## How come?
Job.

## Will I see you again?
Brought it.

## So. I'm here, you're here, the piano's here. What d'ya say?
Don't worry about it.

## Barker. Jock Barker?
Baker. Jack Baker.

## You want to know if he's okay. Right?
Black. Labrador.

## Well, now, where's everyone run off to? Frank?
Downstairs.

## And you don't?
He leads, I follow.

## Is that the way it is?
Pretty much.

## You miss him, don't you?
It's been a long time, Ma.

## Hey, he's not sore, is he?
He'll come around.

## You never sang before?
Not for money. With my mother.

## The Park? It's only two nights. Why throw away a night?
Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.

## Where's egghead?
His kid's sick.

## Uh-uh. I never touch American cigarettes. What's tomorrow again?
The Stratford.

## Huh?
Mmm. Like kissing a rose. Well, au revoir.

## Hey. You feel like a cup of coffee?
You kidding? We must've killed three pots in there. Anyway, I gotta get home. Rest the pipes.

## You want me to walk you?
Every year.

## Aren't the kids asleep?
Every year.

## So why's he do it?
I guess in case one year they're not.

## Can't sleep?
In and out.

## Like a baby. You?
In and out.

## Just dinner and dance, right?
Relax. We'll drop the song.

## How do you do it? Every night?
Practice. There are worse songs, you know. Not many, but a few.

## What's the matter?
Nothing.

## What'd I say?
Nothing.

## What's that supposed to mean?
It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.

## Who's Nina?
Friend.

## I have to make him some chili. Okay?
Sure.

## How come you didn't close your eyes?
You know, I saw you guys once. You and Frank. At the Roosevelt.

## Soap?
History.

## Huh?
My father proposed to my mother in there.

## The both of them? In there?
He called her.

## Oh. So what's it doing here?
Long story.

## Nervous?
You're kidding.

## So, what happened?
I don't know. Maybe he thought some rich guy was gonna try and call her.

## Coffee?
Yeah... No.

## Saw the sign outside. Got your own sign, huh?
Yeah. Got my own sign.

## So ... ?
We outgrew each other.

## So how's the cat food business?
Terrific. I'm doing vegetables next week.

## Huh?
Vegetables.

## Ah, you know. Howsa pooch?
Losing his teeth.

## Another five years, huh?
Like clockwork. You got a good memory, Jackie.

## It ain't always a blessing. My brother here?
He's got blood in his eye.

## Did you break a cup, Jack?
Eddie did.

## What happened to the donut king?
Married.

## Is that what you used to do?
My days are not the old days, genius.

## What are they?
The recent past.

## How do you know?
I saw his stuff in the bathroom.

## Oh?
I guess it's getting serious.

## I hope not. He's already busted the springs in two chairs. Hey, what's this?
Ivory.

## Ever go to church?
I tried Cheerios this morning. He didn't even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.

## Okay. How'd yours go?
Not so good.

## Eighty proof. What d'ya say? Think you can handle it?
Jack.

## Can I stay here tonight? Even if she comes here?
Merry Christmas, Jack.

## Fine. You?
Oh, fine.

## Big piece or little?
Huh? Oh, no.

## None?
I'm not much for sweets.

## How's that dog of yours? What was his name?
Eddie.

## Yes. Right. Eddie. How is he?
He's losing his teeth.

## Waxy Wright. Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?
They never should've voted against U.S. statehood -- the scumbags. We heard you got wasted.

## Do I look wasted -- asshole?
You look great, Castor. Really. Here -- I got a shot of your favorite -- Mescal. Even has the worm.

## What did he do?
He hit a guard.

## I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say \"thanks\"?
... Thanks.

## What do you expect us to do -- shut down the city, evacuate two million people on a hunch?
Uh-oh, somebody's in trouble.

## Where am I?
My place.

## How old is he?
Five. No one knows you're his father. I thought someone might want to hurt him -- just to hurt you.

## And this thing can grow it?
Yes. Pollux bought one along with the original batch. Obviously, he found a way to make more.

## Why would he need more?
He's your brother, you figure it out. Maybe he made another bomb.

## What do you mean?
I don't know. Everything's jumbled -- so you're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks.

## A few blanks? Like what?
Like ...

## Uh -- to kill the doctors?
After that. You promised you'd always take care of me.

## What's worse than losing five million bucks?
Being stuck in this rat-hole when it blows. Bro, what you built was a work of art. That little fucker belongs in the Smithsonian.

## For what?
We need to talk.

## Something good?
We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.

## Were you there to catch me?
No.

## How come?
I don't know ... Maybe because you've never needed my help.

## You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie! What could be more important than that?
Eve, listen carefully. The man you think is your husband -- isn't.

## Who is this?
Never mind that! Just take Jamie and get out of that house. Don't tell anyone where you're going -- especially not him -- just GO.

## How did he expect to do that?
I took it from my fake husband.

## What more proof do you need?
Tell me what happened on April 9th -- 13 years ago.

## Our Pacific Rim stations. These numbers must be bounties. Castor's not wasting any time.
Christ, Jon! How could you do this to yourself? How could you do this to us? Do you know -- do you know what he did to me ...?

## What do you mean?
He's going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- one-by-one.

## Jon, what is it?
The bomb. He's reactivated it. And everyone there is going to die.

## Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is \"me.\" We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off.

## How is he?
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.

## Would it?
Damn right.

## How's Loomis?
Apparently, fine. He's coming into work. That's the good news ...

## Which ear was it?
The left, I think. Those surgeons in Witness Protection can fix things nobody's even broken yet.

## Jon, this is goddam insane. You can't go through with it. What about Eve?
She doesn't know -- and she never will.

## Now what?
Call Lazarro. Castor just came out of his coma.

## How is the \"date night\" idea going over with Eve?
Like gangbusters, doc. Okay, I missed the last one.

## You're supposed to make time. When was the last time you told her you love her? When was the last time you two had sex?
One of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.

## You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --
Mention my family once more and you're dead.

## -- Castor?
Not anymore.

## Too late, your kid worships me. And your wife -- she's an animal. Even I can't keep up with her.
What are you going to do, Castor?

## What -- what are you doing?
Vacuum-sealed globe ... shouldn't take long.

## I don't know. How long before it kills us?
Five seconds.

## You'll what?
I'm going to have you fired.

## Pollux is -- what?
SFPD? Castor isn't stupid enough to come back to the city.

## What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother?
I've never been more certain of anything. Get everyone in position. -- And get the word out -- shoot to kill.

## Castor Troy almost strangled me to death. Where the hell were you?
Screw your boundaries, Janie. You have something I want.

## Janie?
Clarissa left those here.

## When did you start smoking?
You'll be seeing a lot of changes around here. Daddy's a new man.

## You mean like ... condoms?
I mean like protection.

## That's your name, isn't it?
You always call me Miss Brewster.

## Let's try to be a little less formal from now on, shall we?
You've got someone in your office.

## Escaped? From Erewhon? I want everyone on this -- our entire force and the SFPD.
The Admiral?

## I can't even look at you without wanting to vomit.
What happened?

## No -- the best part is, since it's a government job -- they can't fire you! But how can you be sure you'll get the appointment?
Trust me. You're gonna love it ...

## What about me?
A lot of people think you're a snitch. It's dangerous ...

## What's that?
Me. I have doubts about your ability to stick with what is essentially a desk job.

## I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?
What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.

## What do you know about it?
As much as ever. Nothing.

## It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
The hospital.

## Don't I usually kiss my wife?
No.

## They say love is blind. Do you think that's true?
I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.

## Isn't that what all this is about? Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment?
I'm replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted.

## What's on your mind?
Jon, it's the tenth. I know how difficult it is for you, but we still have to go.

## What are you doing?
-- Studying.

## Where's Jamie?
That's what I'd like to know. She stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off.

## Wait a second -- you hated Madonna. Didn't you?
You're a ray of sunshine, Jack.

## Her assistant?
Yeah Jack, her assistant...

## You? Married?
Almost married. And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...

## Excuse me?
She didn't want me to go to London. We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.

## So you left her? Just like that?
God, no. I thought about it for practically the entire flight...

## No?! You almost married this woman. Aren't you even curious what she wants?
She's probably just having a fit of nostalgia. You know, lonely Christmas Eve, call the one that got away, that kind of thing.

## Hello?
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybodys here.

## Adelle?
You were supposed to be here half an hour ago...the emergency strategy session? Your trip to Aspen? Theyre all panicked here...

## You think I like being here on Christmas Eve, Alan?
I don't know. Maybe...

## Why Jack?
Because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end...

## You have kids, Jack?
Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones.

## A broker? Really. And now youre in the tire business?
Thats right. And auto supply...

## Really. So youre projecting what, a tad over two million?
Im not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.

## What about me?
...thats our war room. We did seven major deals last year, three of them hostile.

## Excuse me?
But I think I like you better this way...

## Is this another one of those Sun Tzu Art of War tricks?
No.

## Youre jumping, sweetheart...
So what are we gonna do, Jack?

## Mom, dont you think we need to open the presents?
Mommy needs five more minutes in la la land. That could be her present...

## Fightings a part of it, Annie. You know that, right?
Im not worried, Mom. Hes still learning our ways...

## Wheres my real dad?
I dont know...

## Who did?
The aliens...In the mother ship. You look just like him.

## Do you like kids?
On a case by case basis...

## You know how to make chocolate milk?
I think I could figure it out.

## You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
Sure.

## Where do I go now?
Big Eds.

## Big Eds? Big Eds Tires? Why...?
Thats where you work.

## Like what?
One year he had a solar system named after her...

## Dont you think thats a little gimmicky?
Mom liked it.

## Very nice. What is it?
Mary Had A Little Lamb.

## What are you doing?
Ringing my bell...

## Is it morning yet?
No, honey. Go back to sleep.

## I know, I moved the Barca-lounger into the corner. Its throwin everybody off. What do you think?
Great room...

## Were friends, arent we?
Maybe I dont say it enough but you moving in next door to me...

## Trouble at work?
I dont think so.

## Its not Kate, is it?
You see, its like were in each others heads...

## Its just two kids, right?
Hey, Im doing the best I can... Id like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers...

## She said that?
Pretty much.

## Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack. Youre not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
It wouldnt really be cheating... Its complicated.

## Hey, is that really necessary?
All Im saying it there isnt a guy in Union County who wouldnt give his left nut to be married to Kate...

## Its your birthday? Today? Whats your name? Where were you born?
Hey, you cant park that thing here.

## Howd you know my name?
We bowl together. Were bowlers ...we won a championship...were winners.

## Got a minute, Jack?
Ive got all the time in the world...

## There's no way I was gonna die in that deli... Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.
How'd you know my name was Jack?

## A lucky streak, huh?
I don't do that. That's just not for me...

## Everyone needs something.
Wait a minute, wait a minute... you're tryin' to save me?

## Me?
You just said everyone needs something.

## You still think this is about me, don't you?
Sure it's about you. But it's about society, too.

## As long as it takes to figure it out. Which, in your case, could be considerable.
Miss me, Jack?

## Look, I just want my life back. Now whats it gonna take? You wanna talk turkey? Lets talk turkey! How much money...?
Do I look like I need your money. It doesnt work like that and I cant tell you why.

## Look Jack, in my experience the best way people deal with this is to just relax and breathe through it...let it come to you.
Why not?

## But what do I do?
Look Jack Im late. Id love to help you out some more but I gotta go handle my business... Happy trails.

## Like the dress...?
Its lovely...

## Finger food...?
I dont think so, thank you...

## Very funny. I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
Something like that.

## Are we finally being honest?
It would help me if we were.

## Frank. Wheres Alan Mintz? Is he here yet?
Mr. Mintz? I dont think so...buildings closed pal. Youll have to come back tomorrow.

## Do I have a private office somewhere in the building?
Uh...sure Jack... Right back there...

## ...I was the number one junior sales associate at E.F. Hutton in 1988. Did you know that?
No, I didnt...thats great.

## Here we are, mag wheels... Hey Jack, are you sure youre okay?
Well, Im just a little confused right now about why I work here...

## Why dont you let me take this one, Kenny?
Okay, chief.

## Howd you do this year, Tony?
Just until the Deutsche Mark turns...

## All in one tape?
I also put side two of London Calling on there...

## You mean dont go at all? What about my internship?
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...

## What?
Go. Im sorry, you should just go...

## No, youre right. What are we doing?
We're being responsible. Go. Get on the plane.

## Are you okay?
Yeah...fine.

## Where were you?
I was in the city.

## The city? New York City? Why?
Because thats where I live.

## You look forward to this party all year. Whats with you today?
Trust me on this Kate. I really dont think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time.

## What are you doing?
Telling my mother she doesnt have to stay with the kids.

## Why not?
Because youll be here.

## Christ... Where the hell is the bathroom?
Funny, Jack. Im laughing on the inside.

## And...?
Jack. I said the kids are asleep...

## Wait a second. You want me, dont you?
That is the general idea, yes...

## Shouldnt we grab some dinner first? Maybe a bottle of wine...?
Its ten thirty, Jack. By eleven youre gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We dont have time for wining and dining.

## Do what?
Look at me like you havent seen me every day for the last twelve years...

## $2,400?! Are you out of your mind?
She got those shoes...

## Excuse me?
I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva...I drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail...retail, Kate.

## Whats in it for me? Where are my Mary Janes?
Its sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack.

## I think it worked out okay, dont you?
Sure. I really like Annie.

## Charles Street? In the Village? When we were living in Greenwich Village...? Great times. Whyd we ever leave?
You cant really raise a kid in an apartment in the Village...

## You had a heart attack?
Jack, stop that. I'm still mad at you... ...who knows what wouldve happened if you hadnt stepped in at the store.

## Thats why I work for Big Ed?
Our life in a nutshell...

## You mean this chocolate cake?
Thats my piece. I was saving it because I got nauseated from that store bought chicken.

## You want the cake!?
I want it...

## Its good, right?
Say it, Jack...

## What...?
Cmon, you know what I like to hear...

## Not it...?
Nice, Jack. Youre sweeping me off my feet.

## Wait a minute. Youre my wife?
Maybe I should wait...

## Jack...can we afford all this?
Whats the difference? Im taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...

## How do you even know about this place?
You are so not off the hook yet, slick.

## But Im gettin close, right?
I need to tell you something.

## Are you sure?
Worse, you mean...

## And now...?
Now...I dont...

## What are you sure about?
You know champagne makes me do crazy things.

## Im out of the doghouse?
Way out...

## Pretty incredible, isnt it?
Its like a museum.

## So whats the big surprise? You didnt rent this place for the weekend, did you?
Think bigger.

## For the week?
This place is a perk, Kate.

## A perk for what?
A company called P.K. Lassiter and Associates Investment House uses it to attract new executives...

## Are you out of your mind?
I dont think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey. Well put Annie and Josh in private schools...

## I cant believe you want to move back into the city. I thought the reason we left was because we didnt want to raise the kids here?
Jack.

## But Ive done some good things too, havent I?
Youve been Jack Campbell. And thats always a good thing...

## Are you okay, Jack?
I promise, Jack...

## Whats going on?
Im moving to Paris...it was right here... Its a box marked Jack. I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...

## Paris?
Youre moving...

## So youre not at a non- profit firm?
Not with what they pay me...

## Please. Lets just go have a cup of coffee. Thats all Im asking for. Im sure theres another flight to Paris tonight.
Youre not married, are you?

## What do you want from me? You want me to tell you everything that happened was okay?
Dont do this, Jack... But he continues...

## Its because Im shy, Betty. So, when are you going to leave that old corpse Mr. Peterson and run away with me?
You know you could never satisfy me the way he does...

## Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
I need you, tiger..

## Where is he?
Aspen.

## You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
Not by a long shot.

## Do I know you?
Not exactly. Ive seen you on CNBC. You look taller in real life...

## Kate? No, theres no one here named Kate. Is that good enough for you?
Damn...damn...damn...

## Hey, are you okay?
No...Im not...

## Hey, my wifes in the kitchen. You got a cigarette?
Im sorry, no...

## Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?
Of course I did.

## Jersey? You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
I'm taking the train...

## Don't you have anywhere to go?
I've got plenty of places to go.

## Maybe I can try and sneak away some time tomorrow morning... Okay?
If it's something you feel strongly about.

## Do you want me to look for the box or call the airline?
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.

## I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
I'm not really dressed for a party.

## Those yours too?
My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.

## What about his first born?
Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.

## When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
Five times.

## Isn't that your speech?
He's made a few changes.

## Should?
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.

## Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
Solid.

## Are you alright?
I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.

## You got a chisel round here?
If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.

## Where...where am I?
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.

## Reed? ... Sue?
They're fine. Everybody else...is fine.

## Out front? You home, baby? I got a surprise for you.
What's wrong with me?

## Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said \"together forever no matter what\"?
Baby, you're scaring me.

## Oh my G-g-g. What did you...do to Ben?
Deb, it's me. It's still me.

## What did you wish for, honey?
I already got it. Everything I want.

## What are you doing here?
I'm worried about you.

## What is this? Where's Reed?
Where do you think.

## What do you want, Vic?
I'll schedule the launch. Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.

## Is it safe?
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.

## Well why didn't you say so? You want me to lift some weights or something?
You look like an eighties rock band.

## Where is Reed?
Victor must've taken him.

## Now what is up with that?
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.

## Ben, are you there?
This is wrong in so many ways.

## This place is deluxe. You got cable?
...and figure out how to reverse them. Let me show you to your rooms.

## A higher calling like getting girls and making money?
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.

## I mean, you feel a little feverish.
And where do we think we're going?

## What is that thing?
I think that thing is Ben.

## Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.

## Is that what you call it? \"Real\"?
At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.

## And if he's not...?
Reed's always right. Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...

## Leonard, how's the feed?
Recording, sir. We see you perfectly.

## Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar \"humanizes\" you.
How's the IPO?

## Front page?
Top left, like you asked. Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows...maybe Washington.

## This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
Not at all.

## Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
Hilarious.

## Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
Ben did this.

## Ben did this?
He's had some kind of...reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one.

## I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
What I should have done a long time ago. Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.

## Feeling better?
Passion.

## What?
We need to get past them.

## How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
That's what we're here to find out.

## Are you kidding?
No, I distinctly remember, you door. Ergo...

## What are you doing?
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --

## But we're...?
Of course. Of course.

## Reed. How close are we to a cure?
No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.

## You were?
Of course I was. I'd read all your papers on bioethics. Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.

## You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
I gave him twenty.

## Why didn't you say something?
That would have kinda defeated the purpose. And Reed... I'm saying it now.

## Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
I understand the business reasons.

## What are you doing?
Raising the shields.

## Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.

## Skeptical...?
Medical's ready.

## Doctor...without killing him -- how long could we stop his heart?
The less time, the better.

## I know that. But what's the maximum?
In his comatose state...and everything slowed down...no more than sixty seconds.

## What are the problems in stopping the Heart?
That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...

## What're you getting at?
Along the Optic Nerve to the Eye.

## Now how soon can we try Sodium Pentathol?
I'd hold that off awhile.

## Benes... What the devil happened?
The Other Side got to him.

## How bad off is he?
Brain injury.

## -- and why we need you.
Before or after what he wanted to tell you?

## What can I do? Except maybe pass out?
Wish I knew why.

## But why take the chance, when there must be other doctors?
We have no choice. Duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and he's right here, at hand.

## His technician okay? In addition to the Looks Department?
No question of her loyalty.

## I don't mean to be inquisitive. But this ?
.

## Say that again?
General, I've heard some wild ones. But this takes it.

## You mean  going along?
As part of the Crew.

## Attack? Who -- or should I say what from?
Just one, General...

## Where can I get a cab back to town?
Oh yes, great. The only problem is, he can't remember what he came to tell us.

## Can't remember?... What do you mean?
He's blanked out on that one particular point.

## And no matter what happens, you're to take orders  from Dr. Michaels, understand?
Listen...the Heart.

## But we just can't leave him in there! What'll happen to him?
We'll know -- in the next breath...

## Wouldn't it be quicker if we all helped?
Yes, there's no time to spare. And those fibers can be quite tenacious.

## What is it? Anything wrong?
I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.

## Cora, is something wrong with the laser?
I don't know yet, Doctor. And I won't know until I test it.

## Bet you're pretty handy around the house... Can you cook?
We're pushing oxygen today.

## Doctor -- is it possible? That we're seeing it happen before our eyes?
I have no idea.

## A great deal more than that, I believe...
Shouldn't you answer that?

## Such as?
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...

## What gives you that idea?
That's why you're really here. I knew it from the start.

## As obvious as that? Our Security people will jump for joy. I suppose Duval's onto me, too?
You're not the first, but he's much too innocent, much too involved with his work, to realize what's going on around him.

## What do you mean?
Nothing -- against all that force.

## Better Judgment?! To wait until the actual operation -- when it may be too late?
I've done all I could with the laser.

## What's that?
The Breath of God...

## You mean Inner Space is endless?
Everything can be divided in half, no matter how minute.

## Mind letting me in on what's going on out there?
Don't tell me they're refueling...

## Isn't there another surgical procedure you can try?
No, there's no other way.

## Isn't there another route? So we can by-pass all this?
Yes... We can transfer over to the Inner Ear, and go by way of the Endolymphatic Duct.

## How does it look, Doctor?
If I can relieve the pressure on a few key vessels...

## The ship's good as finished. We'll have to get out on our own! Is there a quick way out?
We could follow the Optic Nerve to the corner of the Eye.

## At an operation?
Surgical assassination?! But that means you suspect --

## How are you, Miss Peterson?
About forty miles an hour.

## A what?
A forced joining of an Artery and Vein. Must've happened when Benes was hurt.

## If we can't go back, is there an alternate route?
Yes... We can go forward on this course, but it means going directly through the Heart.

## Walt for the lull -- between the time he inhales and exhales.
Well, we better get on with it.

## Grant -- wait a minute -- you're not going to dismantle the wireless?
Just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes.

## Well, sir? Which is it? The wireless, or Benes' life?
Send the following message...

## I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
You have no right to blame Duval --

## No, we should reach the base of the Brain shortly. And from there, it's not far to the site of the injury.
Two in a row?

## Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.
How long will it take to get from here to the Removal Point?

## I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?
I can't tell you.

## Where we going?
I can't tell you that either... Excuse me, Mr. Grant, but you've got a smudge on your cheek.

## May I?
Go ahead.

## What'd you do that for?
I'm married.

## Out of your element, aren't you, Captain?
Sort of.

## Atomic fuel?
Nothing you could see with the naked eye. But there's a microscopic radio-active particle inside.

## If it's no military secret, how can a sub run on a microscopic particle?
That's cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit.

## Any reserve air?
Enough to breathe, but that's all.

## What happened?
Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...

## What is it, Skipper?
We're losing pressure in the Flotation Tanks. Check the Manual, right over there.

## Could I run a tube through that Wall, without harming Benes?
I could use a lawnmower...

## Captain, how will you be able to follow my charts -- --from up there?
On the Repeater.

## Was there any damage?
Not to the valve. But we've lost too much air to make it the rest of the way.

## ...What do you mean, you decided not to park here?
Unghh... oh, geez...

## Can I see your license and registration please?
Certainly.

## What's this, sir?
That's my license and registration. I wanna be in compliance.

## Have ya been to the Celebrity Room before? With other, uh, clients?
I don't know. Few munce.

## ...What're you talking about?
Or your fucking wife, you know.

## What?
We stop at Pancakes Hause.

## ...Come on, man. Okay, here's an idea. We'll stop outside of Brainerd. I know a place there we can get laid. Wuddya think?
I'm fuckin' hungry now, you know.

## Yeah, yeah, Jesus - I'm sayin', we'll stop for pancakes, then we'll get laid. Wuddya think?
No.

## ...Would it kill you to say something?
I did.

## Huh?
The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.

## You want your own wife kidnapped?
Personal matters.

## ...Blood has been shed.
...Who's Jean?

## What the heck d'ya mean?
Three people. In Brainerd.

## ...The heck d'ya mean?
End a April.

## Any others?
This'll be our first. We've been waiting a long time.

## You have children?
Both of these.

## Mr. Mohra?
Well, Ecklund & Swedlin's, that's closer ta Moose Lake, so I made that assumption.

## What'd this guy look like anyways?
Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny- lookin'.

## Uh-huh - in what way?
Just a general way.

## No, I gotta - hey, Norm, I thought you were goin' fishin' up at Mile Lacs?
The numbers y'asked for, calls made from the lobby pay phone at the Blue Ox. Two to Minneapolis that night.

## Uh-huh... A what?
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.

## Where you girls from?
Chaska.

## In what way?
I dunno. Just funny-looking.

## Can you be any more specific?
I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.

## Was he funny-looking apart from that?
Yah.

## So you were having sex with the little fella, then?
Uh-huh.

## Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
No. Like I say, he was funny-looking. More'n most people even.

## Oh, yah?
LeSeure. But I went to high school in White Bear Lake.

## Yah?
Yah. Maybe I'm sayin' that cause he smoked Marlboros.

## The financials are pretty thorough, so the only thing we don't know is your fee.
You know what a disparity is?

## ...My fee? Wade, what the heck're you talkin' about?
They're gonna call, give me instructions for a drop. I'm supposed to have the money ready tomorrow.

## Okay. We'll get the money together. Don't worry about it, Jerry. Now, d'you want anyone at home, with you, until they call?
No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.

## Okay. And Scotty, is he gonna be all right?
You bet.

## Dad! What're they doing? Wuddya think they're doin' with Mom?
It's okay, Scotty. They're not gonna want to hurt her any. These men, they just want money, see.

## What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?
No, no, nothin's goin' wrong here. Grandad and I, we're - we're makin' sure this gets handled right.

## What... What is it all about?
Huh? Do you mind if I sit down - I'm carrying quite a load here.

## ...You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?
Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager.

## ...Brainerd?
Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.

## Yah, ya know we've got the big statue there. So you haven't had any vehicles go missing, then?
No. No, ma'am.

## So how do you - have you done any kind of inventory recently?
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.

## ... I'm sorry, sir?
Ma'am, I answered your question. I answered the darn - I'm cooperating here, and I...

## Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?
Yah, real good.

## Yah, real good. How you doin'?
Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.

## All right, Jerry, you got this phone to yourself?
Well... yah.

## Well, yah, I got an idea. How's that Ciera workin' out for ya?
Circumstances have changed, Jerry.

## Well, what do ya mean?
Things have changed. Circumstances, Jerry. Beyond the, uh... acts of God, force majeure..

## ...Yah.
What the - how's Jean?

## ...Dad?
It's okay, Scotty.

## Shep said you'd be here at 7,30. What gives, man?
Shep said 8,30.

## Ya got the car?
Yah, you bet. It's in the lot there. Brand-new burnt umber Ciera.

## Sure, Jerry, we're all set. Why wouldn't we be?
Yah, no, I'm sure you are. Shep vouched for you and all. I got every confidence in you fellas.

## ...Dad?
Yah.

## ...Is everything okay?
Yah.

## Are you calling Stan?
Well... I'm goin' ta bed now.

## Whatcha watchin' there?
Norstars.

## ...Who they playin'?
OOOoooh! His reaction synchronizes with a reaction from the crowd.

## Wade, have ya had a chance to think about, uh, that deal I was talkin' about, those forty acres there on Wayzata?
You told me about it.

## Oh, nothing, Wade. How ya doin' there?
Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet.

## No kiddin'?
Stan and I're okay.

## It's my money, I'll deliver it - what do they care?
All the more reason! I don't want you - with all due respect, Jerry - I don't want you mucking this up.

## The heck d'ya mean?
They want my money, they can deal with me. Otherwise I'm goin' to a professional. He points at a briefcase.

## Say, Shep, how ya doin' there?
Mm.

## Say, ya know those two fellas ya put me in touch with, up there in Fargo?
Never heard of him. Don't vouch for him.

## Yah, thanks a bunch. So what's the deal, now? Gary says triple homicide?
Yah, looks pretty bad. Two of'm're over here.

## Where is everybody?
Well - it's cold, Margie.

## Ya see something down there, Chief?
Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf.

## Geez, you okay, Margie?
I'm fine - it's just morning sickness.

## Yah?
Yah. Now I'm hungry again.

## You had breakfast yet, Margie?
Oh, yah. Norm made some eggs.

## Yah? Well, what now, d'ya think?
Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy.

## How's it look, Marge?
Well, he's got his gun on his hip there, and he looks like a nice enough guy. It's a real shame.

## You haven't monkeyed with his car there, have ya?
No way.

## No, no, I just wanna get Norm some night crawlers.
Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?

## You look in his citation book?
Yah...

## Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates. DLR?
Oh...

## Yah. Say, Lou, ya hear the one about the guy who couldn't afford personalized plates, so he went and changed his name to J2L 4685?
Yah, that's a good one.

## Geez, that's a good lead. The Blue Ox, that's that trucker's joint out there on I-35?
Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company.

## Oh, yah?
...You can sleep, hon. It's early yet.

## Gotta go?
Yah.

## Yah, yah, course I remember. How are ya? What time is it?
Oh, geez. It's quarter to eleven. I hope I dint wake you.

## Well, how the heck are ya?
Okay, ya know. Okay.

## Yah - how are you doon?
Just a Diet Coke.

## Oh, yah, a long time ago.
You're livin' in Edina, then?

## Yah, sorry, so I was married to Linda Cooksey - ya remember Linda? She was a year behind us.
Great. What brings ya down - are ya down here on that homicide - if you're allowed, ya know, to discuss that?

## I think I remember Linda, yah. She was - yah. So things didn't work out, huh?
And then I, and then I been workin' for Honeywell for a few years now.

## It's okay, Mike - Should we get together another time, ya think?
No - I'm sorry! It's just - I been so lonely - then I saw you, and...

## Well, you do reside their at 1425 Fremont Terrace?
Yep.

## Anyone else residing there?
Uh-huh.

## Norm?
Linda.

## Linda Cooksey?
No. No. No. They weren't - he, uh, he was bothering Linda for about, oh, for a good year. Really pestering her, wouldn't leave her alone.

## Yah. Where are ya, Margie?
Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving around Moose Lake.

## Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
Yah, Menominie only has Chief Perpich and he takes February off to go to Boundary Waters.

## Yah?
Prowler needs a jump.

## You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?
Uh-huh.

## ...How's the paintin' goin'?
Pretty good. Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year.

## Yeah, couple a muskies. No pike yet. How d'you feel?
Oh, fine.

## Not on your feet too much?
No, no.

## You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too. How's the food down there?
Had dinner at a place called the King's Table. Buffet style. It was pretty darn good.

## Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there?
Yah, it's good. No pike yet, but it's good.

## They announced it?
Yah.

## ...So?
Three-cent stamp.

## Your mallard?
Yah.

## And his wife?
She's visiting relatives in Florida. Now his boss, this guy Gustafson, he's also disappeared. Nobody at his office knows where he is.

## Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?
His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months. The big C.

## Right, right.
Where's Tyler?

## He was killed serving Project Mayhem.
What... ?

## I need to know where Tyler is. Can't you help me?
Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.

## Bob. I'm okay. How are you?
Better than I've ever been in my life.

## Really, what's that?
The first rule is... you aren't supposed to talk about it...

## After fight club, everything else in your life gets the volume turned down. You can deal with anything.
You want me to de-prioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade?

## Have you finished those reports?
Yes.

## Is that your blood?
Some of it, yes.

## Hmm?
You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.

## Pretend you're me. You find this. What would you do?
We need to talk.

## Yes?
No, I wasn't aware...

## Does this sound strange to you?
Yes, sire, strange. Very strange.

## What does that mean?
It means it was homemade.

## Who do you think could've done this?
I'll ask the questions, son.

## Can't you give me something?
Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals.

## What?
Okay, in the Sylvia Plath philosophy way, we're all dying. But you're not dying the way Chloe is dying.

## Go ahead. I'll expose you.
Practicing what?

## Why are you doing this?
It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.

## A year? How'd you manage that?
Anyone who might've noticed either died or recovered and never came back.

## Really?
Look, I can't cry with a faker present.

## You're kidding.
Please. Can't we do something... ?

## I don't know -- am I?
I'll take the parasites.

## That's your favorite, too? Tried to slip it by me, eh?
We'll split it. You get it the first and third Sunday of the month.

## Should we?
In case we want to switch nights.

## How did you find me?
The forwarding number. I haven't seen you at any support groups.

## Really?
It's for men.

## Like testicular cancer?
Look, this is a bad time...

## I've been going to debtor's anonymous. You want to see some truly fucked up people?
I'm just on my way out...

## What the hell are you doing here?
Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.

## What are you talking about?
Would you do something for me? I need you to check and see if there's a lump in my breast. I can't afford to throw money away on a doctor.

## Tragically, they're dead. I'm alive and I'm in poverty. You want any?
No, thanks.

## Where? Here?
Here.

## There?
Here.

## Feel anything?
No.

## You feel nothing?
Nothing.

## Really... I mean it. Have you been going to your groups?
Chloe's dead.

## Do you care?
I don't know.

## Hear what?
That... sawing and hammering.

## Have we been talking too long? Must we change the subject?
No.

## What is this? Who did this?
... A person.

## Why would you get bent if I asked?
Let go of me... Leave me alone.

## Can I come in?
He's not here.

## Answer the question!
We've just lost cabin pressure.

## What is wrong with you?
Say my name.

## Say my name! What's my name!?
Whatever. I'll take my food to go...

## What?
You have to get out of here. Leave as soon as possible. Go to any rural town, away from any major city...

## Why are you doing this?
I can't let myself see where you're going. Go wherever it takes you, remember... keep away from major cities...

## What happened... ?
Don't ask.

## Who did this to you?
I did, I think. But, I'm okay... I'm fine...

## Who's this?
Uh... I'm sorry. We met on the plane. We had the same briefcase. I'm... you know, the clever guy.

## I star-sixty-nined you. I never pick up my phone. What's up?
Yes... it's a test.

## What?
You were standing right where you are now, asking how good our security is. It's tight as a drum.

## Is this part of the test?
You're the one who did this to me. You're Mr. Durden, sir. Tyler Durden.

## Two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola. Three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick.
My suitcase was vibrating?

## Tyler Durden.
Pardon me?

## No, supply oxygen?
Oxygen gets you high. In a catastrophic emergency, we're taking giant, panicked breaths...

## What do you want me to do?
I mean -- for a living.

## Thank you.
Why? So you can say, \"Oh, that's what you do.\" -- And be a smug little shit about it?

## What?
Being clever.

## I mean, you did lose a lot of nice, neat little shit. The trendy paper lamps, the Euro-trash shelving unit, am I right?
But maybe, just maybe, you've been delivered.

## What list?
The \"now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again\" list. That list.

## Don't I?
Do what you like.

## A hotel?
Yeah.

## So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel?
I don't follow...

## Huh?
You called me so you could have a place to stay.

## Can I stay at your place?
Yes, you can.

## What's that?
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

## What?
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

## Why would anyone want this shitty job?
It affords him other interesting opportunities.

## Me?
Why not you? I'm letting you go first. Do it.

## Where do you want it? In the face?
Surprise me.

## How do you feel?
Strange.

## Call what off?
The fight.

## What fight?
This fight, pussy.

## Anyone?
Anyone.

## My boss, probably. Who would you fight?
My dad. No question.

## What car?
I don't know how Tyler found the house, but he'd been there for half a year.

## What are you reading?
Soldier of Fortune. Business Week. New Republic.

## Alive or dead?
Doesn't matter.

## Hemingway. You?
Shatner. William Shatner.

## You?
Abe Lincoln. Big reach. Skinny guys fight till they're burger.

## Unbelievable, huh?
He was obviously able to handle it.

## I mean, this girl... uh, you're not into her or anything... ?
No. Not at all.

## You're sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.

## You're okay with this?
I'm fine.

## What?
Okay.

## That was three times you promised.
Promise?

## You want to finish her off?
Uh... nah...

## Don't mention me.
Huh?

## What is this place?
A liposuction clinic.

## Shut up. Our fathers were our models for God. And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
I don't know...

## It isn't... ?
We don't need him...

## ... Marla ... ?
Fuck damnation. Fuck redemption. We are God's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it.

## Yeah. Where you headed?
Work. Going to work.

## What... ?
Nothing. Do what you like.

## Newcastle? Did you start that one?
I thought you did.

## What are we doing?
Homework assignment.

## What is it?
Tyler...

## An expired community college student ID card. What did you used to study, Raymond K. Hessel?
I asked you what you studied.

## Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?
I felt like destroying something beautiful.

## Something on your mind?
Why wasn't I involved from the beginning? You and I started fight club together.

## Is this a needlepoint club? Is it about you and me?
You know what I mean.

## What do you want? A statement of purpose... ?
This does not belong to us. We are not the leaders. We are not special.

## What are you talking about?
Nothing.

## What's this all about, Tyler?
And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South.

## Why do people think I'm you?
You broke your promise. You talked to her about me.

## Why did you do that?
Answer me, Tyler.

## People think that you're me, because you and I happen to share the same body.
Why do people think anything?

## What are you talking about... ?
Sometimes I control it, and you imagine yourself watching me...

## What... what are you saying?
It's okay. We okay... a little codependent, sure, but...

## Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat?
What about them? They're lunatics.

## What about Marla?
She's... you... you're fucking her.

## ...go through with this? What are you going to do?
I'm going to...

## ...stop me?
I'm not going...

## Since when is Project Mayhem about murder?
The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago. Everything's proceeding exactly as planned.

## Green? Did you say green?
Yes...

## Fuck your struggle. I want out.
Bob is dead, Tyler. The police blew a hole in his head. Was that part of your plan?

## You want out?
I quit.

## What?
Defuse the bomb.

## Defuse the bomb?
Yes.

## Can't you call it off... ?
It's out of our hands. This is it.

## What the fuck -- ?
Paraffin.

## What?
Paraffin. Your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin. I saw it floating in the bomb.

## Why can't I get rid of you? Why can't I just wish you away?
You need me.

## Why do you want to do that? Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?
Not my mouth. Our mouth.

## Why are you going with this, Ikea- boy?
It's the only way to get rid of you...

## What?
Appreciate something.

## What?
Look at me...

## What?
My eyes are open.

## Who is this?
Maintenance.

## Excuse me?
Don't worry about us, sir. We're solid.

## Robert Paulson?
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.

## He don't own this place, I do. How much money's he getting for this?
There is no money.

## Really?
It's free to all.

## Ain't that something?
Yes, it is.

## How'd you know?
They give basement apartments letters instead of numbers. Raymond, you're going to die.

## Is this a picture of Mom and Dad?
Yesssss...

## \"Stuff.\" Were the mid-terms hard?
Biology, mostly.

## Why?
I... I don't know...

## What did you want to be, Raymond K. Hessel?
Animals.

## Kimberly Burroughs, eh? What do you want?
I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.

## Yeah, how?
I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.

## It's not just about me. Someone I saved died last night in a freak accident. What if the others are in danger, too?
Well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up.

## What list?
Death's list. The precise order you're going to die in.

## The songs on the radio. But wait. I don't understand. Why is this even happening to me?
That's what Alex used to ask himself right up until...

## How can you say that? What kind of monster are you?
The second one just dies. A 16 year old kid.

## You were there?
I can practically taste the water in my throat. And something else. The smell of flowers...

## Please, what else could it mean?
So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.

## No. If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me. But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive. I'm last on Death's list.
What about that?

## What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
Six duds in a row.

## This makes no sense. Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake. Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested?
I don't think so. Alex's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it.

## What did you see? What am I looking for?
No, it's not here. This one was different. More like the pile up and the van going into the lake.

## What do you want me to do?
Speed up.

## I was dead. And came back to life. An EEG machine. Where's Eugene?
No! It can't be.

## Should we knock?
He probably already knows we're coming.

## She had the baby?
Jury duty? That's randomly selected by social security numbers.

## What about the rest of you? Kimberly, you were driving to Daytona. Was Route 18 your first choice?
I had tickets to go, but one day I'm in Paris, trippin' on acid, sippin' lattes an' such, and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign.

## Dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?
Blow me.

## Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
Blow me. Yellow means go, Kimberly.

## Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
Blow me. Yellow means go, Kimmy.

## Tell me you didn't start up on that Flight 180 shit again. Did you?
Of course not. That would be irresponsible and unprofessional.

## What?
Evan Shaeffer's dead. Guess he wasn't as lucky as we thought.

## What?
I'm Officer Burke. I'm looking for an Isabella Cruz.

## No. What's this about?
We had a fight. Some things got broken, the dog went crazy, she left me. Wouldn't say where she was going.

## What was the fight about?
Take a guess.

## Does she have a cell phone? A way we can contact her?
She did.

## Yeah?
But why single me out? What am I in the great scheme of things? You'd think I stepped off Flight 180 or something... Fucking weird, man.

## Yeah, so what happened?
I never mad it. The Greyhound bus I was on splattered some chick all over the road and we had to stop.

## What's going on here?
There's going to be a pile up. Logs. Bodies everywhere. I saw it happen. It happened.

## Do you remember what triggered it all?
Billboards about accidents. Kids yelling \"pile up\" for no reason. It all felt...just wrong. Just like...

## Like what?
You mean Alex Browning.

## Then you believe all this? That Death is working off a list?
I didn't. Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors.

## New life defeats death? Follow the signs? Where the hell did you find that guy?
Yeah, I thought he was supposed to be helpful.

## It sounds all well and good, but what if we're wrong?
Shit, I don't have her number. She was never interviewed. She took off right after the accident.

## Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Guys, let's not panic. Isabella's safe.

## I wasn't worried about us.
How do you know?

## Shouldn't we pull over?
No time. Keep going. I wouldn't know how to explain any of this anyway.

## I don't...what if I made a mistake?
Impossible. She was on the onramp.

## Then what's the premonition of the lake supposed to mean?
You can't cheat destiny. I know what I have to do to save us. I have to die.

## Want me to drive?
No, I'm good.

## This trip better be worth it. What's the guy-girl ratio again?
Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.

## Can I ask you a question?
Sure.

## When I die. Is it gonna hurt?
I...I don't know.

## And you're gonna die after me, right?
I guess so.

## You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
Relax, Dad. It's Daytona, not Mongolia.

## Fix-A-flat? Road flares? Sunblock? Mace?
I know this is the first time we've been apart since. But everything's gonna be okay.

## Hey, Dad. What's up?
Your car's leaking either transmission or brake fluid. I want you to have it checked ASAP at a gas station.

## What feeling?
That it's not over yet.

## Who am I, David Blane?
You're all certifiable, you know that? I can't believe I've been listening to this crap. Come on, Tim, let's go outside.

## You think... You think those guys were b.s.-ing us today or what?
You think the tooth fairy's gonna come tonight? I'm thinkin' like fifteen bucks.

## I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
He said Death has a design. Even before he said that I had been seeing patterns.

## How many died on Flight 180? From our group?
Thirty-nine.

## Remember the gate number?
No.

## Remember the departure time?
Like... 4,25.

## I don't understand... did you see Tod die? Did it happen again, like on the plane?
No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.

## Why do you think I was hiding?
Is knowing going to make it easier? It makes it harder.

## Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay.
No!

## And then the cabin banged and the left side exploded. The the whole plane... blew up. It was so real. Exactly how everything goes.
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?

## Been on many planes that blew up, have you?
Me, too. But my dad doesn't understand. When he's better; you and me, road trip to the City. Catch the Yanks.

## Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
Did you take any sedatives before boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping pills?

## Alex... can you promise me that no one else will die?
No... I can't. As long as I'm in here, it's outta my control.

## Why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide?
His father's pretty fucked up with denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son.

## Design?
I'm sorry we broke in.

## What are you doing?
Terry's name should be on this wall.

## So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?
That's right, buddy.

## I gotta tell you, it's just luck you guys came when you did. They move us around a lot... We only been at that camp a week. Got a smoke?
No.

## You mean the snake?
Yeah. It's not hard once you get the hang of it. In the wrist. Anyway, I did what I always do when I get one...

## What's that?
Your buddy made it out last night. The place went apeshit.

## Really? How come he didn't take me?
Maybe because you're shot in the leg.

## Star Wars?
... and there's this guy with a black helmet and cape, right, and he's got this sword... except it's not a sword, it's light...

## Ever do this from a jet?
No.

## Gettin' old, huh?
Yeah. Second set. Let's go.

## Yeah. Why not?
You break your leg, I'll have to shoot you.

## You read me, Brewer?
Read you.

## You okay?
Keep it down, man. I got problems.

## What do you call that?
Batteries not included.

## What's this?
AC-System 'Big-Ear' telescopic mike with built-in audio processor. Can pull a whisper out of a loud cocktail party at 50 meters.

## That's it? Some C-4, a map and a knife?
There's a compass in the handle.

## You wanna know why I stood up for this show?
No.

## What's this stuff on the rice?
Fermented fish sauce.

## Who cares? Let's just do it and get out. Go have a Jacuzzi and get laid in Bangkok. Know what I mean?
We'll check it out.

## Brewer. Does a jet make noise?
Yeah...

## What's she saying?
She likes you. Says you're dinky- dau.

## What's that?
Powerful warrior.

## Yeah. Dinky-dau, that's me. Hey, Co. You wanna meet Jake the one- eyed snake?
These guys look like they'd sell their mothers.

## How you doing, Brewer?
I need a vacation.

## American?
Can't tell. Pretty tall. He's real scrunched up in that thing.

## Are they going to torture us?
Yes.

## What... whattaya do?
Gawd, you look awful.

## You comin'?
Hold your pantyhose. Here, gimme a hand.

## Can you handle the door gun?
Duck soup.

## Brewer! You know what that thing's packing?
It's a Soviet MIL MI-24. Probably has 12.7mm nose cannon, heat-seeking rockets and wire guided missiles, plus...

## How much we got left in that minigun?
I'm Rambo. This is Brewer. Her name is Co.

## You really got a Masters Degree?
Sure. I only sound like forty-year- old in your language.

## How do we get upriver?
I have arranged transportation. We meet soon. But I think you to be disappointed.

## Why's that?
I go up to this camp two months ago. Nobody there. Empty for years.

## Where did you find this clown?
I thought he was with you.

## Spooks?
Intelligence work.

## Where's Nguyen now? What city?
Huntington Beach, California.

## Are you okay?
Yes. But I lose many merits in next life. Very bad.

## Why'd they want us?
They heard about escaped prisoner on radio. Make deal. More than we pay.

## Christ. How'd you get here?
Took bus, most of way. I knew you would come here.

## And how'd you sneak up like that?
Carefully. Don't want to get shot by you. Bad karma. Anyway, you need me.

## I do?
You think you are... .

## Yes you can.
You try get across Laos? Get to Thailand?

## How?
Minigun. Come on. Let's move. He's coming in on our open side.

## I'm authorized to get you out of here. I thought that's what you wanted.
It doesn't hurt. Why doesn't it hurt?

## What's the job?
Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out. Two men. Two days.

## Why me?
We like you. At least the computer at Langley likes you. Pulled your file because of various factors. Service record. Area familiarity.

## Where?
Not yet.

## We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
Negative. Absolutely not. The phase two assault team will get them out.

## We just take pictures?
Don't look so disappointed. It should be hairy enough... even for you.

## All this is for us?
That's right.

## What?
Um... actually, no. It looks like he shot down one of their gunships...

## What?
He... took it.

## How long have you been setting up?
About 22 hours on site.

## How long before you're fully on line?
Couple hours. Let me buy you a coffee.

## POWs? I don't know. But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks. Cream?
It's not necessary.

## This mission was a scam from the word go?
Rambo and Brewer were selected as write-offs.

## So there never was a Phase Two rescue team?
Of course not. You can't get approval to rescue a kitten from a tree after Tehran.

## Who're you?
I could a couple of days ago. Gonna be... stiff.

## What's your name?
De Fravio. Dave De Fravio. Lieutenant... Air Force.

## Mind if I sit down?
I hear you're not enjoying it here.

## Am I out of here?
There were treating me like a headcase.

## This your stuff?
That's it. My life.

## What did you want?
You just picked that wrong war to be a hero in.

## This just occurred to somebody, now?
Listen up. You two are married as of now. Get used to it.

## But now it's free, right?
Yeah.

## Well did you or didn't you?
Yes! They'll be in soon.

## I like your nails. Where did you get them done?
Ah... I do them myself. I used to work in a beauty parlor.

## Can I get you anything...coffee... tea...a little tequilla?
No, thank you.

## You threw him out?
My parents were divorced.

## Do I look like I have someone special?
Well, there's nobody special!

## What?
Meeting ... people.

## I don't understand you. What is the problem?
I'm paying you.

## Getting your nails done is one thing but going to dinner with a bunch of strangers and him... She didn't even look at him.
Really?

## Got any more bread crust?
I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous. It's the only reason to go out with a bum.

## Why don't you go upstairs... take the day off. All right?...I'll cook tonight.
You're surprised!... But I guess I just never met the right guy. Whatta gonna do?

## Well, it's funny! Whatta want from me?
It's not funny. It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.

## Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
Yeah, well... suicidal paranoiacs say funny things sometimes.

## I can't tell you how distraught I was. All night long. What the hell happened?
I was attacked.

## Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.
... So... where did you sleep last night?

## You still believe in God?
... You have a little... uh... something on your face...

## I get this feeling like I'm... a magnet but I attract shit. Out of all the people in this city, why did I meet a man who's wife I killed?
You didn't kill anybody. Stop.

## Lydia?! Lydia who!?
I don't know her last name... I'll be off in a second.

## The moron?
He's not a moron.

## And who's Lydia?
Lydia is the girl Parry likes... And I thought, if I could get them together I...

## Well, what the hell does that mean?
Hello....congratulations.

## He just needs some clothes?
Well talk back. He won't bite you.

## What do you think?
I think they're made for each other. And it scares me.

## You know, I can't believe I did it. You think it'll work out?
Who's knows. My Aunt Marge used to say, \"some matches are made in heaven, some are made in hell and some are made in hardware stores\".

## So what's going on? Who's Lou again?
My agent. I called my agent.

## Ugh, these tapes are a mess. I don't know where to begin...
You're kidding! What did he say?

## ... What?... You don't want to commute?
No, it's not... Come here...

## \"I'm an incredible woman?\" What is this, a death sentence?
No, I... I think we should talk about this.

## You want to talk? Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
No... it's just...

## Slowed things down? Where have I been? Have we been going fast!?
Right now, I'm just not sure about... making such definite plans.

## So, Edwin, baby, this is Sunrise Confession time... what have you got for us?
I... I... went to this bar... this very, ya know -- hard-to-get-in place... called Babbitt's...

## Can I help you?
I'm... just looking for Parry...

## Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.

## Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
Venice...Like Katherine Hepburn in SUMMERTIME......Why can't I be Katherine Hepburn...

## Um...I've got to run. I've bee doing this all day. Are you going to be all right?
Oh please!...I was born a Catholic in Brooklyn... I've been to hell and back.... I'll be fine... ....Thanks...You're a gem.

## Good. You believe this drunk?
.....Me neither.

## About dinner as a concept or about dinner with... Raoul?
You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood.

## ... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body. Do you know what that means? What this could lead to?
Jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining Pi.

## I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran. Want some?
No, I have to work.

## Yeah? Who is this?
Yes.

## Yes well... You are a credit card holder, are you not?
Huh-huh.

## Which ones?
All of them... Which means you have just won a free membership at our store on Second Avenue.

## Well, I don't understand. What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
A list.

## Well there.... What's the difference?
Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.

## Yes. Hi..Congratulations. Jack Lucas. Nice to meet you finally. This is Anne Napolitano, the owner of Video Spot.
Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?

## Now what?
Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...

## Free?
Yes. They're free.

## How much?
Well, since you're a member, we could...

## Tonight! How's tonight?
God, I have no idea. She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea. I'll call her.

## This is it. I'm in hell. Damned to an eternity of idiotic conversation.
Please don't hurt me?

## Have I died?
Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...

## My name is Parry.
Where am I?

## The Little People?
They said you're The One.

## I'm not... Now, where are those shoes...
I'm the one what?

## ... Do you know who I am?
Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.

## A quest?
But I need help and they sent you.

## Him...?
God... I'm the janitor of God.

## The Holy Grail? Some billionaire has the Holy Grail sitting in a commode on Madison Avenue?
Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.

## What's her name?
I don't know.

## Why did you do that?
Here...I just would like to help you. I thought...maybe...you could use some money.

## That's O.K.
Fifty dollars?

## Can I take you to lunch?
I don't know. But I gave it to you...to help YOU...not him.

## You really want to help me?
Pretty impressive huh?...Don't let it scare you. I'll admit it's formidable but everything has it's weakness.

## So what? You going to help me?
Parry...

## Well, maybe he wants to stay here. Do...do you want to stay here?
It's such a great song.

## .....What are you doing?
I can't ask for her...I have to earn her.

## Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
In a bar called Hellfire.

## What are the other reasons?
...I feel so much for her...I feel like something awful is going to happen.

## Are you all right?
OWW...MAN...

## Parry Parry?
No just Parry.

## Well, we have plenty of those. Right over here. We got the MGM series, Astaire and Rogers, the Judy Garlands...
How about the \"Hell Merchants\"?

## Got any Ethel Merman?
... Uh... we seem to be all out of Ethel Merman.

## How do you know him?
We were neighbors for a couple for weeks on Sutton Place.

## What do you do - for a living I mean?
Well, I'm in search of the Holy Grail.

## What are we about to do?
Well... you're walking me home. I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...

## Oh no, I want to. I've got a hard-on for you the size of Canada... but I don't... want just one night. I have a confession to make?
You're married.

## See, I told you it was him... Your name's Donnie something, right?
I leave it to you.

## Twinky?
Yeah, 'cause she's so \"twinky\"...

## A wig?
Yeah, I told her it was you, but that you're wearing a wig, 'cause on TV you're mostly bald in the front.

## Out where?
You can sing the song.

## Is it my turn again?
Right. Now show me a little somethin' this time, okay? Give me some form...

## I did, didn' I, El?
You got another ball comin'.

## You just going to sit there?
Yes.

## Do you love me, Bobby?
I'll be gone two or three weeks.

## You like it?
No.

## Is what you?
You're depressed that I come along.

## Well, is that a happy face I see?
Cause if it was me, I could just catch a Greyhound back.

## So how long am I supposed to sit an' twiddle my thumbs in this place?
If you can't do what I ask, Ray, use that money to go back home, then.

## Or maybe sit out by the pool an' get myself nice an' tan for you. Would you like that?
Sure...

## This certainly is an improvement on the motel an' the coffee shop. How could you have left such a beautiful place, Bobby?
I don't know.

## What?
Just finish eating.

## Oh, am I holdin' up dessert?
It's all right. He don't mean anything by that.

## I don't, huh?
Bobby...

## I'm gonna go in that cafe an' get some coffee. You want anything?
No.

## Sure you don't want anything?
Fill it up.

## What's your name?
Palm Apodaca.

## How far are you going to?
Washington.

## Where are you going?
Alaska.

## Alaska? Are you on vacation?
You don't have to tell everybody about it. Pretty soon they'll all go there and it won't be so clean.

## I saw a picture of it. Alaska is very clean. It appeared to look very white to me... Don't you think?
Fantastic! That you could figure all that out, and lay that down on her, to come up with a way you could get your toast.

## I didn't get it, did I?
No, but it was very clever... I would of just punched her out.

## No. How much do I owe you?
Five'll do it.

## What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?
No. We have tomatoes.

## But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?
Only what's on the menu... A Number Two, Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.

## Would you like to talk to the manager?
I don't make the rules.

## One Number Two, and a chicken sal san -- hold the butter, the mayo, the lettuce -- and a cup of coffee... Anything else?
Now all you have to do is hold the chicken, bring me the toast, charge me for the sandwich, and you haven't broken any rules.

## Am I on TV?
She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.

## Would you tell her Bobby's here?
Oh my goodness... Bobby...

## You know who it once belonged to?
No.

## Everybody still up on the Island?
Well, Herbert's mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra, so at the moment, there's just Daddy, Carl and myself... and Van Oost.

## Who's Van Oost?
Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.

## Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?
Well, 11 months ago he was on his bicycle, on his way to the post office in La Roche... and he ran into a Jeep and sprained his neck...

## What?
Daddy's very ill.

## I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
No...

## Well, I'll be seeing you in a couple of days, won't I?
Oh God, I'm so glad, Robert, that you're coming...

## How long have you been staying here?
A couple of months.

## I mean, you think I'm that happy?
No, I don't. You should've left a long time ago.

## Well, do you -- I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?
Sometimes.

## No, no, I don't think that, I'm just curious about it... Do you think I'm a freak?
Sort of.

## Oh no... Why? What is it? The way I look?
No, I don't really think you're a freak.

## What about Carl and Catherine? Is he just coaching her, or what?
Constantly. Night and day. And unless I get up before the birds, I can't get in any practice time for myself...

## Like what?
Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...

## Well, you're not going to run out on me right away, are you?
I don't know.

## With applesauce?
No, thanks...

## I'm not. He does walk funny. Don't you see that?
I don't think I'd notice. I'm so used to Carl.

## Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?
Sailors are sadistic, I feel.

## Where is she, anyway?
Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...

## You were going without saying goodbye?
I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.

## But what about me?
I'll say goodbye to you, Tita.

## What have you been doing since then?
What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.

## And you no longer play at all?
Hello...

## Swimming?
Playing piano all day and then jumping into cold water. You could get a cramp.

## Besides piano and swimming, what else do you do?
Nothing.

## That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
I don't know. Let me give it some thought.

## Then after that?
After that, I plan to read some music and rest for awhile.

## Is that funny?
It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way.

## Why?
It doesn't matter. It was the feeling I was affected by.

## You had no inner feeling?
None.

## What?
At being a fake.

## It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?
I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...

## Some bath oil?
I don't find your language that charming.

## Serious, that's what's important to you?
Yes, that's what's important to me...

## That's what you said?
Something witty and devastating like that.

## As a matter of fact, he's the one who introduced me to Carl... How are you?
I'm fine.

## Is he?
Yes.

## Do you think you could discreetly move across the hall now?
Yeah, I think I could.

## What?
I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you'd like to.

## I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?
I have to talk to you.

## Will you let me talk to you, please?
I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.

## And living out here, in this rest home asylum, that's what you want?
Yes.

## What?
She's tremendously gifted, this girl.

## Is she?
I hope you feel at home, Robert. I'm really glad you're here.

## You sure you should be playing, Carl?
What do you mean? Aside from my neck, I'm in superb shape.

## I'm not aware of it. Like what?
Your serve. Two -- Eighteen.

## See? There's nothing wrong with the way I walk. Now where are we?
At game, Carl.

## I thought you had to go to the mainland today. Aren't you going to miss the ferry?
Oh, for chrissakes...

## Robert, let's not be rude, okay?
Robert, I think you better just...

## Haven't you got a jacket or anything with you?
No, I don't, I uh... it got burned up. Everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. All I got left is what I have on...

## You've been staying in a motel all this time?
I don't understand why you had to stay in a motel. There's more than enough room here.

## What kind of doggy is that?
It's a Borzoi.

## What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?
No, I wouldn't.

## Pardon me?
The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.

## Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
If you want to call it that.

## Aaron, how you doin'?
Fine.

## Just get the fuck outta here.
What?

## Alright, tell me, what'd you hear?
There's a rumor that you were tryin' to get somebody to beat me up.

## Is it true?
I told you, no. I'm not that type.

## Who are you?
I'm wit' Carlos.

## Do you have a name?
Victor.

## What?
Victor.

## Wussup?
Wussup.

## So watcha doin'?
Nothin'.

## What are you doin' here?
I, umm, came to see you.

## Oh you know, cleaned the house, cooked. Took care of my little sisters. Sit down. So where's Carlos?
I guess he's outside someplace I don't like takin' him down to certain places.

## Whadja wanna see me about?
I just wanted to see you.

## So you got a girl?
Of course.

## So what's her name?
You know. I got a lot, more than one.

## You got a boyfriend?
Me? No. Don't want none either. Such bastards, man.

## So wadda you do with your girls?
Just chill.

## That's it?
Nah, we make out and stuff.

## So what you think of me?
You look good.

## I look good, that's it. So what else do you do for these girls?
I buy them flowers.

## How you treat them?
Good. I'm faithful to them.

## Well, you know I'm standin' here and you say I look good?
I kissed those girls.

## Wussup?
Wussup, Victor.

## Why don't you ask Eddie?
Yo, Carlos-I'm gonna punch you.

## Why?
I got punished, man.

## Fa what?
I won't let my motha cut my hair.

## I'll be right down.
Wha'?

## Where you goin'?
Pitt.

## Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?
C'mon.

## Eddie from Compost?
No, Baruch.

## Which one?
You know, Eddie's cousin.

## She lives near Eddie?
I think she lives down by Pitt.

## Near Natasha's? Or over by Boy's Club?
I think by Twenty-two.

## Yeah, he got a bad attitude.
For real?

## You said before, that he got boxes?
Yeah, he got boxes in his stomach. He's taller than me.

## How old is he?
I think he's 18 or 17.

## You gonna talk to him?
Um, yeah I think so.

## Like this?
Yeah, that's right, you got it girl.

## Now salsa, you know how to dance salsa?
Yeah.

## You here to see somebody?
Yeah.

## Who?
A girl named Amanda.

## Positive.
What she look like?

## You sure?
Positive.

## So what do you want with her anyway?
I'm a good friend of hers.

## What?
Nothing.

## You wanna do somethin' with me?
Jus' from around the way.

## You live around here?
Yeah.

## You gotta girLfrLend?
I know how ta get him back if you want.

## I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?
God I admire you.

## By the way, what kind of name is Poon?
Comanche Indian.

## So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
We'd have no way of knowing that, sir.

## Hmm. It's just that there are some other people from my office going on this trip and... is there anyone in the seat next to me?
Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.

## What?
Sally Ann Cavanaugh. Oh wait, she couldn't work in your office, she's not from around here.

## Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
That's what he said.

## He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?
I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.

## Creasy, how old are you?
Nineteen.

## Hey, what are you doing?
Hey you're really nuts.

## What? What are you talking about?
I busted their window, they didn't do anything.

## You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve. So what's your name?
I'm President of the International Fletch Corporation.

## Why are you doing this Mr. Fletch?
Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you.

## We're looking at five years, maybe ten. Is that what you want... Jane Doe?
I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men.

## Can I ask anybody now?
Can I call my Mom? I'd like to tell here how much I've always loved her.

## What'll it be Fletch?
Its been very nice meeting you. I enjoy your column.

## Speaking of which, you're not going to print anything before my investigation is through, are you?
Not a prayer.

## Not at all, Chief. But next time... no tongue, okay?
Greetings, everyone.

## What the hell are you doing here?
Put the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them.

## So where do you know Alan from?
We play tennis at the club.

## Really. The California Racquet Club?
Yes.

## Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
That's Babar.

## Two bs?
One. B-a-b-a-r.

## Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?
I don't know. I don't have any.

## No children?
No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.

## Your aunt?
Mrs. Smith.

## Well, which one?
Margaret.

## Did I say 'kidneys'? I meant my ear. Maybe I should see an ear dahhh -- Ever serve time?
Breathe easy...

## Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
Just relax.

## Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?
I can't discuss another patient. You know that. Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.

## I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual, don't you?
Yeah, we check you into Mt. Hebron for a few days, run lots of tests, charge a bundle. You can pull your pants up now.

## I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.

## So what do you figure?
No idea.

## No idea at all?
Okay. Some idea.

## Like when?
Like tonight.

## No, not for sure. When it comes, it comes. You gonna want some shit?
I think Id rather have drugs.

## Sorry. I find a little humor really brightens things up around here, dont you?
Jesus.

## What, the heat here?
Affirmative.

## The two surfer boys?
Affirmative.

## Thought so. What for?
For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy gave me a deposition.

## I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --
You gonna nail the chief?

## You don't have a piece of the action?
Noooo. Free snort. That's it.

## You find the source?
Gum thought Brazil.

## It's me doctor Rosenpenis. I just have to take another peek at Alan Stanwyk's file. What have they done with this place?
Nothing. They're still there.

## Where am I?
You're in the Records Room.

## Can I get you something?
Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.

## Is there anything particular you're looking for?
Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here. Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.

## That's it?
That's it.

## What about breaking and entering? Are you wearing anything under that?
I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.

## Are you serious?
That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars.

## I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket?
Of course.

## Why don't you check it out for yourself, Mr. Nugent?
Because I trust you, Alan. By the way, the name's Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.

## What?
Read this, please.

## And what was that?
How similar in build you and I are. Then I figured it. You bump me off, throw me in the car, and burn me up.

## I was already prepared to commit one murder. What makes you think I won't commit two?
Whoops.

## Harry S. Truman?
My parents were great fans of the former President.

## Dropped two big ones. Real fighter. You're in the insurance line, Harry?
Right.

## California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions?
Come on in.

## Velma. You and Velma are the parents of Alan Stanwyk, Beverly Hills, California, executive vice president of Boyd Aviation?
Check.

## Okay. Now, the last time you saw your son was when?
Oh, about ten days ago.

## Ten days ago?
That's right. Alan comes by every three weeks or so.

## Isn't that nice. Since when?
Since he moved to L.A.

## What the hell does this have to do with insurance?
Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.

## Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?
Then he has.

## Where are you going?
Away. I think it might take you a while to get your life back together. You don't need me around. Don't go back in there.

## I really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I?
You sure did.

## John Ultramalensky, right?
Right.

## What are you doing here?
No problem.

## Hi Gummy. Hows the eye?
Its okay. The cops did it.

## Fletch?
Don't call me Fletch. Don't look at me. Lie back down. We'll talk.

## What?
Cops are here. I can smell them. They're after me. Lie down, Gum.

## Why are they after you?
Because I'm a newspaper reporter and I'm nailing Chief Cummings as the source for drugs on the beach. You're in big trouble, Gummy.

## What's that?
He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he just received the drugs. You did the selling.

## Where does the Chief get the drugs?
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.

## Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
That's Brazil.

## Why not?
Because we can't.

## Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.

## Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?
It is nothing of a sexual nature I assure you. One thousand, just to listen. I don't see how you could turn that down Mr...

## Who?
Hopalong Cassidy. Killed himself here. Bow and arrow. Strange.

## Why don't you try suicide?
My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.

## So why pick me?
You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks.

## Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?
I've got fifty thousand dollars says you will.

## Wouldn't they normally be locked?
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.

## Precisely. Are you a good shot?
What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.

## Do you have a passport?
Sure, all drifters do.

## Take it where?
LAX. Go to the Pan Am desk. There will be a ticket waiting for you.

## Where am I going?
Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.

## They serve dinner on the flight?
It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.

## You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?
I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.

## You sure those doors will be open?
Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else.

## Will you kill me?
Only if you promise not to return me.

## Magic' today, huh?
Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.

## Did you hear something?
Not me.

## You doing a story on this guy?
Maybe.

## Did you say cops?
Yeah.

## I'm sorry?
His bride. Cute as a button.

## Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?
Cute thing.

## Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
Oh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some.

## Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception?
No, thank you.

## How about Marvin's sixty-fifth birthday party?
I haven't seen you since the wedding, Jeez, you look great.

## Oh, mine! Thank God. Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?
John Ultrarelamensky.

## You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan?
What are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him. And he's been so preoccupied.

## Why do you keep doing this?
I love the outfits.

## Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?
Alan's in Utah.

## I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.

## What's he doing in Utah?
None of your business, now go away. You're throwing my game off.

## Who is it?
It's John. John... Znhcneelsky.

## John Ultramalensky?
Hi.

## I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think... What do you want?
I ordered lunch.

## You ordered it here?
Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.

## Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you?
Yes.

## All this goes on Underhill's bill?
I saved his life during the war.

## You were in the war?
No. He was. I got him out.

## Can I ask you a question?
Depends on the question.

## Are you still in love with Alan?
No. I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else.

## Why'd you let me in?
Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.

## Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?
Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.

## What about his parents?
He never sees them and I never met them.

## How come?
Thanks for the great time.

## What is this?
Long story.

## Yeah.
Why did you do it?

## I'll cover it. You have any other surprises?
Yeah. My name's not John Ultramalensky and I wasn't at your wedding.

## So?
So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth.

## What are you talking about?
That's what I want to know.

## How do you know about that?
He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad.

## Here's this dog that tried to eat me. Here's my motel. Here's the car I rented...
What does all this mean?

## Stop it. Are you saying my husband is defrauding me?
I don't know. All I know is that he told me a lot of things and so far not one of them has been true.

## What are you talking about?
I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.

## Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
Act natural.

## What's wrong, Gail?
I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.

## Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist?
Yes, I'm with the Underhills.

## Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?
In her cabana, sir.

## Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six?
Cabana one.

## Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?
I would, actually.

## Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.

## I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
I recommend it.

## You want I set up?
No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.

## What?
The door was unlocked.

## I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.
What?

## Who are you?
Don Corleone. I'm a cousin of Mrs. Cavanaugh's.

## Where is she?
Moved out.

## She moved out?
I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.

## What did you want under the bed?
Mattress police. There are no tags on the mattress. I'm going to have to take you downtown. Please give me your weapon.

## No, I want an answer, Is the story done?
I never read the paper.

## Now, Irwin, try to follow me. You can't run the ad and then not run the story.
What's the spread on the game tonight?

## Why not? Oh shit... really?
Just kidding, Frank. You'll have the story and you'll be damn proud of it.

## You broke it? You know the source?
Practically.

## Who?
Well, there we're in a gray area.

## How gray?
I'd say charcoal.

## I'm going to bite out your eyeballs, you know that?
Frank, you animal, I love it. I'll have the story by Thursday night, I swear to God. I hope.

## Just give me a hint, all right?
All right. Maybe there are some crooked cops involved in all this.

## Utah?
Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.

## What about finding the source?
I have some ideas.

## Who? Donnie and Marie?
Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt.

## How could you call him?
It's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don't know anything about.

## What? Who the hell are they?
This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy.

## You were going to can me, right?
Not really.

## Not really?
I was upset.

## Jim Swarthout?
Yeah.

## And, I'm sorry, who are you again?
Frieda's boss.

## Who's Frieda?
My secretary.

## Yes?
I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.

## I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
Of course.

## Don't say it. Orange juice?
Please.

## Fag? Ass? I'm sorry, is that a joke?
Poor taste. I know. Listen, I respect homosexuals. When I was young, my maid was a homosexual. My maid was a homosexual.

## Excuse me?
Five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree.

## Who?
Nuthin'.

## Did she tell you anything?
Lots of things. Her favorite yogurt. The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...

## Hold that thought. Are we being shot at?
That was close...

## Damn, Ford, you're the most cynical man in the industry and that's not easy.
What did these Vancouver factories do?

## G'day, they say it's worth three grand...
Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya?

## Fucking Australians! I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
Let's just declare war on the hellhole. Before they make Crocodile Dundee three.

## I love you, too, baby. He wants to meet at six. What time is it now?
That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky...

## So what about this watch?
Keep it. It's your paycheck this month.

## You're a fucking gentleman. What do you want from me?
This Colleen Sutton woman I'm with. If she flees me to go powder her whatever, I need you to keep tabs...

## Shut up, goodies from the ice queen.
You going to be okay?

## How'd you get this from her?
You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...

## What did you... Hey, where's your spex?
Contacts.

## I don't know, what was the case?
Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl. Period.

## You okay?
Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.

## Who?
Ah, an obvious choice.

## Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
Johnny's C.D.?

## Yeah, Colleen mentioned it. What do they make?
C.D.s. The music kind. From the Grendel label.

## How much?
Three hundred.

## Zuzu Petals! Zuzu Petals! Yes! Who killed Bobby Vomit? Who killed Johnny Crunch? Why do people want you so goddamn bad?
I don't know. I'm so scared. Help me.

## Hello?
Give me your gum and grab the wheel.

## You okay?
Peachy.

## Why are all these people after me?
I'm so sure! I'm an only child and my parents are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana. They run a hardware store and...

## Because I know rock-n-roll.
You hung out with Bobby Vomit. Who would want him dead?

## No. Who's Art Mooney?
He's the lamest clue I've ever had in my life. Here's our stop...

## You didn't ask. Have you ever thought about mousse?
Zuzu, wake up...

## Are you okay?
I know the feeling. This must be hell. Can you believe, a flucking sorority... I'm gonna vomit Day-Glo.

## I'm afraid so, you want her?
Ye-ah.

## Why have you come to my planet?
Ick.

## I won't ask why you would want to help someone trying to kill you, but hey, good job. Shall we?
Hey. God. You're an asshole.

## Are you okay?
There's that question...

## So, Zuzu. Are you okay?
Yeah, Ford. I'm okay.

## Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?
Tell me, Dr. Watson, what makes you think he's not just another piece of shit overdose.

## When you going to let me work with you? Why you always fucking with me?
Why am I what? Excuse me? I catch you saying the F-word again. I'll kill you. That's a fucking promise. Now get the fuck out of here.

## Twelve pack?
This ain't no social call. One hundred bucks. To find my father.

## Did he just say what I think he said?
I've got a clue. Look at my ring. Before my old lady ran off to Baja, she told me my dad had this same ring.

## Shut up, you dummy. Who did this to you?
Run to the nearest phone and call the police.

## Where's my father? Have you even looked?
Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...

## So, did you find my dad?
Well, I got some good news and some bad news.

## What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?
Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk. Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit.

## Who's my real father, man?
He, he, lives in South America... he's doing that anthropologist- archeologist-dentist kind of thing ... he's real busy.

## What are you running from?
Why shucks, Lt. Anus, you told me to get the fuck out of here...

## Really?
Let me go out like a man.

## I was just discussing this whole Vomit thing with my friend Art Mooney. Do you know him?
Well, hello, Ford.

## Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end. Isn't your enjoyment impaired?
Don't worry I can run every ballet note for note in my brain...

## And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
Golly, I'd probably faint.

## It's 7,30. You really should get a watch.
It doesn't have to be like this?

## What about Don?
Kill them. Not quickly.

## Are you okay?
When I say 'no,' run for the door.

## What is this, are you holding a microphone behind my head?
Man, Julian, that accident took away more than your hearing.

## Do you really know everybody in the industry?
Only on a first name basis.

## You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right? Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
I'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff.

## What?
So...

## What's my name?
Doyle.

## What?
Mr. Doyle.

## What about you? Can you stand a toss?
I'm clean.

## You don't use shit?
No.

## Did I say you could move that hand -- I'm not gonna get stuck am I?
No - no.

## How's everything?
Everything is everything.

## Boca?
B.O.C.A.

## What?
Coming in this week, week after. Everybody going to get well.

## Where do you want it?
This side.

## Where are you?
Takin' care o' business, honey.

## Well try, okay?
Don't forget anchovies.

## I don't...
What's your name, asshole?

## Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

## Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
No... yeah...

## Did you ever sit on the edge of the bed, take off your socks and stick your fingers between your toes?
Man, I'm clean.

## You made three sales to your roaches back there. We had to chase you through all this shit and you tell me you're clean?
Henri c'est gentil d'tre venu. Je vous prsente mon associ, Pierre Nicoli. Henri Devereaux.

## Did you pick up the car?
It is waiting for you in the garage.

## Did they follow you?
I wasn't looking.

## Are you having trouble raising the half million?
Hell no -- my end is covered -- my associates just feel we ought to wait for a more opportune time to make the switch.

## Je peux l'ouvrir tout de suite?
Si tu veux.

## Formidable! Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker. Je suis pass voir Franoise.
Pour moi?

## Comment va-t-elle?
Je n'ai jamais vu tant de srenit. Elle m'a demand de tes nouvelles et si nous tions heureux.

## Not any woman, Marie. Just one.
Le sommes nous?

## Are you sure it is dead?
I'm going to put them on the cat.

## What happens to the schedule?
We must follow it.

## But will they?
I don't know. Boca is scared. He's not strong enough. He sees policemen in his soup.

## Who financed it?
If this bridge were in Europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list.

## What's your story?
Gimme a break, Mr. Russo. I'm in show business.

## What?
Get up on the bar and show me how you work. If I like it you don't have to go in.

## Perhaps he's visiting a guest.
You're for real?

## No, I figure he stays here. Where's your registration?
There may be two... no, three who could fit it.

## Where from?
Des Moines.

## What's he do?
Businessman. Owns a department store in Des Moines, I think.

## Yeh? Who else?
And a Mr. Michael Lowenstein, I don't know what he does.

## This Charnier guy. He's in shipping?
I think so. But they're in Room 408. On the fourth floor.

## Where's he from?
That's in France.

## What about you, Doyle? Who's the best fighter you ever seen?
Willie Mays.

## What ya doin' out so late? Hidin' from the cops?
I hear the health department is going to close this joint for selling dirty beer. I come by to help you carry out your money.

## Strike out, eh?
Yeah. In the late innings. Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.

## When ya go back on?
Morning. Sometime.

## Who's on him?
Why don't you do the same, Doyle? You look like shit.

## How about that time you were picking your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Havin' trouble? You're a dumb guinea.

## Never trust anybody. You goin' sick?
Not a chance.

## Come on -- one drink. Whatta you say?
Drink this.

## Who is that guy?
Policy man in Queens.

## No, you?
Hunh-uh. Check the bread. He spreads it like the Russians are in Jersey.

## Give who a tail?
The greaser with the blonde.

## Monica? Who's Monica?
A and A, that's all you're interested in -- Arrests and Ass.

## Suspicion of what?
Makin' wine in the basement. He looks like that wop stooge used to drive for the Fracisi brothers.

## Why not?
Let yourself in.

## What happened to you?
The crazy kid handcuffed me to the bed. With my own cuffs.

## You got the warrant?
We also got Bill Mulderig and Phil Klein.

## Throw 'em in the bathroom, will you? How good are the warrants?
Sixty days. Here. Don't mention it.

## You want the red or the white?
Pour it in your ear.

## What about Sal?
We put him to bed for the night.

## Timezit?
Four.

## Where'd you get this fag shit?
This is what the tough guys are wearin'. You know I only steal from the best. It's Bonwit Teller.

## Just for mistakes of parking?
No. Many are involved in crimes and confiscated... or just abandoned. This is, as you know, your prime source of scrap metal, M. Charnier.

## Why is it called Hellgate?
The river at this point is the most dangerous on the East Coast. Years ago, hundreds of ships went down here.

## What is that old building?
Oh, it's been abandoned for years.

## What was it?
It was a crematorium.

## For garbage?
For dead bodies.

## You go to Xavier High School, Daryl?
Yeah.

## What are you saying?
You know what I'm saying.

## So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?
Yeah.

## I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North. You mind I take a shot at him?
That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.

## They around?
Just missed Deleon. Hayes is up in the squad.

## Where's the collar, in the cells?
No, I think he's up in interrogation.

## Why haven't they killed the juice?
Switches are shorted out.

## How do we get to the vault door?
There's a manhole at Canal and Bowery.

## The game, Graham. The Series?
Oh, yeah. Damn. My watch is busted.

## I seem nervous, huh?
Frank. We gotta go back. Frank...

## Frank. Hey, man. You alright?
I'm alright, Gibby.

## You okay, man?
Elvis has left the building.

## Well, why not a little of the King?
Damn.

## You alright?
I think I ruined the sauce...again.

## What's the matter, Jules? Trouble workin' an eight hour shift, watching the kid and whipping up a little bolognese?
You didn't marry Donna Reed.

## How was your tour?
The usual.

## Did he?
He did.

## Frank...what's wrong?
Nothing. I just wanted to see you.

## Where's Johnny?
I tucked him in at Gordo's.

## One in each ear. What would you do without me?
Probably marry some rich doctor and never have to work...

## Do you know how much I love you?
There's something I gotta take care of. Something I need to tell you about.

## The future guy?
Yeah, but, no kidding around, he's a good guy, a real good guy...

## What is going on here, Satch? What are those guys doing out there?
I think you know, Frank.

## About what?
Let's go. Do us both a favor.

## Do you know where I found this?
415 Greenwich St. 302. Under the body of a murdered woman.

## Uh, huh... Uh, huh. And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?
As nuts as that sounds, yes.

## Satch, would you listen to me here. Just you and me. Can I talk to you here, alone?
Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.

## How's that?
Frank, please...

## You ready?
Name's John.

## Are you licensed to broadcast, buddy?
Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.

## Where are you transmitting from?
Queens, New York.

## Sorry 'bout that. So Queens, you psyched for the Series?
I don't really follow baseball anymore.

## What?
I got fed up with all the bullshit.

## I'm right with you, man. He's got the heart of a lion. Hey, how 'bout the first game of the Series?
Yeah. It was all over after Buford nailed Seaver's first pitch outta the park.

## Huh?
The World Series. You called Buford's homer.

## This afternoon?
Sorry 'bout that.

## What'd you just say?
Oh, that was my kid.

## You call your son Little Chief?
Uh huh...

## What'd you say your name was?
Frank...Frank Sullivan.

## Is this some kind of joke? Gordo is that you? Are you fucking with me?
Look pal, I'm just askin' how you...

## You're telling me your name is Frank Sullivan, you live in Queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 Series...live?
Right...and I'm asking how you called the game.

## What'd you say your station...uh, your call letters were?
W...B...2...YXB.

## What?
29-years ago.

## 29 years...?
What the hell...

## What's going on?
Nothing...I just spilled something.

## What?
You just burned the desk.

## What's happening?
That's impossible.

## How could this be happening?
I don't know.

## Sun spot?
Yeah, that's how Hams work.

## You sound...ground up...?
I'm thirty-five years old.

## It's really you, isn't it?
Yeah...I think so.

## Too busy playin' ball, huh?
Nah, I gave it up.

## You're still my Little Chief, right?
I'm trying to be, Dad. I'm tyrin'. It's good to hear your voice. I missed you...so much.

## What's that?
I think I'm losing you.

## What are you talking about?
I lost you.

## What?
I never knew you, Dad.

## Why?
Fire.

## On the job?
That can't be...that's not gonna happen.

## When?
October 12, 1969.

## Chief?! Is that you?
Yeah, it's me.

## Dad, you there? You okay?
Yeah. I'm okay. What about you? I want to know. About you. And your mom.

## What, Johnny? What is it?
What it was like when you died in the fire...

## Are you alright\"?
Something happened, something...

## What? Johnny, what's wrong?
It's Mom.

## What? What is it?
She's not here.

## Whatta you mean she's not here?
She...she died. It's like it just happened.

## She just died, your mother just died?
No Dad, it happened a long time ago, a long time ago for me.

## When?
October 22, 1969.

## Murdered? Why?
What kinda twisted animal.

## What are you talking about?
I gotta take her away, John. I'm gonna take your mother away. He can't hurt her if I take her away.

## I don't know... What about the other women?
I'll warn them.

## So what should I do? Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad. You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.

## What do I tell them?
Tell 'em there's a homicide in progress... cause by the time they show up there will be.

## Did you see him? Do you know who he is?
No. I just kept talking to her. There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em.

## Whatta we do now?
Got it.

## How?
All right, I'm with you. I just hope we know what the hell we're doing.

## What else, John. It must be different, huh? Are people living on the moon?
Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here.

## What are we like in...1998?
We're okay...we're good, Dad.

## You really wanna know?
Yeah, you betcha.

## You there?
John, say hello to my wife...Julia.

## John, you still there?
I'm right here, Dad.

## You all right?
Yeah, I think so...

## But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
Johnny, I know, but...

## What?
He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.

## He took your wallet?
No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.

## He touched your wallet! Where's your wallet?
His prints. You've got his prints. I'll run them through criminal index. You gotta get me that wallet.

## How the hell am I gonna do that?
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.

## Huh?
It's gonna work, Dad. We're gonna stop him.

## Dad, what the hell is going on?
Just a minute, John...okay? Don't go away.

## Yeah, Dad. What the hell is going on?
Satch is busting me for Sissy Clark's murder. John...

## Sully! Is that you?
Hey, Sull. My cable's out again.

## Hey, OK if Gordy uses your old gear?
I think it's somewhere in the closet... if you can find it.

## Go in where?
The warehouse. Buxton seeds. It's tomorrow.

## How you feeling?
Better.

## My father didn't die in a fire?
Fire? What are you talking about? He had cancer, John.

## Cancer. It was the cigarettes. Right? The cigarettes?
Yeah, lung cancer. Ten years ago.

## Huh?
The Ham radio. That's how come he didn't die in the fire.

## How'd you know my name, mister?
I better give you my address then.

## Another rough night, huh? That it?
Yeah. That's it.

## So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street. Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
Not the first time that's been true. I'm telling you, I got a feeling about this guy. This is the guy, Satch.

## What?
I'm just trying to figure what interests me more, the possibility that Daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the guy.

## Got a minute?
Yeah. Sure.

## Close.
So how are things at the hospital?

## So how'd you like LION KING?
Oh, I loved it. I wish you'd gone.

## Hey, future boy. Frank tells me you're a cop?
Yeah, that's right.

## Are you a good cop, John?
I try to be.

## Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?
No. No. Well, sort of. In my heart. Been dead 29 years.

## No. What house you work?
The 2-3. Homicide.

## A hot shot, huh?
Nah, just working the job.

## No kiddin'?
Huh.

## Who are you?
I'm the train wreck you didn't see coming. And I'm gonna steal your life away. You went down 30 years ago. You just don't know it yet.

## Who the fuck is this?
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.

## My name is Abel. And I am my brother's keeper.
Sullivan?

## What is that?
I found this today. There were other pieces of the body lying there, but I believe \"he\" wanted me to have this...

## ... One thousand twelve... one thousand thirteen... one thousand fourteen... What's the World's Record for this?
According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.

## What're you gonna do?
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

## So what would a weekend in the country be without sex?
Cool it, Andy.

## Why don't we go take a swim?
I don't know...

## What're you doing?
We haven't looked in the barn, yet. Let's take a look.

## How about a roll in the hay?
You can play with yourself, 'cause I'm going in the house.

## How about you and I whacking a couple of balls around?
If you insist.

## How do we do it?
First we take off our clothes, then you get on top of me or I get on top of you...

## Think you can figure it out?
I'll think of something.

## That was the best yet. Was it you... me... or the hammock?
I vote for me.

## What're you doin'?
I think it's called \"a shower\". You might try it sometime.

## Hey Deb... can you hear me?
Barely.

## Do you want a beer or not?
Sure.

## I can't find the bong anywhere. Can't you remember where you dropped it?
I can't even remember what day it is, man.

## Will you come with me?
Be a man, man.

## Which one is it?
It's the last house on the left. She lives downstairs.

## What are they saying?
I don't know. I flunked Spanish.

## What's this?
Your bed.

## Have you ever made love in a hammock?
Derek... stop.

## Why?
You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.

## I'm sorry. I just wanted to surprise you. What can I say?
You can say... \"Hello, how are you?\"... for starters.

## Hello. How are you?
You haven't changed a bit. Always so sure of yourself. Even when we were kids, when you wanted something, nothing could stop you.

## Is that so bad?
I don't know.

## What?
Nothing.

## Did you stay here last night?
No. I got here just before you did.

## Are you all right, Shelly?
Let's spread out and check all the rooms. Outside, too. You stay with me.

## What do you mean?
The quiet can fool you. It fooled me. You can never be sure of what's out there.

## Why did you come back here?
... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.

## I don't know. I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us. How do I break through?
I'm trying. I'm really trying.

## What happened that night?
You promised you'd never ask me.

## Could we move a little faster?
Sure, just watch where you're going.

## You know him?
Sort of.

## You're Shelly?
I'm sorry.

## What d'ya got in there?
My whole world.

## In that little thing?
Stick around and you'll see.

## Why don't you help us?
Uh... I guess I'm just not hungry.

## Come on, Shelly. Who else is gonna give him a lift?
Not us! He's really creepy.

## Is... is everything all right?
Everything's gonna be fine.

## Are they following us?
Just a dirty window. Next time, I'll know how to handle a situation like that. Let's just hope that \"next time\" isn't too soon.

## Got any good ideas?
Maybe.

## No time to explain. Just listen. When I yell \"stop,\" you jam on the brakes as hard as you can. Okay?
You're the boss.

## Look at it this way... things can only get better... Right?
We had a slight misunderstanding with that motorcycle gang... ... but Shelly made them see the error of their ways.

## Who's Horace?
My friggin' stepfather and asshole- in-residence.

## What?
Go out and plug the cord back in.

## Well, who told me to take this cow path?
You admit the sign did say \"Camp Forest Green,\" with an arrow pointing this way.

## He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
But that's no what worries me the most...It's how far he'll go to try and prove it.

## Is that all you found?
I wish it was.

## Whaddya mean?
Happy Friday the 13th.

## Jason who?
Megan, get away from him. He's dangerous.

## How do you know? Did you take his temperature?
You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.

## What it is?
Not what...who. Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.

## I thought Jason was only a legend?
He is. Only Tommy wants to prove the legend is true... ...You stay put. And I'm not kidding.

## Can't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right?
We have! Trying to track you down. The phone there is disconnected.

## Daddy, what is going on?
And make sure my daughter stays put... ...She's grounded.

## What?
Hide it behind the gas station. Then we can get the hell out of here.

## Didn't you say you needed some supplies to do this?
Uh...yes. But...

## There...Ya happy?
No.

## Why?
Cause it stinks.

## Lake Forest Green?
Crystal Lake...where the nightmare began.

## They did show up. Isn't that great?
I hope so.

## So what happened?
There was this monster. He was after me. He wanted to kill me.

## Okay, listen...what's your name, sweetie?
Nancy.

## ...Good. So no more bad dreams can come around here, huh?
No more.

## Where'd you get this?
I found it outside.

## Why?
Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.

## Are they grown-ups?
That's debatable.

## Huh?
I can't believe no one called back. I better...

## But what if they try and scare us?
We'll scare 'em right back.

## Shhh...You know what I used to do when I was a little girl when I got scared?
It's just that Darren and Lizbeth are in charge of organizing and setting up the new campgrounds.

## So where's Cort gone off to?
Are you ready? He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.

## Which is?
Boy scouting.

## No...Did Megan say when she's coming back from her...visit?
Hi. Everything's all right now. We're here.

## What's goin' on?
I think somebody's messin' around out there.

## Hold it. Whoa... What's your name, son?
Tommy Jarvis. We gotta do something. He's even more powerful now that...

## And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?
Yes, but they released me because...

## -- yeah, yeah, yeah. You just have your hundred grand ready. For that you get the machete...the mask...the whole damn thing.
Mr. Duke, how can you claim that Jason Voorhees is not truly dead?

## Diana -- you heard from Jessica lately?
Yes.

## The what?
Save your...

## Anything else?
Yes.

## What do you want?
You know what I want. You know why I need you.

## Everything going okay?
It's going.

## Legs giving you trouble?
Not so bad, today.

## Do you have to ask?
Ed...

## Okay. So how is Jessica? You talked to her lately?
Yeah, she's good, considering. That kid just takes everything in stride.

## What's the problem here?
N...nothing.

## Why did you want her body?
For a good reason.

## Does he know about what happened?
Yeah. Sit down a second. There's something I need to tell you about Steven...

## I mean, how can you go through life without never having made a prank call?
Steven, c'mon, we're not thirteen...

## Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony -- did you fuck my dog?
Oh my God, Steven.

## Wanna know how I did that?
Yeah...

## Well?
Okay.

## How many times do you want to hear this?
Until I hear the truth.

## About what?
About Jessica.

## What do you mean you've never made a prank call?
Never.

## You mean never as in really never, or never as in it was just so stupid you don't want to tell us about it?
I mean really never.

## Have you seen Tamara?
No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.

## Really?
I'm sure we'll have no problem getting them to party with us...especially with this.

## He bought you that?
More or less. It's part of my college fund.

## What are you going to do?
Improvise, of course.

## You're joking, right?
No thanks.

## You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?
I guess not.

## What are you going to do?
That was truly excellent.

## Well...how do you feel?
Ask me in about five minutes.

## What's wrong?
Nothing.

## What murders?
Never mind, you don't want to know about it.

## I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
Right.

## Hear what?
All right, all right -- I'm a major ass.

## And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
No.

## Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. McCulloch?
Rennie's not coming.

## Where's the radio?
It's...dead.

## Christ...where's Rennie?
She's...she's dropping the anchors. I thought the Coast Guard could find us easier if...

## What's that?
Perfectly.

## What are you doing in here?
Nothing.

## Where did you get that alcohol?
I packed it. Just for us.

## DEUSEN Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked in?
Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.

## DEUSEN Where is she?
I demand to know what is going on...

## DEUSEN What are you doing?
DEUSEN He's doing the best he can, Charles.

## What did you do with Rennie?
DEUSEN Nothing! I went to her cabin and...

## Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
You've been coming out here every summer for the last three years, young lady, and you still haven't learned how.

## Why are you doing this to yourself?
Facing your fear doesn't always conquer it.

## Can't we at least talk about it?
I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.

## But what about the drowning boy I've been seeing?
Whatever you've been...imagining... has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees. I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's all I care about.

## DEUSEN Everything okay?
Just felt a little chill.

## Really?
DEUSEN Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody.

## That's wonderful, Miss Van Deusen...what's it about?
Yeah...a lot.

## DEUSEN Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him.

## DEUSEN When did this start?
About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school.

## DEUSEN Did you have an accident in the lake?
No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.

## What is your location?
I...I don't know...

## Is your ship equipped with Omega satellite navigation or LORAN?
Yes...

## Can he really take us home?
Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for. But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you.

## What about you?
I don't know...we've gone off course or something...

## What do you mean?
I think so. But we have to lower the anchors so we don't drift any further...

## Rennie...?
The window...

## Is the ship going to sink?
Drugs... Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.

## Where you're going, mister?
I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big hospital in USSR. This hospital, I'm not kidding.

## What did you find?
Big mess every time.

## You are going where?
Crosstown.

## What do you mean, we must abandon?
Ruptured steam pipe.

## Guys ready to order?
Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables.

## Elliot?
This is a great young out-of-work actress.

## That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.

## But didn't we know it would happen?
Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.

## Joanna Bourne. So rich and crisp. This woman lets you touch her body? You put your hands on her personal parts?
Very dangerous.

## What do I exude?
Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.

## Tonight. What's tonight?
Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.

## And he was there?
Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of this review.

## What was it like?
I said, `I'm dead'. He killed me.

## Do we care?
I think we Nought to wait.

## You say we go?
Do not inhale.

## Where are you going?
Don't wait Efor me.

## What about the haircut?
He carries a gun.

## Where is it?
I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now.

## We're talking about something deeper than grudges. How do we respond to personal attack?
In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives.

## What?
There are things that speak to us from the past.

## Shoot him, Nicky. Not that we really mean it. But where does he live?
Keep going west. Last building before the river.

## What do you mean?
About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who.

## Yes. What are you implying?
Of course I saw it.

## Did you see the winning run score?
You're not making sense. Make sense.

## Does what feel comfortable?
This could be it.

## What about her?
She's dying.

## Can he get through it?
They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.

## About what?
Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.

## Because we're completely mismatched.
What?

## The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918. You expect me to miss that for an opening night?
It makes me so mad. Steven Schwimmer ready to strike. The exterminating angel.

## I never see you anymore. Where are you all day?
I go to college. I thought you knew.

## Do you want to get some coffee?
I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.

## So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
That's completely crazy.

## If lawyers for the mob are called controversial, why are divorce lawyers called prominent?
Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.

## Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
I didn't turn her into Mother. You did.

## I know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition?
Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it.

## Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
I'm not sure.

## What will we talk about?
Everything.

## Will I believe you when you tell me something?
There's nothing left for me to lie about.

## Why won't you tell me your name?
It's only our first date.

## What else?
Packs an emotional wallop.

## What else?
A flat-out hit.

## What do we want?
Mystery. Deception.

## What's sexy?
Knowing who a person is. Down deep.

## Am I really so deeply repugnant?
Yes. And no more evasive tactics.

## What else?
An artistry and sensitivity you've never shown before.

## All right. What's been going on?
I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.

## How prominent?
He has his own submarine. I'll be getting everything that matters. I'll get New York and I'll get Connecticut.

## Who the hell cares?
The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.

## I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
Joanne Bourne.

## Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.

## What happens if somebody comes in here right now and shoots you?
This place becomes famous. Tour buses. Blind people feeling around for bullet holes in the wall.

## What's it like to shoot somebody?
I respect a kid who does his homework in a taxi. But let's put a lid on the questions.

## What did it say?
A thousand things.

## Who is it?
I'm at the door.

## Where the hell are you?
Right here. At the door.

## What do you want?
It's me. Nicky.

## If it's you, what are you doing here?
I'm on my way to get a haircut.

## Where does Nicky get his hair cut?
It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in.

## Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?
The Red Sox are your problem. I never understood about you and the Red Sox. Everybody rooted for the Yankees.

## Since when did that matter?
Let's not start that again.

## Where's your elastic brace?
I can't find it.

## What do you want me to do?
Show him who we are.

## Everybody else does. Why not you?
You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.

## Oh yeah?
Some little kid stole the hubcaps.

## The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.

## How come you got the kid with you?
Matthew's my grandson.

## What am I doing?
You're charming the boy.

## I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over.

## Why do you care?
The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one.

## And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?
You're out of bullets.

## So what happened since? You're worried about this kid who writes these reviews?
m not worried about this kid.

## How come?
Have to hurry back.

## Eleventh inning. What else?
Game six is history,pal.

## What do you mean?
To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding.

## Why?
Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business.

## What was your favorite color crayon, growing up?
Burnt sienna.

## And the Father replies?
That's the line I can't ever, for the life of me remember. I just can't get it.

## What's good?
We have a very nice pasta today. Alla Putanesca.

## I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?
There was a review.

## A little drastic maybe?
Say it again.

## What?
You know what.

## You keep slipping away. How do you do that?
I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.

## Would you like to meet him?
He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue.

## Is what true?
He wears a disguise.

## Do you think he can do it?
I don't know.

## Where are you going now?
Home.

## Someone waiting for you?
No one's waiting.

## If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what?
So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.

## Is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that?
No. That is what you get for distracting me.

## What do you expect when you talk like that?
I expect you to show as much patience as I am now.

## Let me hang on with two hands or I will fall.
That was lucky.

## Not quite. They're only \"holding me\" until the Magistrate's hearing. Then it will be prison.
What are you doing?

## Did they take your clothes?
If I want to be one with them, I have to live like them.

## How does a reporter in Central America learn that Gandhi was born in Porbandar anyway?
Oh, I've been a Gandhi buff for a long time.

## You mean Gandhi?
Back in South Africa... long time ago.

## What was he like?
Lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out.

## What'd he say?
He said he's in charge...

## Excuse me, baas, but how long have you been in South Africa?
A -- a week.

## What can we do?
We must end the campaign.

## And Jinnah?
He's waiting. He's not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think.

## What do you want?
That the fighting will stop -- that you make me believe it will never start again.

## There are unjust laws -- as there are unjust men.
Hm. And what should an \"important professional\" write about your response to General Smuts's new legislation?

## Well, it's quite a place, your \"ashram\" -- is that right?
That's right. The word only means \"community.\" But it could stand for \"village\"... or the world.

## Hm. Is it?
Perhaps. I've come here to think about it.

## Do you remember much of South Africa?
A great deal.

## Is it over if they arrest you now?
Not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand. It is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns.

## Are you going to walk all the way?
My name is Walk-er. And I intend to report it the way it is.

## Do you find me stubborn?
I don't know... I know you are right. I don't know that this is right.

## You mean a general strike?
After what they did at the massacre -- it's only an eye for an eye.

## Who is that young man?
I must say when I first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay I never thought I'd be greeting you as a national hero.

## You mean you employ Mr. Baker as your attorney, but you can't walk down the street with him?
I can. But I risk being kicked into the gutter by someone less \"holy\" than Mr. Baker.

## Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon?
I -- I will write to the press -- here -- and in England. And I will use the courts.

## I don't know who they've left out there to do the work. There can't be one mine left open. Have they touched the women?
Thank you. No.

## Perhaps some tea?
I dined at the prison.

## Assuming we are in agreement?
Yes -- yes. It's just that... in these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to go by taxi.

## And that's the basis of this \"Declaration of Independence\"?
OFFICER ...There's been no time to keep figures, but there must be ninety -- a hundred thousand under arrest. And it still goes on.

## He's addressed this letter directly to you, has he?
Thank him for his letter, and put him in jail.

## Ah -- we should invite Gandhi. What the devil has happened to him anyway?
He's \"discovering\" India.

## Have you read his magazine?
No -- but I think I'm going to.

## Have you found him?
...an eye for an eye making the whole world blind.

## Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail?
It's for the best.

## Well? You have all the answers. How is that possible?
You didn't beat me that day. I beat myself.

## Who are you trying to convince?
I will prove it to you. Come swim with me now, Vincent. Now--tonight.

## How are you doing this, Vincent? How have you done any of this?
Now is your chance to find out.

## Is there any reason you'd want a left-handed child?
Er, no...

## How much extra?
It would be five thousand more.

## No? What's keeping you?
I guess I'm a slow learner.

## Grudges?
So there's a 20 percent chance he's not dead.

## Even if this Vincent Luca is alive, is it likely he could bludgeon a man to death?
Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir? I mean besides what's on his sheet.

## Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies. Do you need any more than that?
With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes. Maybe he's just unlucky.

## A customer? Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
No. But one or two \"borrowed ladders\" have shown up there in the past.

## Where do we start?
We'll vacuum these streets if we have to.

## How often do you test, Director?
Often.

## Would you care to look--in the telescope?
Thank you, no.

## Jerome--?
Hello, sweatheart. Come on up.

## Now you're here. Who are your \"friends\"?
It's about the Director.

## Again?
That's where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded.

## I've been looking for him. Do you know where he is?
He's probably leaving some more of me around the place before he goes.

## What's wrong with him?
You have more in common than you know.

## Okay, how tall did you used to be?
Six one.

## What's wrong with it?
I think I'd better choose the menu. After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be you.

## Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
German.

## What about this?
Wrong color. It's silver. It's not easy living up to this.

## You really need that much?
More than that. You'll get used to it.

## God, you're serious, aren't you?
It's not too late to back out.

## What about you? What's in this for you, Eugene?
Listen, I bag this stuff anyway. It may as well pay my rent.

## Who died?
The Mission Director.

## This calls for a celebration. Doesn't it?
The place is crawling with Hoovers.

## So what? You didn't kill him, did you?
And drinking it. It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.

## What is that one?
11.15 to the port. A maintenance crew.

## How long do you stay up there before you go?
A day or so.

## Any particular reason?
We can't stay here.

## What are you talking about?
They think I offed the Director.

## What makes them think that?
They found my eyelash.

## Where?
In a corridor.

## And keep your lashes on your lids where they belong. How could you be so careless?
I'm sorry. I think I was crying.

## You really had other offers?
I'm sure I could have.

## Is that all?
I've got enough on my mind without that.

## How was your evening?
Complicated. I couldn't stop her apologizing.

## You're not thinking of telling her, are you?
Of course not. But she's have to know eventually.

## Where are we going?
I'm sorry. I've got plans.

## Again?
She's already got her doubts. I have to act like nothing's wrong.

## Where are you taking her?
Michael's.

## Will you be okay?
Don't worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I'm looking forward to having the place to myself.

## I guess I'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer.
How long?

## How are you, Jerome?
Not bad, Jerome.

## Why have you done this?
In case you get back before I do.

## Where are you going?
I'm travelling too.

## First, we may as well decide on gender. Have you given it any thought?
We would like Vincent to have a brother... you know, to play with.

## Anything I've forgotten?
We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children. We'd like grandchildren.

## What will happen to the others?
They are not babies, Maria, merely \"human possibilities\".

## What do you think?
I think I could do something provided you know what you're doing and you can meet the terms.

## German, is that you?
Yeah.

## How tall are you?
You can wear lifts.

## Why not?
These new personality corrections I've been reading about.

## You worried about the cost?
Not that.

## A fingerprint. There's something to be said for nostalgia. What did you find?
No bother.

## Can that be, er, verified? Were you alone?
No it can't be verified. Yes I was alone.

## Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene? What about you? Where were you last night?
I was at home.

## Were you alone?
Yes.

## I have better things to do this week than answer the foolish questions of some flatfoot. Don't you?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything.

## Friend?
It was a mercy-killing after all.

## Where?
In the South Wing.

## Does it have a name?
Just some In-Valid. Vincent-- --somebody.

## You didn't know?
Yes...yes...

## What exactly is wrong?
Of course I think about it every day.

## What is this place?
You've never been here? Let me order for you.

## Why are we leaving?
Those checks take forever.

## What about the car?
Let's walk.

## Who are they?
It's not safe. I shouldn't have brought you here.

## What happened?
You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender. Looked right instead of left.

## But \"if it came to it\" then it couldn't have your-- --nose. How perfect does your child have to be?
That's precisely what scares--worth a Goddamn.

## What is it?
I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later.

## Jerome...never shy. Pisses on command. You've got a beautiful cock. I ever told you that, Jerome?
Only every time I'm in here.

## What's this, Lamar?
New policy.

## Flight got you nervous?
There's a problem, Lamar.

## What are you doing?
I can't do this.

## What about them?
They're mine. The one with the moustache is my brother. They stay out of it. We stay clean.

## Sure, You're working on the passports... ... and visas?
They will be ready. You guys do your job.

## What about your wife?
What about her? Let's c ut up the money, I want to get North.

## What do you add up to here?
One. The radio's rappin' about $750^000. We only got a half a million.

## You okay?
I'm a lot better off than I was an hour ago.

## You want to drive?
My license expired, let's get out of here.

## Feel good?
Yeah.

## Where do you want to go?
I want to take a walk.

## What's Beynon got set up?
Small town, small bank, big money.

## Where did you get those?
I've been doing my homework.

## Just like old times?
Better than old times.

## Where did you get them developed?
Assumed name... Houston.

## What do you want for dinner?
Whisky and a peach.

## How does it taste?
Just the way I remembered.

## You been okay?
Pretty good... Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw my brother and the kids. Figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel.

## How's Estelle?
Fatter... some things never change.

## You go out much?
After four years and now the question comes up.

## Really?
Really.

Yes. I said, \"Not actually.\" The fuck you care, George? We're just talking...

## We are?
Because, because, you know, it's a crime.

What did he say? He'd buy them.

## What will he pay?
A buck a shot.

That's none of your fucking business...

## Is that what I just said?
You need money? Is that the...

## Hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what I need is not the...what do you need...?
What is the five grand? What is the, you said that we were going to split five...

All that I'm saying...

## Under him?
Moss.

## ...let me...are you listening to me...?
Yes.

## You know what those leads cost?
Murray said...

## Why?
The leads are assigned randomly...

## Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... What are you telling me?

## Of what?
And what if you don't close.

## What if you don't close...?
I will close.

Go on, answer him when he talks to you. Tell him, Columbus, Marconi... Garibaldi.

## What took so long?
She couldn't decide.

## What can we do?
Vitone! Our driver has drunk too much wine.

## I know, it was chaos; but anyway, here I am one week late. This is for my Mama. You remember Merle?
Yes, thank you.

## How are the kids?
Well, thank you, they asked for you all week.

## Merle, have you met my sister-in- law Deanna?
How are you, honey? You've met Merle, haven't you. He was with me in Vegas.

## Why do you come to me? Why don't you go to a travel agent?
Michael...

## Is Kay coming?
No.

## Kids, why don't you go outside for a while?
I want to talk to you, Michael.

## I hate to see you cringe in front of him. How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?
He's the head of the family.

## I wanta dance...whatsa matter with that?
Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.

## Would you like some?
No, Dad.

## Now what is this talk about joining the army? Eh?
It's not talk; I'm doing it.

## You would risk your life for strangers?
Not for strangers; for my country.

## 1 Why'd you do it, Frankie? After all these years, why'd you turn against him?
I didn't turn against nobody; he turned against me.

## That's what I'm here to talk to your brother about. What's with him, I got to get a letter of introduction to have a 'sitdown'?
C'mon, I see what I can do.

## Hey Mike, what can I say?
Forget it, just go take care of her.

## Great, Havana's great. Lots of activity in Havana! Anybody I know here. Five-Angels? Anybody?
Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.

## Pentangeli's dead. He was ambushed by the Rosato Brothers. Didn't you know that?
It was hard to have him killed.

## You know otherwise, Freddie?
Me? NO, no, I don't know anything. Fellas! You're all falling asleep. We got to see Superman.

## How is your wife, Fredo...your marriage?
Yo soy un hombre sincero... I am a sincere man, From the land of the palms...

## The song. Are you sincere with me, Fredo?
Sincere. What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.

## ...Who?
The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.

## What do you want me to do?
To go tonight, with me, as though we know nothing. I've already made my move.

## What is it? Can I help?
The old man will never bring in the New Year.

## Nowhere, Mike. I wanted to get a refill. How about you?
I don't have a lot to say, Michael.

## What about now, is there anything you can help me out with?
I know they get Pentangeli, that's all I know.

## There's nothing more you can tell me about this investigation?
The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to Roth.

## He's an Italian?
A pig of a Neaponitan.

## Because he knows them; he knows they have no one to protect them. Vitone? What do you think of my angel?
Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.

## No, I didn't know. Is he dead?
Nah. Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all. Make him look bad.

## Why?
Because he's what we say... connected... You wait, see what happens to those guys from Ninth Avenue.

## And he agreed?
He took the money. Now he wants double from everybody in the neighborhood, including Papa.

## I'm going to see my parents.
Chi?

## How long does this go on?
I don't know. I'm sorry, Kay...

## Am I a prisoner?
That's not the way we look at it.

## Where's my wife?
He doesn't want my help any more. He doesn't need it.

## Hello?
She's gone, Tom.

## What do you mean gone?
Why didn't someone tell me!

## Will you tell him?
I don't know.

## Goddamn it, where were you?
I was in my house. Willy tried, but it would have taken some strong-arm to stop her, and he figured you wouldn't want that.

## Me too, Tom?
Yeah, give me a minute.

## Tom isn't going to sit in with us, Johnny. He only handles specific areas of the family business. Tom?
Sure, Mikey.

## Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
But if you're wrong...

## Do you think they have somebody to back up Cicci?
No. But if they do have somebody, you'll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name.

## Did the boy get something from me for Christmas?
I took care of it.

## Where's my brother?
Roth got out on a private boat. He's in a hospital in Miami. Had a stroke but he's recovered okay. Bussetta's dead.

## I asked about Fredo?
My information is that Fredo thought it was a kidnapping. Roth assured him nothing would happen to you.

## Was it a boy or a girl?
Mike, at three and a half...

## And Kay...she's all right?
She took the Senate Investigation worse.

## Does she blame it on me? The baby?
I don't know.

## How did they get their hands on Pentangeli?
He says he doesn't know anything, and I believe him. Roth played this one beautifully.

## Sit down, Tom. Have you heard about our friend and partner, Mr. Hyman Roth?
I know he's in Israel.

## I'm staying. Don't ever enjoy the cruel part of all this; Sonny never listened to me about that. Now, explain everything to me.
Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?

## Fifteen percent skim?
Twenty-five this time.

## What's up?
No questions.

## How do I know you haven't gone into business for yourself?
He's going to try Panama...

## Did my brother go back?
Yeah, but don't worry.

## Tom, what do I do now?
Frankie, you were always interested in politics, in history. I remember you talking about Hitler back in '43. We were young then.

## What the hell are you talking about?
We know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did. No strings.

## Do you owe markers?
Maybe two, three thousand dollars.

## Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify to this committee that gentleman sitting on your right hand?
Yes, sir. His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.

## Is he related to the witness?
He is, I believe, a brother.

## Whose orders are these?
Mr. Hagen's, ma'am.

## I'm sorry, Michael. Senator Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs. Barrett wanted to thank you before they left. Won't you join us, Mr. Ola?
Mr. Ola's just leaving, Kay. Please tell the Senator I won't be a minute.

## How's the baby?
Sleeping inside me.

## Does it feel like a boy?
Yes, Michael, it does.

## Why don't you sit down?
I'm not going to stay long; I can't.

## Tell me, Michael. What really happened with Pentangeli?
His brother came to help him.

## I didn't even know he had a brother. And where is he now?
On a plane back to Sicily.

## You would have killed his brother?
Right here.

## Who do you think you're talking to?
You said you were Klingman.

## I'm alright. Will you stay home for awhile?
There are still things I have to do.

## Well, we can all have a nice dinner together tonight. How are your eyes?
You talk about the baby. She can have another baby.

## Your family? How can you ever lose your family?
But times are different...

## Sit down, this is almost over. You follow the baseball games?
Not for a few years.

## Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?
It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.

## I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well. As a heavy investor, I'm pleased. How did the doctor find you?
Terrible. I'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting.

## Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
Why...the Rosato Brothers.

## So?
So, that occurred to me.

## How is his health?
Not good.

## Is there anything I can do; anything I can send?
He appreciates your concern, Michael, and your respect.

## Are you the son of Vito Corleone?
Yes.

## Is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in Las Vegas?
That is not true. I own some stock in some of the hotels, but only very small amounts. I also own some American Telephone and IBM stock.

## Mr. Corleone, do you have any hotel interests in the state of Arizona? Or any gambling interests in that state?
I do not.

## When do we talk?
After dinner.

## Says who?
Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched.

## I didn't want you to know I was coming. You heard what happened in my home?
Michael, yes, we was all relieved...

## Michael, anything. What is it I can do for you?
I want you to settle these troubles with the Rosato Brothers.

## Frankie...do you respect me? Do I have your loyalty?
I know.

## Then why do you want me to lay down to them?
Frankie, Roth tried to have me killed. I'm sure it was him, but I don't know yet why.

## And?
No sign of them yet; but they're still on the Estate.

## On the phone?
No, she's here.

## Rosato, where's your brother?
Sitting right behind you.

## He don't want to talk?
We worked it all out beforehand.

## Are we going to eat or what?
Sure, on me. I got Diner's Club.

## You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.

## Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari persu...?
My lawyer went over this beforehand.

## What assurances do I have that there will be no more kidnapping, no more hits?
The same assurance we got from you.

## What if I say shove it?
Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue DeRosa will need to be fitted for slabs.

## You want a war?
He supports me.

## What's this?
That's a lucky C note for our new deal.

## How much more a month?
Eh... Five dollars more.

## I say let loverboy watch his movie. And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn.
What was that?

## What makes you say that?
Just thinking out loud.

## So what did you think?
Weird.

## What's to be jealous of?
I've gotten to know someone who's famous.

## What's that mean?
It means it's too cold to go swimming. And I don't mean the water.

## Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?
It's different. He's a man. And by the way you have no business calling him a homo.

## It never crossed your mind?
I'm not a kid.

## What are you then? What will you be ten years from now? Still cutting lawns? Still banging horny divorcees in your trailer?
I like my life. I'm a free man.

## Is that all this conversation means to you? Am I going to put out or not?
Damn straight. I'm sick of playing games.

## Gimme a break. I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures. Is that going to hurt him?
No. No. I am sorry. Forget everything I say. Here. I will take the tray.

## Something I can do for you?
The Master wants to know if you are free for lunch. I tell him you will be having other plans, but he insists I ask.

## How long you worked for Mr. Whale?
Long enough. Fifteen years.

## No. We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I. People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim. You have people, Boone?
You mean family? All in Joplin, Missouri.

## Your wife?
I'm not married.

## Oh, I don't know. Because no girl in her right mind will have me?
A man who is not married has nothing. He is a man of trouble. You need a woman.

## You ever been married, Hanna?
Of course. I am married still.

## Yeah? What's your husband do?
He is dead now, twenty years.

## You're sure of that?
This is what the priests tell me. His sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven.

## No. His is the worse. The unspeakable. The deed no man can name without shame?
What is the good English? All I know is bugger. He is a bugger. Men who bugger each other.

## Yes! You know?
That is why he must go to hell. I do not think it fair. But God's law is not for us to judge.

## There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
You did not know?

## Maybe. But I still need to talk. Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go?
I blame my daughter for keeping me out so late. I only hope you did not get him excited. It could give him a new stroke.

## What do I do?
Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.

## I put him to bed. He's not there?
I didn't do it. This wasn't me.

## But how're you going to explain this? How did you get him out of the pool?
You are right. Yes. We must put him back.

## And your name is --?
Boone. Clayton Boone.

## I couldn't help but notice your tattoo. That phrase? Death Before Dishonor. What does it mean?
Just that I was in the Marines.

## Everything alright, Mr. Boone?
Just got away from me. Sorry to disturb you.

## Or would you prefer a beer?
No. Iced tea's fine.

## These are your paintings?
What? Oh yes.

## They're just copies then. Gotcha.
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?

## Sure, everybody does. When I was a kid I'd go with my sister twice a week. Why? Were you an actor or something?
In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood. No, I was merely a director here.

## Yeah? What were some of your movies?
This and that. The only ones you maybe have heard of are the \"Frankenstein\" pictures.

## \"Frankenstein\" and \"Bride of\" and \"Son of\" and all the rest?
I made only the first two. The others were done by hacks.

## Merely comfortable. Here's Hanna with our refreshments. Can you get the door?
When they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you. Please, Mr. Boone. Help yourself.

## What did she mean by going flooey?
I returned recently from a stay in hospital.

## What was wrong?
Nothing serious. A touch of stroke.

## You mean, like posed for pictures?
Sat for an artist. Been sketched.

## What's to sketch?
You have the most architectural skull. And your nose. Very expressive.

## But expressively broken. How did it happen?
Football in college.

## You went to university?
Just a year. I dropped out to join the Marines.

## You mean -- you really want to draw me?
Indeed. I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.

## But why?
Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.

## And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?
What are you suggesting? You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.

## You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
I have no interest in your body, Mr. Boone. I can assure you of that.

## Hmmm. I much prefer \"Show Boat\" or \"The Invisible Man.\" Shall we begin?
That shirt, Mr. Boone.

## I'm sorry. It's too white, too distracting. Would it be asking too much for you to take it off?
I'm not wearing an undershirt.

## We could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders. Would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness?
All right already. I'll take it off. Kind of warm in here anyway.

## I'm sorry. I've just realized how terribly ironic it all is.
Your family ate dripping?

## What?
I've spent most of my life outrunning my past. Now it's flooding all over me.

## Do you mind?
Go ahead.

## This David's a friend?
Saw your movie the other night. Watched it with some friends.

## Did you now?
I liked it. We all did.

## Did anyone laugh?
No.

## Did you kill anyone?
I don't like to talk about that.

## Quite true. Hand-to-hand combat is the true test. Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand?
No. I could have, though.

## Yes, I believe you could. How free is your schedule this afternoon?
Full up. I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.

## What is we say phooey to the hedges? Could you spare an hour after lunch? To sit for me?
Can't today.

## You ever been married, Mr. Whale?
No. At least not in the legal sense.

## So you had a wife?
Or a husband. Depending on which of us you asked. My friend David. He lived here for many years.

## Does that surprise you?
No, I -- you're a homosexual.

## What way might that be?
You know. Look at me like -- like I look at women.

## So we understand each other?
What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.

## Can I see what you did so far?
It will only make you self-conscious. You'll have to remove your shirt.

## Tell me more about yourself, Mr. Boone. You have a steady companion?
Not at the moment.

## Why not?
You know how it is. You have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it.

## Is that why you and your friend split up? Because you wanted to be free?
In a way, yes. I suppose so. I know it's why I stopped making pictures.

## Better work.
Do you miss it?

## How long were you...?
You first.

## I'm curious, Mr. Boone. What convinced you to come back?
I don't know. I guess I like your stories.

## And the fear you showed at our last session? How did you overcome that?
Not fear. More like disgust.

## No teammates in football? No comrades in Korea?
You must think the whole world is queer. Well it's not. War sure isn't.

## You were a soldier?
I was an officer.

## No, my dear. The Crimean War. What do you think? The Great War. You had a Good War, while we had --
This was World War I?

## Something happened to him?
You will not set me on another walk down memory lane. Not this lane. Not today.

## Just go. Please. Why don't you go?
I want -- I want...

## You don't want me to sit for you anymore?
If you don't mind driving, I'd like to take you as my guest. There should be lots of pretty starlets to keep you amused.

## Very good, Clayton. May I call you Clayton? Or do you prefer Boone?
Clayton is fine.

## Do I look okay?
I suppose you'd like the top down.

## If that's okay?
Nothing would please me more.

## Who's that?
David. The friend I thought was in New York.

## Is that really her?
David produced her last picture.

## Are you enjoying yourself?
Actually, no. I feel a little out of place.

## Just a night out. Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
Oh fuck. And we left the top down. You want to run for it?

## Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
Good. Let's get dry.

## Ten minutes ago. Didn't you hear me calling?
I'm afraid not. Terribly sorry. I believe I promised you some clothes.

## You don't have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms?
Sorry. My pajamas are tailored. Would it be too distressing to continue with the towel? No more immodest than a kilt, you know.

## Do I have any other choice?
Very sporting of you, Clayton.

## Is that --?
The only memento I ever kept. My original sketch for the Monster.

## After dinner, if Hanna isn't back? Can we try a few more sketches?
I thought you'd given up on my picture.

## Tell me something, Clayton. Do you believe in mercy killing?
Never gave it much thought.

## The Great War?
By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over. He missed out.

## What happened?
I didn't have the guts for it.

## Do you mind?
Not at all.

## You're planning a trip?
Barnett. Barnett on the wire.

## Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling? Grave where thy victory?
You survived it. It can't hurt you now. It's no good to dig it up.

## What'd you say?
No. It won't do.

## What won't do?
You are much too human.

## What did you expect? Bronze?
Don't move.

## Why?
For the artistic effect. The combination of your human body and that inhuman mask. It's quite striking.

## It's from the first World War, isn't it?
There are straps in back.

## What was that?
It's too tight.

## Oh, but you have. You undressed for me. I kissed you. I even touched your prick. How will you be able to live with yourself?
You're crazy.

## You okay?
Oh Clayton.

## Did I hurt you?
Nothing I didn't deserve.

## Need some help?
Pray you, undo this button.

## You ever hear of this Whale fellow?
This kisser wasn't so bad you couldn't lay under it a few times.

## You coming, Boone?
I think I'll hang around.

## Have a drink?
Can't say that I have. Can't say I've heard of a lot of people though.

## If you don't believe me, let's watch this movie. See if his name's on it. How about it, Harry? Can I watch my damn movie?
I told you. I don't turn on the TV except for the fights.

## I just want to watch it, okay?
Sick stuff. Necrophilia. I wonder if they knew how sick they were.

## The Monster's lonely and he wants a friend, a girlfriend, somebody. What sick about that?
Go home, Clay. We're closing up.

## Where's Betty?
She took the night off. Heavy date. Some guy she's had her eye on for a while.

## What are you doing here?
Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.

## Should you be drinking in your condition?
Oh, David, stop being a nanny.

## Oh dear. I'll never work in this town again?
You know what I mean. Your reputation.

## Well the rest of us aren't. Can't you remember that?
No. I never could. You must regret having had the invitation sent.

## Jimmy, there are people here I need to speak to. You'll be fine on your own?
Yes. Perfectly.

## Yes, yes, Dr. Payne. But from the neck up? What's my story there?
That's what I'm trying to explain.

## You're saying there's an electrical storm in my head?
That's as good a way as any to describe it. I've seen far worse cases. You might even learn to enjoy these walks down memory lane.

## So what do I do?
Take the Luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on.

## Uh-oh. The way you look at me, James. What have you done this time?
Bring a mirror. Let the Bride feast upon her visage.

## Boris? Do I look a fright?
And you said there'd be some of me left. Nobody's going to know me in this getup.

## Elsa?
I saw Una O'Conner a few weeks ago. She said you'd been under the weather.

## What's our pesky friend up to now?
Is that Boris? Our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion.

## Hanna? Who's the new yardman?
Bone? Boom? Something Bee. I hire him while you were in the hospital. He came cheap.

## There is iced tea, Hanna? Cucumber sandwiches?
Yes, Mr. Jimmy. An interview. After so many years. Very exciting.

## Yes?
Which ones? I bring them all.

## My mind's lovely. And yours?
You remember what the doctor tells us.

## Oh, that monster. How could you be working with him?
Don't be silly, Hanna. He's a very proper actor. And the dullest fellow imaginable.

## He is not going to kill the old man?
No, Hanna. My heart isn't that black.

## You will take them all, Mr. Jimmy?
I'll be fine, Hanna. Thank you.

## Does the yardman come today?
Of course. This afternoon.

## Who was that at the door?
A visitor.

## Do you miss having someone to talk to, Hanna?
I have my family. Also our Lord Jesus Christ.

## Of course. How is the old boy these days?
It needs a hat. There was a wide-brimmed cream fedora...

## Will that be good for you, Mr. Kay?
Sure.

## So, Mr. Kay? What do you want to know?
Everything. Start at the beginning.

## No. I never said you were. Or will be soon.
How much longer before we get to \"Frankenstein\"?

## I have a proposal, Mr. Kay. This mode of questioning is getting old, don't you think?
I don't mind.

## It is, isn't it? My life as a game of strip poker. Shall we play?
You're serious.

## What rumors might those be?
That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal.

## Can that count as one question?
Of course.

## Just like going swimming, isn't it?
Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through. I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.

## Who came up with the Monster's makeup and look?
I just need to -- lie down. Studio. Daybed in studio.

## Oh my God. What's wrong, Mr. Whale? Is it your heart?
Head. Not heart.

## Mr....Kay?
Bet you thought you'd never see me again. I didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.

## You didn't?
I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list.

## You, Mr. Kay? How do you know George Cukor?
I interviewed him after I met you. I'm his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary.

## My monsters?
Don't go away.

## Fine. Quite fine. And Your Royal Highness?
Splendid. Now that I know you're around.

## Sit?
I've changed my hair, you see. Since our last session. Those old snaps look rather dowdy now.

## Oh dear. Have I made a blunder?
Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine. James Whale.

## He took a job. And he fumbled it. Now he's jammed-up. Jammed-up bad...
How's the leg?

## What kind of job... ?
A boost. A big boost ...

## Don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, Atley...
A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?

## Who do you think?
Car-jacker. Neglected to clean up after himself ...

## What's with the fish thing -- ?
Fish.

## How they were just there ... Waiting on us ... The fix was definitely in ...
You have a Hollandaise sauce ?

## Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead, right?
Point-five ...

## How ya doing?
It's about my brother ... Kip...

## They gave you only four days?
I'm not interested --

## And if he doesn't make it -- ?
I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...

## This is how you're spending my time? Having a sock hop?
Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ...

## Well, that certainly won't do.
This is number 50. We did it. It's over Where's the money ?

## What do you mean -- ?
Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing ...

## How is he?
He'll live. But it means your boy's behind it. Astricky was holding a list. They just faxed it to us...

## What for?
Let them go. And I'll leave ...

## You'll leave -- ?
I don't golf...

## Or your baby brother. What was his name?
Kip.

## And this has what to do with me?
I know you.

## What are you still doing here, Randall?
Stopped by to see Otto. Say hello.

## Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
You're thinking, okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?

## What do you want from me?
Castlebeck.

## What's this -- ?
Cadillac.

## What's wrong with it -- ?
Needs brightening ...

## No faith in our new-found goodness, Detective ...?
Sure. But sometimes we got to create some numbers. The task force is run by statistics, you know ...

## Double-meaning intended, right?
Right ...

## When'd you get to town, Raines?
The other day....

## What for?
No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ...

## Where you been, anyway?
Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...

## How'd it go?
Keys were in it ...

## What's that?
I guess ...

## Very good. Think you can get in without waking her up -- ?
Yeah.

## What's the matter?
It's all microchips and shit ...

## Peugot convertible ...
What about him?

## What color?
Gray.

## You know where the others are?
Forget that ...

## Okay. Figure it forgotten. What's this about anyways -- ?
Most of 'em are late-model...

## How's it going -- ?

## On account of Mitch?
On account of me.

## No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?
Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.

I dunno. I know a place.

## This time it's for real?
Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.

## What -- ?
Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me...

## What's that?
Bench seats.

## Am I dying? Are all the angels of my life returning to bid a final farewell? And have my angels completely lost their fashion sense -- ?
Hello, Otto ...

## The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars? The rolled-back odometers? The part bins?
Tell me...

## I Just don't know how happy they'll be to see me
Is he still working here ?

## And the moral of that story is -- ?
Go to them. They'll be happy to see you ... Ahhh...

## If we put out the word. That we're crewing-up, for a one-time-only job... What do you think that'll yield?
You need him...

## Okay, then... Otto?
In order to succeed, you're going to have to go old-school. one night boost. Put all your nuts in one basket. And...

## Anyone? The significance of \"Robin 1\" on Magnum's license plate? Memphis?
Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the estate they lived on ...

## Split it up. Any word on Donny?
He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.

## What happened to Sway?
She left...

## How old are you now, Toby?
Sixteen. But my birthday's in seven months ...

## What about me?
You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ...

## How come ... ?
You're gonna be okay, Toby... You are ... We'll getcha fixed up...

## Why don't you leave him alone?
I known Kip longing than you, man ...

## What? What happened?
But he was always a bad kid, that one.

## Billy, how are you?
Son of a bitch. Get over here.

## Don't go busting my balls. Okay?
Busting his balls? If I was busting your balls, I'd send you home for your shine box.

## What thing? The Brooklyn thing?
No. No. The guy from downtown.

## The guy from near where Christie used to live?
No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.

## Wha? Me?
Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.

## Why would I get into that?
Paulie. Why would I? I swear.

## You're only home early because we got you a job, right? And I don't need any heat. You understand?
Nods.

## Anybody! You understand?
I understand.

## You think I didn't know what you were doing?
It was easy money. I did it in the can. Shit! I learned the junk business in the can, Paulie.

## You thought I was some fucking jerk?
He watches it for me. It's better than waiting at a garage.

## What do you do?
I'm in construction.

## My bag. My bag.
What are you gonna do?

## What bag?
The bag with the envelopes.

## How much?
I don't care. Something's going on.

## I thought you were supposed to turn yourself in at ten o'clock this morning?
I'm just having my last few drinks.

## What are you talking about?
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.

## With what?
But you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz.

## Hello! Hello! Have a good flight?
Jimmy's calling every day. It's urgent.

## What did he say, exactly?
At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.

## Who's gonna do that?
Just get me out.

## What are you talking about?
You know. The stuff I left.

## You what?
What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.

## What happened? You okay?
I got seared.

What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.

## We got a problem, that thing we took care of upstate?
Paulie was just talking about him.

## What?
The guy just sold the property. They're gonna build condominiums and I don't want anybody digging up the little bastard.

## What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay?
Don't worry about it.

## Paulie's gonna make him?
Who else? Paulie got the okay. This little guinea fuck. Someday he's gonna be a boss. Can you believe someday we'll work for him.

## What'll I tell Fran?
Who gives a fuck? Tall her he ran away with a broad. What do you care about her.

## Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.

## You want the melon?
Nah.

## How?
It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.

## It's a fait accompli?
Done.

## And Jimmy's in it, right?
Will you stop.

## What happened to you?
I can't make any more deliveries.

## Whadda you mean, you can't make any more deliveries? You're going to fuck up everything?
My father got a letter from the school. He said the next time he'll kill me.

## You ready?
Yeah.

## You know what to do?
I gotta go home.

## Do you realize what we're involved in here now?
I don't care. I need my hat. I won't go without it.

## Is it my fault she won't go out without her girlfriend? For Chrissake. Come on. You don't even have to stay. Jeesuz! What's the big deal?
Tommy ...

## Are you okay? What happened?
Nothing. I dropped the soap. That's all.

## How is he? Okay? Are they busting his chops?
He's okay. They sobered him up.

## Did he say what they're asking him about?
Jimmy. I don't know. I got so much else on my mind. I got the kids. We got no money.

## He didn't call?
He's with his friends.

He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.

Ma! Please! You're driving me crazy.

## Ma! Stop! What do you want me to do?
Stayed out? Daddy never went out at all.

## If you knew those fucking kids. They're nuts. Especially that Tommy. What am I going to do with them?

## Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to?
You don't know that.

## You and Morgan throw?
No, I had to talk him down.

## Why didn't you yoke him?
You're kiddin' me.

## What class?
Ah, history I think.

## How you doin'?
Good.

## How'd you know where to find me?
You were the only Sullivan in the phone book.

## This is your house, right?
I guess so.

## Is this a bad time?
Yeah, it is.

## What Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her?
Fuck her.

## How much money you got?
I told you, I just got change.

I think you should establish a good line of credit.

Holy shit.

It's a good thing no one's Irish here.

## Why don't you beat off at your house?
I don't have a VCR at my house.

## What'd you say about me?
Shut the fuck up.

## Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo?
Guy's been up my ass for two years about a fuckin' job. I had to let him help with the car.

## You want us to give you cash right now?

I have about seventy-three...

## What class did you say that was?
History.

## How'd you like that course?
Good, it was all right.

So why do you think I should work for the National Security Agency?

## Okay, you're in your bed, Will. Now how old are you?
Seven.

## And what do you see?
Somethin's in my room.

## What is it?
It's like a small figure, hoverin' over me. Gettin' closer.

## Where is it touching you?
Building two.

## What're you doing?
I'm sorry.

## Fuck do you want?
I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.

## Really?
Yes. Under two conditions.

## If I agree to this, I walk right now?
That's right.

## Okay. How?
It's an integer proof.

## That would be a monumental waste of time, wouldn't it, Will?
I think so.

## It's right. Take it home with you.
What's that?

## Will, what happened at the Tri-tech meeting?
I couldn't go 'cause I had a date. So I sent my cheif negotiator.

## What are you smiling at?
It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card.

## Hey, how you doin'?
You know, you're no longer required to come here.

## Excuse me, Professor Lambeau?
Yes.

## Find out what?
Who proved the theorem.

## Have you heard of Jonas Salk?
Yeah, cured polio.

## How about Gerald Lambeau? Ever heard of him?
No. LAMBEAU Okay thank you, Timmy.

## So who won the bet?
I did.

## Is there someplace we can talk?
I didn't see you at the reunion.

## You were missed. How long has it been since we've seen each other?
Since Nancy died.

## Not much free time, Gerry. LAMBEAU Have you ever heard of a man named Ramanujan?
Yeah.

## Why me?
I need someone with your kind of background.

## My kind of background?
You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston.

## He's from Southie? How many people did you try before you came to me?
Five.

## Not Rick? You didn't send him to Rick?
Just meet with the boy once a week.

## Can we do it at my office?
That would be fine.

## Would you excuse us?
Tom.

## What do you mean \"he didn't talk?\" You sat there for an hour?
No, he just sat there and counted the seconds until the session was over. It was pretty impressive, actually.

## Why would he do that?
To show me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.

## Gerry! Any trouble finding the place?
Not at all.

## You moved?
I been here a couple years.

## Well, have you talked to him at all about his future?
We haven't really gotten into it. LAMBEAU Maybe you should. My phone's been ringing off the hook with job offers.

## Jobs doing what?
He married his cousin.

## Why do you think he does that, Gerry?
He can handle the work, he can handle the pressure and he's obviously handled you.

## Where're you going?
I don't know. India maybe.

## Why there?
Never been.

## Do you know when you'll be back?
I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.

## How about one now?
Sounds good.

## Sean, do you have any idea what the odds are against winning the lottery?
I don't know... Gotta be at least four to one.

## You're pretty quick with those numbers. How about the odds of me buying the first round?
About thirty million to one.

## What do you want to do?
There is somebody...

## Who is he?
He was my roommate in college.

## What should I do?
The boy was here. He came in, sat down and we worked together.

## What happened? You got fired, huh?
Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.

## How fuckin' retarded do you have to be to get shit-canned from that job? How hard is it to push a fuckin' broom?
There goes that fuckin' Barney right now, with his fuckin' \"skiin' trip.\" We should'a kicked that dude's ass.

## Will, I can't believe you brought Skylar here when we're all wrecked. What's she gonna think about us?
Yeah, Morgan. It's a real rarity that we'd be out drinkin'.

## So, you finally got a job Morgan?
Had one, now I'm fucked again.

## So what do you got, a fuckin' Hyundai engine under there? Can I make it back to my house?
That's why I love stock-car racin'. That Dale Ernhart's real good.

## Like what, Will?
I go places, I interact.

## What places?
Certain, clubs. Like, Paradise. It's not bad.

## What?
C'mon, I read your book. I talked to you. It's just something I know to be true.

## Have you read all these books, Will?
Probably not.

## How about the ones on that shelf?
Yeah, I read those.

## I'm not here for a fuckin' book report. They're your books, why don't you read 'em?
I did.

## You think so?
Whatever blows your hair back.

## Free weights. WILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?
285.

## Yeah. Do you paint?
No.

## Crayons?
This is a real piece of shit.

## What does?
The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting.

## What is?
I think you're one step away from cutting your ear off.

## Watch your mouth.
Oh, \"Starry Night\" time, huh?

## That's it isn't it? You married the wrong woman. She leave you? Was she bangin' someone else?
If you ever disrespect my wife again...I will end you.

## So what's with this place? You have a swan fetish? Is this something you'd like to talk about?
No.

## I know, but the joke's better if I tell it in the first person.
You've never been on a plane.

## Yeah? You got a lady now?
Yeah, I went on a date last week.

## How'd it go?
Fine.

## Well, are you going out again?
I don't know.

## Why not?
Haven't called her.

## You ever think about gettin' remarried?
My wife's dead.

## Why not?
I gave that up when my wife got sick.

## Is that why you didn't write anything else?
I didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one.

## Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean. All those guys were in your platoon?
Yeah.

## What happened to that guy from Kentucky?
Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I kind of lost touch with him after Nancy got sick.

## You don't regret meetin' your wife?
Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.

## Where were you?
I was havin' a drink with my future wife.

## You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to have a drink with a woman you had never met?
That's right.

## Do you have a soul-mate?
Define that.

## Oh, what? You're going to take the professor's side on this?
Don't give me you line of shit.

## What?
If you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time.

## What?
Well, I'm here. So, is that my problem? I'm afraid of being abandoned? That was easy.

## Do you want to talk about it?
Oh, this is your file. I have to send it back to the Judge with my evaluation.

## --No, have you had any experience with that?
Yes.

## The wrench, why?
Cause fuck him, that's why.

## That's what you want?
Yeah, I think so.

## Thanks you. So, that's it? We're done?
We're done. You did your time. You're a free man.

## Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
Only if you grab my ass.

## What?
I'm Will.

## What?
When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.

## What?
I was trying to be smooth. But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna come over there and talk to you.

## It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description.

## You aren't, by any chance, Pre-law? Are you?
I bet your parents were happy to pay.

## Is Harvard gettin' all that money?
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.

## So you just want to use me and go?
Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.

## In that case, fine. Want to see my magic trick?
Sure.

## Have you ever seen Annie Hall?
No.

## Oh, you will?
No...I was hoping to get a kiss.

## Free?
Hey, I spent all my money on those caramels.

## You grew up around here?
Not far from here, South Boston.

## How was that?
Pretty boring, I guess.

## Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?
Yeah.

## How many?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

## What, five?
I have twelve big brothers.

## Do you know all their names?
Course I do, they're my brothers.

## Do you keep in touch with them?
All the time. We all live in Southie. I live with three of them now.

## Where have you been?
If you bring the caramels.

## Didn't your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse n the mouth?
I'm supposed to understand this.

## You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you?
No.

## Why do we always stay here?
Cause it's nicer than my place.

## What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them?
They don't come over here that much.

## Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?
All right, all right. We'll go.

## When?
Sometime. I don't know. Next week.

## What if I said I wouldn't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends?
I'd say... It's only four in the mornin', they're prob'ly up.

## How's it goin'?
Fine.

## Want me to take a look?
No.

## You're rich. What do you have to worry about?
Instead you're going to bust your ass for five years so you can be broke? SKYLAR No, so I can be a doctor.

## Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry?
Some, a little.

## Just for fun?
I guess so.

## Like me?
Yeah. Someone like you who divides his time, fairly evenly, between the batting cages and bars.

## Do you play the piano?

## Yeah, but how do you know?
I don't know. I just feel it.

## And you're sure about that?
Yeah, I'm sure.

## I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with you.
Why not?

You* find out, I can't.

## Anything like work aroun' here?
Can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him.

## That cut you got?
Crate fell on me.

## Say, ain't you young Tom Joad--ol' Tom's boy?
Yeah. On my way home now.

## Have a little snort?
Course I'll say grace if somebody sets out the food-- --but my heart ain't in it. Nice drinkin' liquor.

## Been out travelin' around?
Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.

## No, I never. What?
I been in the penitentiary for four years.

## And you ain't ashamed?
He had a knife in me. That's why they only gave me seven years. Got out in four--parole.

## No, but I aim to before sundown. Gettin' kind of excited about it, too. Which way you going?
It don't matter. Ever since I lost the sperit it looks like I just as soon go one way as the other. I'll go your way.

## Is it fur?
Just around that next bend.

## They never wrote you nothing?
No. They wasn't people to write.

## This used to be mine. I give it to Grampa when I went away. You reckon they could be dead?
I never heard nothin' about it.

## This is Muley Graves. You remember the preacher, don't you?
I ain't no preacher anymore.

## What you figger to do?
It's hard to say. Stay here till mornin' an' then go on over to Uncle John's, I reckon. After that I don't know.

## Think she'll hold?
If she does it'll be a miracle outa Scripture.

## How about us? Is that the truth for us?
I don't know.

## Hide in the willows. If it's awright to come back I'll give you four high whistles.
He seen you, Tom! You wanta be fingerprinted? You wanta get sent back for breakin' parole?

## Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy?
Thought you was in jail.

## I don't expeck we can las' much longer-- some a the folks ain't et for two days. You goin' back tonight?
I aim to.

## Can't tell if you hear it or not. You hear it, Tom?
I hear it. I think they's some guys comin' this way, lots of 'em. We better get outa here.

## You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey?
But we can still do it, honey.

## Want to work, do you?
Sure do.

## What's the matter? What's happened?
Little trouble up ahead, but you'll get through. Just follow the line.

## But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?
Used* to be your land. B'longs to the comp'ny now.

## Goin' far?
Just a few miles. I'd a walked her if my dogs wasn't pooped out.

## Lookin' for a job?
Yeah.

## You know what I mean. You been givin' me a goin' over ever since I got in. Whyn't you go on and ask me where I been?
I don't stick my nose in nobody's business.

## Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all. See that road up ahead?
Yeah.

## What you mean?
Crossin' the desert in a jalopy like this.

## You been acrost?
Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.

## Workin'. Pickin' peaches. But I seen a bunch a fellas yellin' when we come in, so I come out to see what's goin' on. What's it all about?
This here's a strike.

## Fi' cents! They pain' you fi' cents?
Sure. We made a buck since midday.

## I could break up some bresh if you want me, ma'am.
What's he fixin' to do, ma?

## You want to get ast to eat, hunh?
Yes, ma'am.

## Didn' you have no breakfast?
No, ma'am. They ain't no work hereabouts. Pa's in tryin' to sell some stuff to get gas so's we can get along.

## Didn' none of these have no breakfast?
What you mean you ain't goin'? We *got* to go. We got no place to stay.

## What's the matter, Grampa?
Ain't nothin' the matter. I just ain't a-goin', that's all.

## S all right, Grampa. You just kind a tar'd, that's all. Somebody fix a pallet.
How 'bout Granma?

## Where you going?
California.

## How long you plan to be in Arizona?
No longer'n we can get acrost her.

## Got any plants?
No plants.

## Thought I'd take a walk. Any law against it?
Well, you just turn around and walk the other way.

## Not tonight you can't. Want to walk back?--or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back?
I'll walk back.

## Ma... all this, will it hurt the baby?
Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.

## Don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in California like we think?
Maybe Connie went to get some books to study up with. He's gonna be a radio expert, ya know. Maybe he figgered to suprise us.

## We gonna live here?
Why, sure. It won't be so bad once we get her washed out.

## Anybody ask anything?
No'm.

## I know, honey, an' just as soon as we get settled Al's gonna set out an' look for him. How 'bout gas, Tommy?
Ma... Ma, I--I can't go to the dance. I jus' can't Ma. I can't hardly stan' it, with Connie not here--an' me this way.

## An' you won't let nobody touch me?
No--an' look what I got for you.

## How come I got to shh? Run out, didn't he?
It sure is hell jus' tryin' to get enough to eat.

## Know where we're a-goin'?
Don't matter. Just got to go--an' keep a-goin', till we get plenty a distance away from here.

## Thank God. Oh thank God. Tommy, you didn't *bust* out, didya? You ain't got to hide, have you?
No, Ma. I'm paroled. I got my papers.

## Mad, Ma?
Sometimes they do.

## Didn' you get no sleep?
No.

## Was Granma bad?
Granma's dead.

## When?
Since before they stopped us las' night.

## She shore don't look prosperous. Want to go somewheres else?
On a gallon a gas? Let's set up the tent. Maybe I can fix us up some stew.

## What's that--detour?
No. That's all. You made a dollar, an' that's a dollar's worth.

## Busted my cheek but I can still see. What'd you hear?
Looks like you done it.

## They know what--this fella looks like?
They know he got hit in the face.

## What is it?
Don't know--but it's better'n this.

## Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
You know what I been thinkin' about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it.

## Then what, Tom?
I don't understan' it, Tom.

## Good-by, Tom. Later--when it's blowed over--you'll come back? You'll try to fin' us?
Sure. Good-by.

## Yeah?
Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread, ma'am.

## Would you--could you see your way to cuttin' off ten cents worth?
You can have this for ten cents.

## Which ones?
There, them stripy ones.

## Muley! Where's my folks, Muley?
They gone.

## I know that! But *where* they gone?
But what's happened? How come they got to get off? We been here fifty years--same place.

## Well?
They come. They come and pushed me off.

## Won't they come out here?
I don't think so. One come out here once an' I clipped him from behin' with a fence stake. They ain't bothered since.

## You mean get off my own land?
Now don't go blaming me. It ain't *my* fault.

## Who's the Shawnee Land and Cattle Comp'ny?
It ain't nobody. It's a company.

## Why, she wasn't no more'n a kid when I went up.
Then who *do* we shoot?

## Easy. After all, they ain't but about *twelve* of us, is they?
Either we got to tie him up and *throw* him on the truck, or somepin. He can't stay here.

## Not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground.
Can't tie him. Either we'll hurt him or he'll git so mad he'll hurt his self. Reckon we could git him *drunk*?

## Casy, won't you say a few words?
Got that desert yet. Gotta take her tonight. Take her in the daytime fella says she'll cut your gizzard out.

## How's Granma since we got her in the tent?
She's jus' wore out, that's all.

## Think I'll walk out an' try to fin' out what all that fuss outside the gate was. Anybody wanta come with me?
No. I'm jus' gonna set awhile an' then go to bed.

## We gonna stay, ain't we?
You're tootin' we're gonna stay.

## Good wages, eh! Pickin' oranges an' peaches?
Heh'o Tom. This is Connie, my husband.

## Man bones?
Some, I guess, but mos'ly cow bones.

## Come on. Ain't nobody gonna say anything.
Whatsa matter?

## Lissen. You done busted it. You hear? But lissen here. I won't tell nobody, y'understan'?
Please don't.

## Morning.
What's this?

## You people looking for work?
Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.

## Can you pick peaches?
We can pick anything.

## You sure you got ever'thing ready?
Ain't gonna be no trouble.

## Oh... really?
Yeah...

## What do you do?
I sell biscuits to the Southland.

## So, what are you doing now?
Whatever I can get away with.

## What?
I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.

## I sell BMW's. What do you do?
Not much, actually. My software company just went public so I'm just... hanging out, really.

## Sure. Listen. Why don't you join us up in the grandstands?
Bob...

## What?
It's me. Martin Blank.

## Really...? So what?
Okay. See you later.

## Fine, Bob. How are you?
Never better.

## What do you want to do?
I want to be an actor.

## So you eat-- read it everyday?
1 Yes.

## And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?
1 Correct. That's for you. Keep it.

## Ten years, I think. What I miss?
Here is now there. There is here.

## That's it?
Not much else.

## What's your business?
I'm a professional killer.

## Professional killer. Do you get dental with that?
Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back.

## --Torn down in the name of convenience--
Where have I been?

## No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
That's part of it.

## Watched television?
Bad television.

## What's that?
It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.

## Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
Yes.

## Are you there?
Yes.

## Hello...?
This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.

## Do you want to get a drink first?
I think they'll probably have booze there.

## We haven't seen each other since high school.
What?

## It's just a game...! Alright. Candied Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth?
Wow. I have to give this some thought.

## Like heroin?
Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.

## Like love?
Could be. The physical substance of love.

## Not the other way around...?
No.

## Is it something you've done?
It's something I do...

## You're a government spook?
Jesus Christ!

## Will you come with me?
I'm staying here.

## What if I come back?
I'll hide.

## It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do I have in common with those people? Or with anyone?
You went to school with these people.

## Shouldn't you be taking notes?
Tell me about your vision of the reunion.

## How do you know?
I just know.

## You know where I live?
We're both professionals, Oatman.

## So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around?
Yes.

## And how have you been feeling about your... work lately?
Anyway, that never use to happen. I was always the prodigy. Now I'm just one of the guys.

## What stuff?
Morality.

## Out Loud?
...I am at home with the me. I am rooted in me, who is on this adventure.

## How was your day, today, sir?
Effective. But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work.

## Do you like the people you work with?
I work alone.

## You look like you're far away. Far away and thinking about other things. I'm right about that, aren't I?
No.

## What do you want?
I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.

## Like a union?
Like a club. Work less, make more.

## Is that right?
Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole.

## ...How about I sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece?
Okay.

## Not bad. You?
Hello, Bob.

## Have you seen Debi Newberry?
Nope.

## Lisbon?
In Portugal, yes.

## Here's the news, He hasn't been in Portugal since '90. I know that from the file. Why don't you read the file, man?
In fact, I think I talked with him, in Bonn.

## Well?
I don't think so.

## Did you see Blank in there?
No...

## This?
Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.

## It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.

## All of it?
And not show it to me. Ever again.

## Would you describe their position as inflexible?
Intractable, sir. You leave tonight.

## Good. What else? Anything interesting?
Mmm, not really. But you're gonna love this one.

## Enough?
Never enough.

## What's it look like?
It's fine.

## Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
What's a revival tent?

## I have a headache. You have a headache?
No, I don't have one.

## We had a good laugh, didn't we?
Yeah. I guess we did.

## And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?
I have always thought about her and missed her.

## Paul?
You're leaving me hanging here...

## So what happened to you?
Fair enough.

## Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?
No. You drove us here.

## Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?
No.

## Ten years. What happened!?
I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I'm a professional killer.

## He sells BMW's?
He sold me this bad boy.

## How could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class bully?
He gave me a great deal.

## What the hell happened to you?
I was catching up with Bob Destephano.

## So when are you authorized to use deadly force?
To shoot you. Correct.

## How did you get this job?
Well, they were hiring, and it was only a two week course...

## How's that?
I visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been seeing in Newsweek.

## So what are you doing with your life now, son?
I'm a professional killer.

## Were you thinking of personally driving me back East?
Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's...

## You mean you hauled him all the way out here? Just like that?
Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.

## I uh... ha, ha... I don't think I ever met a lady quite like yourself and I appreciate all the pains you've gone through to --
Uh, no. I was gonna take a look now.

## Grace?... Grace, you want to come with us, take a look at Pilgrim?
When I work with a horse, it's no good just me doing it. It doesn't work that way. The owner needs to be involved too.

## Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?
That's up to Pilgrim.

## So how was your first and last day of branding?
Don't be so sure it's my last. There are a few people back home I'd like to put under a red hot iron.

## You ever just stand still for a minute?
That's your cue to say you're not laughing at me.

## Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.

## You lived in Chicago?
When I was first married.

## You were married to a woman in Chicago?
Well, I, uh... you didn't...

## Just who's been laughing at who here?
I've decided it's impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat.

## A jogger, huh?
I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.

## You sleeping all right in that house?
I don't sleep all right anywhere. But the house is fine.

## I thought you were an editor, not a reporter?
I have a way with animals.

## Are you shy, Mr. Booker?
Just polite. Well, maybe you'd like to try riding again, some time before you go home.

## He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you.
Need a lift?

## Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
No, ma'am, I'm afraid that's extra.

## Feel good?
Yeah.

## You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?
OK.

## How long did you live here with your wife?
Five years. My son was born here.

## Why didn't it work out?
She was never really happy here. She did the best she could.

## Ever think of moving there full time?
We did at one point. When we thought we'd have more children. And we after tried. We tried everything, but... wasn't meant to be.

## Everything under control?
Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.

## Huh?
Show me again.

## How thoughtful of you. And what if I decide not to go?
I don't know any other way, Annie.

## Then what have we been doing? I mean what was the point?
The point was to love each other.

## Why don't you go lie down?
I don't want to lie down. I've been lying down enough.

## Dad'll pick you up today, all right?
Okay.

## Oh, honey... What happened?
Doesn't matter. I... I don't want to come back, that's all.

## Is that your version of a pep talk?
I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India.

## What about him?
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...

## Yeah?
Maybe they should put me down too.

## I don't care.
What?

## IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY!?
Whatever you want.

## Would you like to see that?
I don't care.

## That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this.
How long is this going to go on?

## Did he tell you that?
No, you just act like you do.

## You buckled up? You cold?
Little.

## There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
I didn't see it.

## Did you ask him to come visit?
You already did.

## You got everything you need?
If I had everything I need, I wouldn't be going to physical therapy.

## Why? There's no food in the house?
No. I just thought... forget it.

## Does anybody out there want something to drink?
I'll take care of it.

## What are you talking about?
I said... I started.

## Started what?
My period.

## When? Tonight?
I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.

## Who's going to want me now?
What?... Oh baby...

## Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?
Sure.

## What's the matter, honey? Gonna miss Pilgrim?
Tom's gone.

## How's everything?
Good.

## Who's there?
Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you.

## Did you speak to Farlow?
Yes. We're suing.

## If this magazine is so important to you Annie, why are you in Montana?
Uh, yes... Sure, David.

## So, what, uh, what train are you taking?
I should be in by two.

## Sure... What's Grace up to?
Riding with Judith.

## What about Grace?
Nothing new. He's just going off duty.

## ... And uh... Mario called about moving the wisteria?
Oh. Right. I'll call him.

## Doing what?
Helping all the time! Running to her every time she trips or falls... Anticipating her all the time.

## Did you get a hold of that horse guy?
Yeah.

## What did he say?
No.

## What was I saying?
About us going someplace warm... Someplace Grace'll have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses...

## NO! What are you -- you're serious about this?
I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way...

## You've already made arrangements!?
No. I was just researching. Calm down.

## What... Bo-... What about the magazine?
She will if you think she should.

## So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all?
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.

## When are you coming home?
You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.

## Huh-huh. You?
Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her.

## About what?
Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.

## How are you feeling about work?
Let's not talk about that now.

## Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
Probably first thing in the morning. It's too late to start now. I'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark.

## Yeah, what?
Take your time.

## What do you mean?
I don't understa-

## What do you mean?
Tubab means white man.

## Was the trip okay?
Mmm. I made good time. Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow.

## Where to?
I don't know. Let's just go and... we'll see...

## Well, did you ever think about hiring a business manager?
We have a business manager. The best around.

## I'll have another round of that spaghetti if may?
Absolutely. I made enough for an army.

## What choice!!?
Either fight the way things are or accept it.

## Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture?
Pasture? Oh, that stretch of field near the hill? Yeah.

## Mrs. MacLean -- why don't you and daughter stay for dinner?
Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose.

## Where does this go, Diane?
Oh, you can just set up on the dining table. I have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow.

## I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?
Thank you. You're all doing too much.

## I was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the Pyramids. Were you ever in Egypt?
I was there for that shot, actually.

## What was it like?
I'd love to go there one time...

## You and Frank ever take a vacation?
Soon. We're going to Branson, Missouri to see my cousin Emma married. Frank loves in there.

## Must be nice for you to take a few days off from your work, huh?
Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.

## They fired you?
No, it's more like a leave of- Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, they fired me.

## You don't seem to upset?
Guess you don't have to figure it out until you go home.

## Did you always know this was the life you wanted?
Frank's a good man.

## What?
I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.

## Promise?
Promise.

## Annie, it's Liz. How's Grace?
Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control.

## Problem is, there aren't many volunteers. He's already had enough to sink a battleship. You have a pin, just in case?
Of course not.

## I believe women from New York eat mixed salads. Ain't that right, Tom?
They're already all settled in, Frank. Anyway, I'm sure Annie wants her privacy.

## It's got doors, Diane. Private as can be. Tom?
Play that sweet one you know. The one makes my wife here so friendly.

## I have some brownies left over. Want one?
No thanks.

## Can we take a look at Bronty's foal when we're done here, Dad?
Sure. As long as she don't mind.

## When you figure on branding?
Weekend after next...

## Tom?
Yeah.

## Don't you go to school?
Twice a month they give you a day off to work on the ranch.

## Have you talked to Tom about it?
Of course I have.

## You wouldn't want to dance with me, would you?
I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.

## She gonna be long?
Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.

## What does she do?
She's an editor.

## Isn't it like, obvious?
Not to me. Either you want to or you don't.

## That's not a question, is it?
You're catching on.

## Can you drive?
Drive? I'm not old enough yet.

## Where did you get Pilgrim from?
We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.

## Getting old. Not being of much use, I guess. What went on out there, Grace? With Pilgrim?
I know where he goes.

## Sure?
Sure.

## What does that mean?
I want to watch.

## So?
We already did the river. Let's go down and across the old bridge. We can circle back.

## Jude, you okay?
I'm okay... I'm okay.

## Have you heard from Judith's parents?
No, not yet.

## OK, OK.
How's Pilgrim doing?

## Do you want something else, honey? We order something else?
No, I'm just not that hungry.

## You want to watch some television?
Maybe... look -- just...

## What, sweetheart?
I want to see Pilgrim.

## Did you notice -- no cane?
I know. Amazing.

## Shouldn't we have invited Tom over?
I did. He said he had work to do until late.

## How much longer do you think?
Well, like I told your wife, it's really up to Pilgrim.

## Is the poverty worse, now, you think?
I haven't been back in over twenty years, but I wouldn't be surprised. The population's larger.

## Fit? You want to check my teeth. Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner?
If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.

## How long were you married?
Long enough.

## Does a horse miss a saddle?
Sometimes.

## About horses? I'd love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders?
Well... Dale... you know, a lot of this stuff... it just... nuts and bolts.

## What do you mean?
Now that's cool.

## Cool?
Yeah, cool.

## How's it going, Ray?
Devil book. The Unix Bible.

## What's that?
Dragon book. Compiler design.

## Oh yeah? What's that?
Right.

## What?
Check this out. It's a memo about how they're gonna deal with those oil spills that happened on the fourteenth.

## Uh... Nikon, can I... can I crash at your place tonight?
Again? Yeah sure.

## Meet Cereal Killer. As in Froot Loops? But he does know things.
Yo, everyone check this out. Hey, what's the Da Vinci virus?

## Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The big iron?
Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.

## Difficulty rating?
Cereal.

## Yeah?
Go fix the phones.

## Who's that?
Curtis.

## And what's he do?
That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks slick all day.

## Yeah? Display?
Dead.

## Dead?
Yeah. Like Rigor Mortis, Habeas Corpus.

## What are you doing?
I'm taking over a TV network.

## Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet?
Mm-hmm.

## Can this wait until both my eyes are open, please?
Hmmm.

## What did we learn in school today?
Revenge.

## Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?
No. No one special.

## Okay, I gotta get back to work. I'm gonna be home late. And would you try and please fill these out?
Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass.

## I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies?
Nah. I don't play well with others.

## I'm fine. Oh, and Dade, try to stay out of trouble, okay?
Blow me.

## Hey, don't worry, kid. If she's innocent, she'll be fine. Your mommy's safe now, okay?
Game's over. Last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence. You're not good enough to beat me, you little shit.

## Never heard of you. Done anything?
Two days.

## My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?
No, you're not in my class.

## Think you can do better?
I'll give it a shot.

## What the hell is going on?
I'm Crash Override.

## What the hell are you doing?
It's cool, I'm just looking.

## Yeah?
It has a killer refresh rate.

## Yeah.
You sure this sweet machine's not going to waste?

## Are you challenging me?
Name your stakes.

## Your slave?
You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.

## And if I win?
Make it my first born.

## Do my ears deceive me?
I'm sorry, I can't.

## What?
This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.

## You what?
I didn't know what was on it.

## Why did he come to you?
I'll hack the Gibson.

## Alright, so what have we got?
Well, we have fifty passwords, plus whatever Polaroid head here got inside Ellingson.

## Ready?
Yeah.

## Are you crazy? What are you doing?
I'm trying to help you.

## What?
Thanks for your help.

## Wanna go for a swim?
I can't believe they decided you won.

## Dreams?
Security, uh Norm, Norm speaking.

## Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management techniques. Could you, uh, read me the number on the modem?
Uhhhmm...

## Did you find the program for the virus on any of the discs we confiscated?
No. He's either very smart or very stupid.

## Hello?
We caught 'em.

## It's replicating, eating up memory. What do I do?
A rabbit replicates till it overloads a file, then it spreads like cancer.

## Colonel who?
The System Command Processor, it's the brain.

## Mr. Belford?
My name is the Plague.

## As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?
Never fear. I is here.

## What? whatwhatwhat?
I need a handle, man. I don't have an identity until I have a handle.

## Alright. How about the Master of Disaster, huh?
You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.

## Yo, what's up?
Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute, listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file from...

## What is he doing in here?
Relax, Burn, he's my guest.

## Hello?
Hey, it's me.

## Yeah! You better figure out what's on that disc, cause we're being framed. It's in that place where I put that thing that time?
Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.

## Virus?
Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.

## Excuse me?
The little boat flipped over. A virus planted in the Gibson computer system claimed responsibility.

## What the hell was that all about?
I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.

## What?
I don't want to go to jail for this.

## But you've created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker kid?
Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.

## Murphy kid turn you down?
I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.

## Pervert! What are you talking about?
The FBI computer holds files on twenty million Americans. I just hacked into it.

## So?
So, we get the mother, we get the boy.

## They had a large chunk of the garbage file? How much do they know?
Not everything. But enough to implicate us.

## What is it? What's wrong?
Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.

## What number please?
555-4202.

## Purpose of visit?
A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove.

## Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
Real charmer.

## Rachel! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to pick you up?
Jamie needs a Halloween costume.

## Okay sure. What about?
Its about tonight.

## What?
My parents baby-sitter canceled.

## So?
So I have to watch Jamie tonight.

## When did you find this out?
My parents are going to come home early tonight.

## So?
I don't know Brady.

## Are you two okay?
We've been better.

## What's going on?
Michael Myers.

## Who's that?
10 years ago? Halloween? He's Jamie's uncle.

## Its metal, god dammit its metal.
You think she stands a chance?

## What does that mean?
Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.

## An accident?
Yes, sir.

## Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
Mom, I'm on a diet. You want an oinker for a daughter?

## Can't you find somebody else?
You guys always look great.

## Clean one in the laundry room next to your blue slacks. Hello?
Honey, this tie has a spot on it, I can't wear this today. I got a 10,30 with Chuck.

## Susan broke her ankle last night at the ice rink Rachel?
Honey, I don't think their home.

## How do you know their not?
Because the lights are all out.

## About what?
You know damn well about what. You let them take it out of here.

## How many people in the bus?
Four plus Myers.

## Now where are you going?
Haddonfield. It's a four hour drive. You can reach me through the local police. If you didn't find him in four hours, I'm sure I will.

## Ready to go. Who signs for him?
I do.

## Who you calling?
Police station. I ain't closing down with out a good goddamn reason.

## What the hell did this?
Looks to me like your out of business. Now I want some answers.

## Like the last time? How many people killed back then? How many kids?
Al here lost his boy 10 years back.

## Do you love me Rachel?
Oh, serious questions tonight. Of course I love you.

## Like a sister?
Jamie, sometimes it's...

## Like a real sister?
We're not real sisters Jamie, but that doesn't mean I love you any less.

## Double scoops?
Double scoops. Now lets get some breakfast.

## You ready for some Ice Cream?
I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.

## The Discount Mart. Can we get Ice Cream after?
You bet.

## What?
He's coming to get me Rachel.

## Rachel, can I go get my costume on?
Yeah, hurry up.

## No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night?
Forget it kido. We're home by eight o'clock.

## Can we go home soon Rachel?
Real soon, Jamie. Now shh.

## I'm gonna lower you to the chimney, okay Jamie?
Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.

## Oh no you can't. I've just been there. That's the first place he'll look for you. Where's the school house? Where is the school house?
We'll hear sirens soon.

## Then we'll be safe?
Yeah.

## You don't believe that do you?
No.

## Dad, what's going on?
Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows.

## Why?
Just do it.

## I didn't know you and Brady had anything okay?
You knew. You just didn't care.

## Don't you mean what you do best?
Wise up to what men want Rachel, or Brady won't be the last man you lose to another woman.

## You remember Lindsay don't you?
Hi Jamie.

## I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
I don't want to look pushy.

## Jamie?
Call me.

## Where are you going?
The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go.

## Do you?
Maybe nobody knows how to stop him, but I've got to try.

## You look sharp. You understand?
No problem, Sheriff.

## You got your riot gun?
Yeah in the trunk of my squad.

## What are we doing?
Making sure that no one can get in here.

## Isn't this all a little paranoid?
If you'd seen that police station you wouldn't even ask.

## Now I pad locked the back door, this is the only way in and out of this house. You got that?
Got it Ben.

## Hey. I got a town full of beer bellies running around in the dark with shotguns. Who's gonna be next? Somebody's wife? Somebody's kid?
I am. Ben Meeker.

## Loomis. Folks around here aren't likely to forget your face. At least not cops. So what brings you back here after 10 years?
Michael Myers has escaped from Ridgemont. He's here in Haddonfield.

## Why?
10 years ago he tried to kill Laurie Strode, and now he wants her daughter.

## Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd?
Where ever she is, that little girl is in mortal danger.

## All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
When he makes that call.

## Something?
He's been here.

## How do you know?
This is starting to spook me.

## Is that him? Is that him?
Yes.

## What is he? Tell me! What the hell are we dealing with?
Evil.

## Where's that Deputy?
Be here in a minute.

## How's it powered?
It's over.

## Loomis. Haddonfield.
How far are you going, Mr. Sayer?

## Car trouble?
Sort of.

## What are you hunting, Mr. Sayer?
Apocalypse, end of the world, Armageddon. Its always got a face and a name.

## Sheriff, what is going on out there?
All right Rachel, you stay by this radio. The state boys will send word once their in route. When that word comes you go tell deputy Logan.

## Now you understand?
Uh huh.

## Hi, Annie, Laurie...
Calm down. Calm down. Are you all right? Are you all right?

## What happened?
Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.

## The only things missing were some Halloween masks, rope, a set of knives. What does that sound like to you?
You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie.

## He shouts, too.
Huh?

## Why didn't you wait for me?
We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.

## Well, are we still on for tonight?
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.

## What time?
I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my stupid brother trick-or- treating.

## Saving the treats for Bob?
Fun-ny. See you.

## Look.
Exploring uncharted territory?

## Look where?
Behind that bush there.

## Annie, was that you?
Of course.

## I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
I thought it was an obscene phone call.

## You still spooked?
I wasn't spooked.

## What's the pumpkin for?
I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.

## What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?
I'd say you must have the wrong number.

## Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?
I don't know.

## And I can't keep you interested?
That's great. Now you'll be too drunk to...

## Want a beer?
Yeah.

## Is that all you say?
Yeah.

## YEAH?
My parents won't be back till ten.

## We're all alone, aren't we?
Michael's around someplace...

## Will you call me tomorrow?
Yeah, sure.

## Promise?
Yeah.

## Anybody live here?
Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.

## What do we do?
Sure...

## Exactly what do you need?
Three blocks down. Get in the car and go up that other street and then back down here. I'm going up the block.

## Hi, Laurie, what's up?
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.

## Is Annie around?
No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.

## Are you coming over tonight?
Same time, same place.

## Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
Sure.

## Can we watch the monster movies?
Sure.

## Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?
Sure. Sure.

## Why are they under there?
Mom doesn't like me to have them.

## Laurie, what's the Boogey Man?
Laurie...

## What about the Jack-O-Lantern?
After the movie.

## What about the rest of my comic books?
After the Jack-O-Lantern.

## What about the bogyman?
There is no such thing.

## Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
No...

## We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?
Right.

## Promise?
I promise.

## Can we make the Jack-O-Lantern now?
Tommy, stop it! You're scaring Lindsey.

## Tommy, I want you to go back upstairs...
Who is it?

## Now I want you to change your clothes, Tommy. We're going to take a walk outside.
What is it, Laurie?

## Are you sure?
Yes.

## How?
I killed him...

## Everybody has a good time tonight. Okay, kids, what do you want to do now?
Let's make more popcorn.

## Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?
Yes, she is.

## Will you get her for me?
She's washing her clothes.

## Well, go tell her it's me, okay?
Okay.

## What did you use before?
Thorazin.

## Are there any special instructions?
Just try to understand what we're dealing with here. Don't underestimate it.

## Ever done anything like this before?
Only minimum security.

## What does that mean?
He asked me if I could help him find his purple lawnmower.

## He's the--He looks like Ichabod Crane?
I love that. That's my type.

## Are you really interested?
Oh, yeah.

## Yeah.
Uh, who gets dropped first?

## And then, uh, April...huh?
Great.

## Oh, is that what it is?
It's really terrible.

## If...well, if we took the, if we took Fifth, then-then-then we'd get to your house first, yeah?
Well, sometimes, some, uh...

## What?
Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera. I didn't know what to say.

## And you, you-you're going?
But I'm seeing him.

## Look, it's just an evening at the opera. Did I, I-I do wrong in accepting?
Oh, that was a wonderful show. I think that's the best show you two ever wrote.

## Hmm?
Do you remember that summer in France? Hannah, you had jet lag for six straight weeks.

## Only a few. A few. Do you like 'em?
I can't resist.

## Really? How flattering! Did you try the shrimp puffs?
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers. Something's wrong.

## Really? Is the food that bad?
Oh no. Not at all.

## What makes you think we're more interesting?
We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and I cried...

## Oh, what, what do you do?
I'm an architect.

## What time do you get off?
Yeah.

## Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?
Fast.

## Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?
Yes.

## So what's the, uh, problem this time?
No, I-I've been perfectly healthy. You know me.

## Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears?
What I'd like to do, is to make an appointment for you at the hospital. I'd like to have them run some tests.

## The hospital? What kind of tests?
Now, don't get alarmed. These are just more sophisticated audiometry tests than I can run here. I mean, it's, it's nothing.

## It's nothing. Will you trust me?
Dusty's just bought a huge house in Southampton and he's in the process of decorating it.

## How ya doin', man?
I told him about your work, and he's very excited.

## What a weirdo that guy is! Paranoid. What's the matter with you?
Look I-I-I'll be okay. I'll be okay.

## Yeah?
I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid.

## Well, are...are they big?
Yeah. Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.

## You-- Standards and Practices?
Ed Smythe, yes.

## Okay. Why, all of a sudden, is the sketch dirty?
Child molestation is a touchy subject...

## Like, uh...?
I don't know exactly.

## What are you doing here?
Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.

## You're out looking here?
Yes, I do.

## Where are you headed?
Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting. ELLIOT Oh, my goodness. Well, why do you still go to those? You never tough alcohol.

## I think to myself what problems could she possibly have?
Don't let me get started on my childhood. Oh, you know what? There is a bookstore.

## Yes?
Yeah, you would.

## What book did you want to buy? ELLIOT What? Book?
Oh, book? Oh, no, I... I'm killing time. I...I-I just, uh, w-want to browse, uh...

## You seem tense. Is everything all right? You feel okay?
No! No...

## Yes?
Yes.

## Yeah. How are you?
I'm...all right.

## Bye.
How-how's Frederick?

## How's everything?
Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend.

## Oh, you-you have that one?
Yeah.

## Isn't that beautiful?
I know this. Bach. F Minor Concerto. It's one of my favorites.

## Uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings?
Yes, he's just adorable.

## Did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve?
Yes, it made me cry it was so beautiful...so romantic.

## I, I must apologize. I-I'm, I-I'm sorry. I'm so mixed up.
Did you ever read this one--?

## Well, how do you expect me to react to such a thing?
Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am in love with you.

## What do you expect me to say?
Hannah and I are in the last stages.

## Why?
Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.

## But not over me?
Tch, no! We were, we were both going in different directions.

## W-well, please be candid. I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
But-but, but how about you? Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?

## Yes! But I...I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right?
O-o-o-okay, Lee. Okay, okay. You, you, y-you've said enough. It's my responsibility now. I will work things out.

## You really do have those thoughts, don't you?
Oh, all the time.

## Is something wrong?
Oh, not here. There are too many people around.

## And you're in love overnight?
Have you tried these? These are wonderful. Holly and her friend made them.

## Aren't they great?
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.

## Let's go have dinner, shall we?
Mmm.

## Where're you going?
I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk. I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.

## Are you in a bad mood?
I don't know. Um...I'm just antsy.

## Was I?
Yes, you were. A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.

## Why not?
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.

## Why do you say that? Is there something wrong?
I don't know.

## Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
Well, tell me. Should I be worried?

## But what do, what do you-- what's that mean? W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get?
Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that. When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.

## Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
I didn't say that.

## Are you in love with someone else?
My God! Wha-what is this? The Gestapo? No.

## Well, what? What, wh-what are you not telling me?
What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes? I-I-I am disenchanted. I am in love with someone else.

## Well, what is it then? What? Eh, what's come between us? How have I alienated you?
Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back? Do you? You must. They- they seem to know so much about us.

## ...just for a second. So, now I got that out of my system and I can go back to the thing that makes me happiest.
Well, what do you do? Do-do-do you talk to Holly, or Lee, or what? Do you, do you, do you phone them?

## Hi. How's she doing?
I am glad to see you.

## Hi, Mom. How you doing? Here, let me get you some coffee. That's enough of that. What triggered it?
We were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good-looking salesman...

## How can we be happy?
Well, because I never thought of God in my life. Now I'm giving it serious thought.

## But Catholicism? Why not your own people?
I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try.

## That thought doesn't terrify you?
Who thinks about such nonsense? Now I'm alive. When I'm dead, I'll be dead.

## I don't understand. Aren't you frightened?
No, thank you.

## How about something to eat?
No, nothing.

## Are you sure?
Absolutely.

## Mmm, what am I gonna do with you?
God! And why didn't you come tonight? We all had a terrific time. I really think you would have enjoyed yourself.

## Isn't it enough that I can love you?
Mmm...

## Hmm?
...you're such a puzzle. So sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else.

## Me?
Yeah.

## Oh! Are we going to have this conversation again?
Yes, we're going to have this conversation again. I...I have to leave. I have to move out.

## I don't know. I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
Why?

## Tch, oh. I always told you you would leave me. But...does it have to be now?
Yeah.

## Look at this guy.
In-in-in-instead of the child molestation sketch, why don't we repeat the Cardinal Spellman Ronald Reagan homosexual dance number?

## N-n-no, not that.
Yeah?

## But not you.
Hello?

## Well, he has to rule out certain things.
Oh, God! Do you hear a buzzing? Is there a buzzing?

## No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy.
Like what?! What?

## Do you realize what a thread we're all hanging by?
Mickey, you're off the hook. You should be celebrating.

## You're just realizing this now?
Well, I don't realize it now, I know it all the time, but, but I managed to stick it in the back of my mind...

## Can I tell you something? Can I tell you a secret?
Yes, please.

## Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something. Or go to a whorehouse! No?
I can't stay on this show. I gotta get some answers. Otherwise I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic.

## Aah... Hey, have you tried Holly and her friend's shrimp puffs?
I think they're fantastic.

## Doesn't she look pretty?
I bumped into your...

## Oh, yeah?
He was, he's just as crazy as ever. He was on his way to get a blood test.

## Hi. Where's Holly?
Hi. She's auditioning for a television commercial. She said she's gonna be a little late.

## Oh, yeah? How's she doing?
I hope you tell her it was your idea...

## Why?
...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.

## So how are you?
Oh, me, I'm okay.

## Do you miss Frederick?
I'm okay.

## Really?
Yeah. I-I don't know what's wrong with him. He's just...kind of distant and difficult.

## Like what?
I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...

## What's the matter? What's the matter with you? You look pale. You okay?
I'm-I'm okay. Yeah, I-I-I, you know, I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden. I'm-I'm...I have a headache.

## Yeah?
I think we need to eat.

## How is everything?
Everything's good. Everything's fine.

## Let me get a little reaction here. How's Elliot?
He's fine.

## Yeah?
Oh, you know what? I'm trying to convince him to produce a play.

## Gee.
The few times that I've met him... Isn't that a great mitt?

## Is there no chance?
You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.

## What, by a st-stranger?
Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.

## Fro--? You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
I want to experience childbirth.

## Get outta here. Could I speak to you privately?
Oh, sure.

## Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
This is the last time, I promise. And I'm keeping strict accounts.

## I know. H-how much do you need?
Two thousand dollars.

## You admit that we're great cooks, right?
Yeah.

## Will you just tell me one thing?
Okay.

## Are we talking about cocaine again?
I swear. I swear. We've already got some requests to do a few dinner parties.

## Ohh?
Uh-oh.

## Doesn't she look great in that new dress?
Yeah.

## Don't you think she does?
She really does, though.

## Oh!
When does Frederick ever come with her?

## Well, how about this?
Well, I, I really like that. I think that's a pretty color on you.

## Oh?
...he's really paid his dues, but...then she helped put him through architecture school, you know, so...

## Well, I think he was dying to open up. It's so sad. Now...what should I wear to my audition?
I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical. Of course, I'll never get it.

## Really?
Well, I mean, why not? You know, wh-what have I got to lose? Uh...

## Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well?
No! No, I, eh, it's just that they sing.

## W-why? You don't think it's realistic?
Yeah.

## ...every, eh, single rejection as- as-as a...a confirmation that you have no talent, or something?
Yeah. Well, maybe I'll get it.

## Awwww...
What? You don't, don't be so sensitive. Can't I say anything?

## They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
So what's new?

## Oh, what do they know?
Oh, gosh.

## Well, I don't know. We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting?
Yeah, that's clerical.

## How?
You never have any faith in my plans. You always undercut my enthusiasm.

## What's the matter with you, Lee? Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?
Look. Listen. Listen. You want to write? Write.

## What's the matter?
Write! Let's just not talk about it anymore.

## Hey, what's the matter?
I'm real upset about what you wrote.

## My script?
It's obviously based on Elliot and me.

## Can I, can I not accept gestures and feelings from people? Do I, do I put people off?
Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.

## Well, why don't you share them with us?
I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.

## Don't, no, please. Will you-- No, don't...
Oh, why are you making those faces?

## You want some?
Come on, Mickey. Come on.

## My--uh...
Can we, can we go?

## I love songs about extraterrestrial life, don't you?
Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.

## Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.

## Yes, you do recall, right?
I recall you.

## Good. How are you?
I'm fine.

## Yeah?
It was a terrible evening.

## You look wonderful. You do. What happened to you?
People change...you know.

## So how are you?
I'm okay.

## You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
Oh, nothing much. You know...

## Yeah? Is that an embarrassing question? Should I have not asked it?
Probably not.

## Are you, are you out of work or something?
No, well...I've been trying to write.

## Have you?
Yeah.

## Well, that's interesting. Wh-what kind of stuff?
Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.

## Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, \"Hey, I have something I just wrote,\" right?
Nobody ever said it.

## This is it. Yeah. This is really-- HOLLY Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it? Something...that I wrote?
Oh, I'm fine.

## What...what about your script? So what's it about?
Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.

## Really?
So, uh...I threw it out, but I have this other one.

## Come over tomorrow and read it to me?
You must be joking. I've been doing all my own reading since I was forty...you know.

## Well, what about me?
Oh, well.

## Really?
Oh, it just came to me one day.

## Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but...

## Well... I'll tell you. One day about a month ago...
Oh, who cares?

## Oh, yeah? What?
Oh, don't be silly! No! Don't be ridiculous.

## Do you? I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?
Yeah.

## Hi. How you doin'?
Okay.

## When'd you get here?
Just a few minutes ago.

## Mmm, what?
I'm pregnant.

## At least she isn't drinking. Did you notice?
Mm-hm.

## Where are the antihistamines?
Dad...

## April?
Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe.

## Yeah, okay, right. Forget it. What's to eat?
Boy...Holly...Holly.

## Why are you so upset?
You know, you've been picking on her ever since she came in here. Now just leave her alone for a while! I'm just suffocating.

## What makes you interested in becoming a Hare Krishna?
Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.

## Yeah, well, what's your religion?
Take our literature...

## Tell me about your trip... what did you bring me...?
I can't think.

## A reward for what?
Some museum director disappeared.

## And?
They're offering...

## What?
You've gone off to America, on your Vacation...

## Yes? My promotion...?
I want to talk to you about your salary. Because I can't...

## Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
I hereby acknowledge that...

## Then why did you chose to inform me of it...?
To show...

## Oh yeah? Wanna arm wrestle...?
If you'll come down the street I will make you a cup of coffee.

## ...what hindered you...?
It wasn't my day.

## ...how are things at the Hospital?
It's a growth business.

## What have they got you doing?
Orderly.

## He told me, he preferred to Eat the Rude. Or, \"natural composting.\" Do you think he'd come after you...?
We got a bunch of materials.

## Yes?
And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase.

## Why me?
...very good.

## ...why?
Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...

## Now, whyn't you help us?
That would adversely impact my income.

## Then who's buying it?
There's one or two freaks, and, for a \"Pass,\" I'll rat them out to you...

## You want me to be?
I'd prefer it... But it's just a vacant exercise.

## ...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?
...they did it for a lark.

## Who are these guys...?
Rich, comic book freaks.

## And why is it a vacant exercise?
Because we both know who's buying the Lechteriana.

## And have you found Peace..?
Bad beat today.

## Hey, I'm fine. Whaddizit, you, how's your day, our gallant International Neighbors...?
Evelda Drumgo.

## You want to get married...?
You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready....

## You want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
That's right.

## What's new onna street?
All Quiet Along the Potomac...

## Are you alright...?
I almost shot the baby...

## Who called the TV CREWS...?
Who, can you think, who would want to harm Dr. Fanelli, did he have any enemies, that...

## How was America?
Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.

## What's up...?
Doctore Carlo Fanelli, curator of the Pallazo Capponi, 2 months missing.

## Yeah, so where is he?
Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.

## They got that kind of money?
Their family owns...

## What else did I miss...?
Atrocious Torture. Hit of the Season, you want, I know a guy can get you a ticket.

## ...are they hard to get?
Impossible.

## You spend the afternoon in Bed?
First things first.

## You take this much time over everything?
That's why my wife adores me.

## Can we identify it as Dr. Lechter?
Not with any certainty we...

## Why did he come back?
Our operatives in Brazil have been empowered to offer a reward of....

## ...are you alright, sir...?
HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM. Where have we Seen it Before.

## Seen what, sir..?
Do it...

## Waal, Nobody's Perfect... What do we hear from our songbird in Switzerland?
If you would see him monument, look around you.

## What do you want me to do?
Follow Starling, stake out Starling. Increase the pressure on Starling. He will come to her.

## You give me whatever I want...?
Yes. You know I will. That's right.

## The children...?
...they're from Baltimore....

## What would that be?
He... would consider it a favor if he could make a donation. To a charitable institution of your choice.

## Now, why in the world would he do that?
I... think... he was.... he was touched, by your reaction. To his appearance.

## What reaction?
Exactly.

## Do you know the seller?
We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.

## He is...?
He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison.

## And how would you know that?
Before \"The Change,\" Mr. Verger was... he made quite a study.

## I believe that your tone implied that there was some good...
...young boys, still...?

## Oh, yes, what? You'd bribe me, to, to, to, \"release\" you...?
..suitcase...locker...

## ....what...?
...fraid, that's about it, Doctor.

## Why?
For a consideration.

## Starling...?
One moment, and they're at the Seven-. They botched the fallback plan, they...

## ...what's he got against you?
A fellow with five fingers.

## Am I on that case, sir...?
No.

## ...she couldn't act on her own..? Where is the FBI's vaunted Initiative, where..?
I think that's... Starling, I'm sure these gentlemen...

## And how did she get close enough to disarm you?
She threw a punch at a man on the team.

## What is that supposed to mean...?
I think its meaning is clear.

## You nervous...?
Evone tells me, I shoulda been in, fi, six, months ago.... thizz my first checkup.

## Said what?
I'm an orphan.

## What'd you say, hon...?
I said sometime it gets so...

## You want to hold him...?
Waal...

## And how do we account for the interest of such a charming man, an interest in Torture?
My husband brought it to me from America.

## You know it?
I have had many excellent meals there.

## ...how so?
...you told me you were studying for your examination by the Studiolo...

## And what was the trip before...?
That, that was business...

## Could you tell me, did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?
I never met him. I knew him only from his writings.

## You have taken over his offices, is that not so?
It is only temporary, until my confirmation by...

## Why did you look at me that way?
I saw a man in disheveled clothing, but clean. Just dressed--in the middle of the...

## You assemble this, on the instant, from these few observations?
I'm a historian. It is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.

## ...your scar..?
My scar is a war-wound.

## How so?
Carpal-tunnel syndrome. From a life of typing. Commendatore. History, a hazardous profession.

## Yes. How did you know?
You resemble a figure from the Della Robia Rondels, in your family's chapel at Santa Croce.

## It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John the Baptist. You have seen the chapel?
I have had the honor.

## And? Then?
I wonder no longer. You were out of the country.

## You know America?
Darling, Dr. Fell. My wife Madame Pazzi.

## Who does not?
If such there breathe, I'm sure you could unearth him... Your reputation does you honor.

## Take mine. Ah. And is that your wife... Signora. Can it be that you are lovelier, even, than at our last encounter...?
...long overdue.

## Yes, I think I amused them. To what do I owe...?
I require...

## Where do you live?
With Mama and Shirley and Stringbean.

## In and out. Yes. And Mama... and Mama, is not your real Mama, is she Franklin?
She my foster.

## She's not the first foster that you've had. Is she?
No.

## Do you like it at your home, Franklin?
We got KittyKat...

## ...who say...?
Make them eat the figurine.

## Is it necessary to know?
Well, I don't want to starve them too long. They die.

## I realize, you're under a lot of....
And, fine, alright, and fine... what are youdoing, this whole time?

## You put my friend in the ground, with your mickeymouse TaskForce... Izsat the kind of Headlines that Preserve and Promote, you, sir?
...may be the heat....

## Perhaps...?
Spoken like a Protestant.

## ...I'm sorry....?
...we were speaking of my father...

## And how did he do that?
He saw the truth, and spoke it...

## ARE YOU DONE?
Yes.

## Would that add to your mirth?
Explain in depth the plan we have for him. Until tomorrow.

## ...might I make a suggestion...?
...after you' re dead. AND WHEN I GIVE THE WORD, do you understand...when I give the word...

## You want another drink, honey...?
I want the same... but I already drunk it, so, barring that, yes, I would like another.

## What's that, Baby?
Alcohol. Where both its life-enhancing And its life destroying qualities... ...not unlike some Hindu God...

## That's what I should do. Tell me why?
Because, baby, you're looking to find love in an institution, that's your only chance....

## Yeah, but who would marry friendless me... Howabout you, Romeo...?
...not to turn around.

## You're going to do that?
I'm going to do it, and you're going to catch the bouquet.

## No. I want to buy a dog.
Mr. Crawford asked my opinion. Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery. Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?

## What broke you free, Girl?
I met a man, and His Troubles Were Greater Than Mine...

## ...what?
Do you think you could make a cup of coffee, cause I'm going to work.

## ...what...?
N'not that sad.

## You goin to shoot yourself?
Don't shoot yourself.

## Cause I'm tired, cleaning up after you. Why dontcha gimme the gun?
Give me your gun...

## ...what...?
...the purpose of the exercise... is it because they are expensive...

## ...why are we here in the first place...?
Because it is exclusive... because everyone will be here...

## Because...?
Because we cannot pay...

## PHONE ...what did you want?
I know where he is.

## PHONE And why should we believe you?
I know something no one knows. He has had his finger removed. On his left hand. It left a scar.

## PHONE What shape is the scar?
I want the money.

## PHONE What shape is the scar?
The shape of a Three.

## ...this one is my favorite. It has not title. They should call it \"fetch,\" whaddaya think...?
I know it well.

## Do you. What does that mean?
It is a gravestone in the cemetery of ______ in my native Florence.

## What're they on about?
They're grilling the applicant for the Vacant Post.

## And what does that mean?
...I feel that...

## Tell me why...?
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be impolite. Because, you know, you can't understand.

## ...and to have done...?
....that's right.

## ..and humiliation? What is this new job they've...?
No. That's right. That's all part of it.

## Then, that being so, why is today special? Why have you come back to see me? Is it that new file they gave you?
I don't think so.

## I don't know. Do you know...?
Yes. I think I do, to your mind, your most private fears.

## What does that mean?
I saw a man today, a man so hideously deformed who'll spend his life in a hospital bbb...

## ...would you use a small word?
Yes, but no one is in control of their emotions. that's all we have time for today...

## That if decision here. Why are you here...?
I..

## ...yes...?
I want to do something positive...

## ...why?
Because it's the game you've chosen. That's really all we have time for.

## ...yes...?
But. He was a night watchman? His hat an his badge. Clear as day, bulletholes and all.

## But they were not there. Yesterday. Is that called a Delusion...?
For the worst hurt, of course, that which will not heal, is the conviction no one cares.

## No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?
Because we must leave the past in the past. Ah. And here we have artifacts of, yes, my own encounter with him...

## Because?
Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.

## And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
Because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived. And because you have large resources.

## ...sir...?
Yes, then, you're saying that you haven't bid upon these drawings.

## And this Peepers was your...dog? If it makes you feel better, I probably wasn't paying attention.
Why are you...don't stop...why?

## That doesn't make me feel better! Why are you being like this?
Stop it, stop it, you satanic whore!

## Did you wait until you were 18?
I'll bet you're glad I waited until the last day to have this conversation.

## Now what? What did I do this time?
I just wanted to know if you've seen this.

## Was there a night that I got really drunk and declared that I never loved anyone as much as I loved you?
No.

## I'm in the picture on Wendy's wall. Niagara Falls. Family trip. Little Wendy foreground. Me background. What are the odds on that one?
Uh, yeah, that's...wow.

## Eavesdropping, eh? Hear anything good?
Man, it's not like I don't know about women. I had this babysitter...

## Wha-at? What is it?
Ooh, I'll think of something, missy. A telescope? Where you going? I don't want to know.

## No, they're not from Wendy.
Thanks, Talia...Why are you so nice to me?

## Your Secret admirer?
Not so secret anymore. Don't look all at once...behind the pine...Dorothy from Cabin Seven.

## Yeah, an insane female gynecologist! Hayley, don't listen to her.
Hello?! What's in it for me?

## What are you doing?
Nothing.

## Why do you even like me?
You remind me of me when I was...I guess I was never like you. So cute. So questioning.

## Yeah. And?
It's just funny...who needs a serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw when we have ourselves.

## \"...how important our friendship...\" Not that old--Oh God, what have I done?
I-unno...Don't worry, I had everything on the hand memorized.

## Hey--that coffee? You're a goddess. Gimme, gimme...So what you gals talk about?
Oh you know, Bosnia, the importance of the right to vote...

## Do you really not believe in God?
It's okay, there's a lot of things I don't believe in...

## What else don't you believe in?
Talking while kissing.

## When were you in Niagara Falls?
About ten years a--why...Don't look at these...Come on...Stop.

## Are you allowed to do it more than once a night?
It's been known to happen.

## Do you really think I care?
She got a little poison oak and started screaming for assisted suicide.

## Hey, you're not settling for the two shots are you? Knock me out girl. It's the only way.
What do you want me to say?

## It's not my style, okay?
Nice guys finish last. I should know.

## So, are you a cheerleader?
No, not at all. BRAD You're pretty enough to be one.

## Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
Hey, don't run away now.

## What are you talking about? She hated you! You hated her! What are you smiling at?
I don't know. This thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

## Like last night, Veronica?
I'm sorry? I don't get it.

## So what was the first week of Spring Vacation withdrawl like?
I don't know, it was okay, I guess.

## So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?
I don't know, it was okay, I guess.

## Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I smoke these damn things?
Because you're an idiot.

## Something like that. Will you do it?
Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd.

## I just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't get treated badly here do you?
I don't get treated at all, but hey, don't worry about it. I'll do your thing. It'll give my Mom a smile.

## Ouch....the lunchtime poll. So what's the question?
Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......

## I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?
Fuck me gently with a chainsaw. Do I look like Mother Theresa? If I did, I probably wouldn't mind talking to the Geek Squad.

## Doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna?
Like I give a shit. They all want me, as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior.

## Yeah, and who wants that on their teeth?
You wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school. If I wasn't already the head of it, I'd want the same thing.

## I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.

## Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've been set up with? Witty and urbane pre-lawyer or albino accountant?
Don't worry. David says he's very so he's very.

## Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please?
No. Hell no.

## Veronica. And Jesse James. Quelle surprise. Hear about Veronica's affection for regurgitation?
We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night.

## Did we? How the hell'd you get in here?
Is this turnout weak or what? I had at least seventy more people at my funeral.

## So tonight's the night. Are you two excited?
I'm giving Veronica her shot. Her first Remington Party. Blow it tonight girl and it's keggers with kids all next year.

## What do you want from me?
Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader but...

## Very very. The photographs?
Don't worry. I'll ask you to do me a favor. You'll get the negatives and everything back then.

## Guess who?
Heather.

## Is she dead?
I said I was sorry.

## It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
No.

## Yeah, I just got back.
Jealous much?

## What are you doing?
Heather, my love, there's a new sheriff in town.

## God, aren't they fed yet? Do they even have Thanksgiving in Africa?
Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater tots; it's a real party continent.

## Yeah, where's your urge to purge?
That was seriously warped, Veronica.

## Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?
Ram asked me out, but he wants to double with Kurt and Kurt doesn't have a date.

## What were you trying to do? Sleep?
Suicide is a private thing.

## If everyone jumped off a bridge, young lady, would you?
Probably....

## If you inherit five million dollars the same day aliens tell the earth they're blowing us up in two days, what would you do?
That's the stupidest question I've ever heard.

## You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?
No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.

## The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee?
I didn't. Cherry.

## Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place.
Just a humble perk from my Dad's Construction company or should I say Deconstruction company?

## Everybody's life's got static. Is your life perfect?
Sure, I'm on my way to a party at Remington University.

## I saw the croquet set-up in the back. Up for a match?
That was my first game of Strip Croquet, you know. I thank you.

## O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?
Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue.

## Like a suicide thing?
Adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion.

## She missed \"myriad\" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?
That only proves my point more. The word is a badge for her failures at school.

## What is this shit?
I'm doing a favor for Heather. A double date. I tried to tell you at the funeral but you rode off.

## Do you take German?
French.

## Did you miss him completely?
Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on....

## We killed them, didn't we?
Of course.

## Sure. Can we make an ice run before the funeral?
Your son's dead and you love him.

## Can't you see this is a special moment?
I was just making it more special.

## Our sins? What sins? If you put a Nazi in a concentration camp, does that make you a Nazi?
Maybe.

## Catch a movie? Miniature Golf?
I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.

## This knife is filthy.
It's over, J.D. Over!

## What in the hell do you think I'm doing? Taking out her tonsils?
I think I know Heather a bit better than you, okay? If she was going to slash her wrists, the knife would be absolutely spotless.

## How do you turn the fucker off?
You really fucked me up, Veronica.

## Who does that new kid think he is with that coat? Bo Diddley?
Veronica is into his act. No doubt.

## I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh?
I guess.

## Any contestants worth mentioning?
Maybe. There's kind of a dark horse now in the running.

## Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender?
Maybe.

## How was the funeral?
Superb.

## I'm lost. You don't get enough attention, you get too much attention. Which is it? Where are your shoes?
All we want is to be treated like human beings, not like guinea pigs to be experimented on and not like bunny rabbits to be patronized.

## Where is he? Where's J.D.?
We have to talk. Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.

## People just don't take the name Heather seriously. They should, shouldn't they?
I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering.

## We're pretty handy with model making, too, eh?
playfully shoves his hand away.

## Thought I'd have a go at building the birdhouse on Saturday ... anyone want to give me a hand?
Yvonne hasn't been herself, either. Locking herself away in her room ... endlessly writing.

## Is it hurting, dear?
is chopping firewood in the back garden. HONORA approaches him.

## What now?
She says Juliet's in a terrible state ...

## Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
Juliet's infectious ... she'll be going to hospital.

## Can I go now?
grabs Pauline by the shoulders.

## What does old Stew want?
She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.

## stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand.
These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?

## What?
Well ... no. But it's so obvious.

## You mean travel by ourselves?
Stay still or they'll be blurry ...

## It's a three-act story with a tragic end.
Do you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws?

## Your mother is a rather miserable woman ... isn't she?
Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...

## What's happening to me? What are you doing?
You came in for your EEG. You fell asleep and well, I took the liberty of...I'm sorry. You looked like a wreck Trevor.

## Well? What do you say Trevor? Que pasa?
Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...

## Allison? Why can't remember what happened to my wife? Is it something I'm on that's... that's making me forget?
Easy there Trevor. You need to relax.

## Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.

## Well Trevor? What have you got to say for yourself? Que pasa?
Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you've got me on.

## So, I'm done. Thats it for today?
All finished.

## Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.

## Second most common?
Skin cancer.

## I understand, I think. Other women?
You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.

## No. She just would have loved it up here... Allison when I was under... did I ever talk?
Sure plenty of times.

## Well?
Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming. So practically everything say is going to sound strange.

## Did I ever talk about the accident?
No.

## What was it?
Allison I think I did some very, very bad things. I mean very bad.

## Trevor what is the metric probability of you getting any work done at all today?
Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a split coconut.

## Look never mind. Just get some numbers going- any numbers at all will due. The hills have eyes remember?
Must be nice.

## What?
Getting paid for doing shit.

## Gwen.
Yeah, how's that?

## GWEN?
I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.

## You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
Serious as a heart attack my friend. I think she literally fucked me brains out.

## What's the occasion?
I quit. Today's my last day.

## How much time off?
As much as he feels like. Its a much more pleasurable line of work.

## Yeah? You and who else?
Someone special.

## Bret... what the fuck...?
Tonight was supposed to be the night, Trevor. Remember? I couldn't believe you went through five dart games and didn't even joke about it.

## Bret. What the hell is going on?
Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.

## Have we met?
I've been in here before.

## Who's Allison?
Allison Dormere. Your intern.

## No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
What did you just say?

## What's the difference?
Last time anybody saw this woman she was alive. You seem to certain she's dead.

## What's that?
Sorry I just kind of... spaced for a second there.

## And it shows. Least it did last night at the quarry. In a big way.
What's wrong, Trev?

## YOU'RE giving ME a speeding ticket? Mr. Mario Andretti himself?
Gwen, my wife's dead.

## Oh I see. That again. Trevor? I realize it must be hard. But Christ how long does it take someone to move on?
That was cold...

## What?
Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.

## Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now Kirsty?
Shut up and play darling. Your turn.

## Uh... eighty two?
Eighty four.

## I'm... I'm doing a very special thing here. And you can't even ... respond?
Just concentrate on the task at hand please. Listen to me. You should be giving ME this lecture.

## You've been cheating on me haven't you?
Yes I had a quickie with the neighbor during your last contraction.

## Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt work for one second.
What?

## What?
Never to put you in my will.

## And besides, I thought, to hell with it... it's okay if you only married me for my money.
Really? Why?

## Really, why's that?
I only married you for your body.

## Kirsty... Kirsty?
It's okay it was just a nightmare that's all.

## Yes. Now go back to sleep. You're driving the rest of the way to gramma's remember?
It's perfect.

## Where's my wife?
Okay then. Here's the scoop.

## What evidence?
It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.

## Sorry I'm in your seat aren't I?
No please make yourself at home.

## Where is she? Where is my wife?
Sorry to take up your time like that Trevor. Don't work too hard. Oh, before I forget. I talked your neighbor out of pressing charges.

## What?
Thanks.

## Morgue...?
Look Larry I know you never thought too much of me. And I know this all sounds a little fucked up.

## Do you know where you are?
Ambulance.

## Okay how many fingers am I holding up?
Two.

## You mean... when the car went off the bridge?
Wow you are out of it.

## How is our little student doing? Has he learned his lesson yet?
I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...

## What's under that sheet...?
You probably don't remember the night we played. Your first year as husband and wife.

## What things do you think you've done?
But I saw these women. I saw their mutilated bodies. I saw their ghosts. I just know it happened I can feel it...

## Are you ready?
I surrender...

## What do you mean?
Last week...

## The car accident? Any of this ringing a bell?
It's not that kind of date.

## Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
You.

## You okay?
I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually.

## I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?
God. Sometimes you can be such an animal. Other times you are the ultimate tease...

## Wow. That's good. Lots of capers, huh?
If you ever smelled this coming from our dorm room, you knew one of us was in there getting laid.

## Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What do you want?
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...

## You got a drinking problem or what?
I sell them at the recycling center. Gives me a little for gas and food.

## One leg! Like the Red Cross or something?
I know a guy who only has one leg.

## They interview you or anything? At the plane crash?
Hey, do I look crazy? I don't go for that shit... interviews, media. They're manipulators. \"Keep a low profile,\" that's my motto.

## The bathroom! For two days?
Jail! Listen, Bubber... This is crazy. We could fall off of here.

## And she thinks you're blackmailing me?
Right.

## I'm not saying I hate sick people or anything but I hate being around. I probably woulda vomited on him.
Huh? Whadda you mean?

## Allen? He... he's okay?
You got those people out of the plane, LaPlante, not me.

## You woulda didja?
Well, I donated a lot to different causes, uh... La...

## What's going on? \"Guilty\"! What is this?
He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.

## We can hope. You still have your job, right?
Yeah, I been calling in sick. They think I got the flu.

## I understand. How often do you see your son?
Often, uh.

## How recently?
Uh, his birthday, uh, May. I think.

## \"The Angel of Flight 104!\" You're telling me you're the A...?
Twenty-five grand is peanuts! All you gotta do is get me outta here long enough to collect.

## Whaddaya mean they didn't reduce the bail? If they didn't reduce it, how'dja spring me?
I took a loan on my car and my computer.

## You whaaaaaat? You paid it? You gave a bondsman ten percent?
I was inspired by the hero, how he stuck his neck out for others, how he took a chance...

## Listen, now that I owe you twenty-five hundred bucks plus, how about loaning me twenty for cab fare?
So you can call me \"naive,\" Mister LaPlante.

## You mean John Bubber?
Nope. Legal problems, you gotta have a good attorney.

## You gotta kid? How old's your kid?
Nine. I think. Maybe ten. Yeah, ten. Nice kid.

## I can't afford no better. My ex, she attached my pay check for child support payments. You looking for Bernie LaPlante by any chance?
I didn't even know you had a kid.

## We're all assholes, Bernie?
When I was a kid, I thought I was gonna be this fantastic wonderful heroic human being.

## You don't wanna know, Chick, you don't wanna know. Those guys been in here?
You in business with those guys or what? I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.

## You mean like Bubber? The hero?
Yeah, like that. Same thing.

## I mean, if I said it, wouldja believe me? Ya wouldn't, would ya?
Nothin'.

## OUT! I TOLDJA. JESUS CHRIST, I GOT CUSTOMERS WAITING! AN' YOU WERE GONNA GO OUT LIKE THAT? AN' MEET THE PUBLIC IN STOCKING-FUCKING-FEET?
He had an emergency call... a real emergency.

## Why doncha let me in so we don't wake everybody in the neighborhood?
Willya lemme talk for Chrissake? I'm trying to tell you what happened. What happened is...

## \"Elliot\"? The heroic goddamn fireman?
Turn that thing off.

## How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante?
How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake? Hey, put that thing down. This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just...

## What's your scheme, Mister LaPlante? What are you forcing John Bubber to do? What are you -- ?
For God's sake, tell him I'm on my way. Let's go, Chucky. A police escort is gonna pick us up en route. You too, LaPlante.

## The cops! What kinda bullshit is this? Is this America or -- ?
Here! Here... ten, thirty, fifty bucks. How much have you got, Chucky? Give Mister LaPlante your money.

## My fault! My fault! This nut case goes out on a ledge and it's my fault?
If anything happens to John BUbber, Mister LaPlante I'm going to see you prosecuted to the full extent of the law.

## What, is everybody in love with this, bozo? I don't get this. What about...?
\"Harassed.\" Cause I yelled at him when he's riding in his limo? The guy's a thief, he took my...

## -- saved your... whaaaaaaat? What? Blackmailing...?
Underbelly!

## I'm going to apologize to Bubber?
I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...

## Was it you? In the plane? Who saved my life?
Me? Listen, I don't give no interviews. That was John Bubber. You wanna ask me questions, you could talk to my attorney, Miss O'Day.

## This guy, this \"friend\" your mother's seeing, he's a fireman, huh? He ever... spend the night, whatsisname?
Sometimes. His name's Elliot. He saved a guy's life one time. In a fire.

## \"The Nomm\"? What's that?
It was this war. Viet Nam. Doesn't matter.

## What picture?
Me in my uniform. Used to be on the bookcase.

## I'm working on that. It's just I got some business problems and... whatsa matter?
Here. Get off here.

## ...unworthy of the adoration. We all do.
All the adulation? It makes you feel like a fake, doesn't it?

## Is she... serious? A half a million dollars? In my behalf?
You're a celebrity, John. People are going to want to please you... or use you... or both.

## No, John, you're too hard on yourself. I've got the creep here, the guy who's...
You do?

## What're we talking about? Reach out for what?
I told them how you were upset we didn't save the guy...

## That too.
He's gotta be a nut! He saves all those people and swipes a purse?

## Would the station put me up at a good hotel...?
There's a lot of confusion around what went on last night, it's not clear...

## How'd it go?
He'll do it. You really-should have talked to him first.

## Ticket! What's going on?
She's flying to New York. She's been nominated for a Silver Mike...

## What about a reward for coming forward?
I thought they'd all go \"It's him! It's him!\" and hug the guy or something.

## Upset! What's he upset about?
Said he's not an actor.

## He's not supposed of it. Did she call him back?
She can't quit.

## It's not unthinkable.
Listen, Deak, what if Bubber has got something to hide? What if he's the wrong guy, not really the hero...?

## What?
The Presidency. The public loves him.

## You were in bed. Weren't you?
If I gave you the impression I hated him I didn't mean to. I... I hate the way he behaves... he's selfish and self-centered and cynical...

## What's \"cynical\"?
Oh my God! Bernie!

## You didn't?
I said I wished it had at least occurred to me to consider saving him.

## \"This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!\" Incredible. Unbelievable! For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now? 'Cause he stole paint?
We couldn't find his name on the buzzer or on the mailbox, but...

## Is he like that in real life? So gorgeous?
He's pretty... remarkable.

## You didn't... get it on with him?
Don't be ridiculous. I'm a reporter.

## Reporters don't have hormones?
Reporters... have to... rise above their hormones.

## What about?
I didn't ask him.

## Safety?
Look at that. You can't buy better protection than that. That there is your Man's Best Friend.

## How are they with kids?
They're great with kids. They love 'em. They eat 'em up. I'm kidding.

## So, Neil. How's it goin'?
Okay.

## I'm Bernard, by the way. Those are cool Reeboks, Neil. They're real new, aren't they?
Hey, c'mon.

## Was that your dad?
Nah, that's some guy fixing the living room floor.

## So where are all your toys?
Let's watch some TV.

## Where are these toys of yours?
A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet. Here's the TV.

## Are you being helped, sir?
I'm looking for some perfume.

## Any particular brand?
Well, it's for a woman.

## Wife, girlfriend or mother?
Oh -- uh -- girlfriend.

## How's the new place?
It's great. It's clean and airy and quiet -- there are trees and flowers. There's still some fixing up I have to do, but it's coming along.

## And the rent is okay?
Oh, it's nothing. No problem. I was really lucky to find this place.

## Yeah, things are moving along, but she's still involved with this other guy and it's a little tricky.
Yeah, since I was a kid. I had a woodwork class once when I was... in school that time. Then I learned a lot more when I was in the --

## And how are things with your lady friend, if I may call her that?
Oh, fine. She's gone away for a little while and when she comes back I've sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her.

## Who doesn't?
I've cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever.

## Oh, well, do you fix refrigerators?
Sure.

## Well, can I make an appointment?
Maybe I could take a look at it now.

## Do you do washing machines, too?
Just show me the way.

## It's a living.
Isn't that always the way?

## Do you have a family?
Uh, no -- I've never really found the time to settle down.

## I was driving by -- I saw all the cars. Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm okay -- it's been a long night.

## What happened?
Can I tell you tomorrow? I think I...

## About what?
I'm thirsty.

## A man? Was it a dream?
Uh huh.

## You know how sometimes Neil bugs you and you just get up and walk away from him?
Uh huh.

## Did Daddy tease you?
Yes, he did, and I don't like it any more than you do.

## So you don't have anything concrete?
No, I told you. A whiff of perfume on his shirt.

## Have you just plain asked him?
I've asked him what's wrong.

## And?
I could take a cab on the way home.

## Whew.
No, honey, I haven't seen him. Didn't you feed him this morning?

## The pocket's a cinch -- I'll sew it up for you after dinner, okay?
No, thanks, Mom -- I'll go up to bed now.

## Do you want me to come up and tuck you in?
That's okay, Mom.

## What's that?
This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.

## You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
They don't expect to get what they're asking. Let's make an offer.

## It's a nice pool, isn't it?
And it's a shorter commute.

## What if someone else buys it in the meantime?
We're going to think about it.

## Damn.
How were we -- were we cool?

## What?
He made, you know, a remark.

## Honey, are you okay?
-- And keep my kids away from his property -- who the hell does he think he is? Some nice neighborhood.

## How was your lunch with Charlie?
Oh -- great.

## Do you remember who gave us this?
No.

## How long does it have to be a new house?
One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.

## He's made some friends, hasn't he?
There are to get caught.

## Who told you that -- someone on the radio?
I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus.

## Did the cleaning woman come?
His secretary just confirmed.

## What -- what are you doing?
I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.

## What?
Oh, honey.

## Someone blew the whistle. Someone hates me.
Everything! It's like everybody got an anonymous poison-pen letter or some -- Do you smell smoke?

## Philip, what are you doing here?
I think it's time I came home now.

## What?
No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here. And if you want to talk to me -- call.

## Should I come home when I'm finished there?
We'll talk in the morning.

## It's been on the market a while, hasn't it?
Not very long. There have been a couple of bids already.

## Isn't it?
You'll see that there's really much more space than the average three bedroom.

## How large is your brood?
Two -- three if you count the husband.

## 1 What for, dickweed?
No.

## All right, who ate the last piece of cheesecake?
I didn't.

## Oh really? You've been going through a lot of personal crap. You, Princess Di and Madonna?
If you want that baseball jacket for your birthday, Neil, learn to cough a little more realistically.

## What did the thermometer say?
-- A man.

## Do you see a man?
No.

## Oh yeah? Where's the bed?
Right over here.

## Is it a king or a queen?
It's a double.

## Promise?
Promise.

## Would you?
Uh huh.

## Really?
Really.

## What the hell. What is this? A joke?
No joke, Lieutenant.

## Where's the guy we saw in the beginning -- what's his name...?
Parker. We found him knocked out in the can.

## If he was knocked out in the can how could be walking across the lobby?
Hey, I don't have answers for this. I just brought you down here because of the sword.

## Am I supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out?
You can believe what you want. You saw the tape.

## Lieutenant Bedsoe?
Not now. I'm busy.

## What? Who are you? What do you want?
My name is Jennifer Hillman. I'm an archaeologist. I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.

## What do you think?
They appear to be authentic.

## Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?
Well, technically it's not mid evil - - it's Renaissance.

## You didn't see this. Understand?
Yes.

## Yeah -- how'd you know that?
Hey Lieutenant, the boys in robbery have something I think you should look at.

## What is it?
A tape from the surveillance camera at the First National Bank. It was robbed this morning.

## Anything from the bank?
We sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the State computers, the FBI and interpol. Nothing.

## So?
I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain.

## What?
Cut him loose. The D.A. says you ain't got shit on this guy.

## When did you get back?
A few days ago.

## Where were you last night around nine?
I already told you. I took a walk.

## Tell me again. Where'd you go?
Central Park.

## Doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?
No. I don't scare easy.

## Where have you been for the last seven years?
Around.

## And Brenda?
She was a good woman.

## I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?
No.

## You sure?
He doesn't look familiar -- but then he'd probably be easier to identity with his head.

## Is that it?
No. I'm telling you right now, the next person's head that comes off is gonna be yours.

## Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
You'll have no need for that, Highlander.

## I know that weapon. It belonged to Juan Romeriz. He's dead?
Aye.

## You?
No. He was my brother. He died at anothers hand.

## Who are you?
Thomas Cavenaugh. I am a teacher of sorts. Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.

## What?
Sing.

## You?
Life. You've stopped living it. You look, but you do not see. You listen but, you do not hear.

## What else? What else do you hear right now?
The river.

## That's all?
Yes.

## Leaving what?
England. There is nothing for me here anymore.

## And what do you think you will find in another land?
Maybe myself.

## For what?
For being a friend when I needed one. I hope our paths cross again.

## If it came down to it what would you do?
I do not know. I pray that I shall never have to raise my sword against one that I call friend.

## The sea and I don't agree with each other. Where we off to?
France.

## Not long. We should arrive in the morning. Are you going to be alright?
Me? Of course.

## Living. Remember?
You may be living -- but this suit is killing me.

## What worries you?
You.

## You've been seeing her for over a month now. Have you learned nothing from the past?
I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.

## No. What am I to do?
The only thing you can do. You must end it.

## Well?
It's done.

## What do you think?
I think you just like to eat dirt.

## I know that for six months you've worked hard and asked for little. That you're a good and honest man. What more need I know?
This cannot be.

## Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?
I've come to strike a bargain with you. I wish to learn the power of changing.

## And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
Your life.

## How?
We had a bargain. You promised.

## Where do you go when your mind drifts?
Different places.

## The past?
Sometimes.

## Why not?
I'm leaving in the morning.

## Leaving? For how long?
You'll no see me again.

## Why?
I cannot explain.

## Do you love me, Conner?
Aye.

## Why are you doing this?
Because, it's for the best. There are somethings that are better left unexplained.

## Any idea how big the cavern is on the other side?
Huge.

## You guys are from the British museum, right?
No -- we're from Strange facts and mysteries. It's a syndicated show out of..

## Are you a cop?
No. I'm an archaeologist.

## What do you want?
To talk to you.

## Corpses?
Yes. We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland.

## Yes. How did you know?
A lucky guess.

## Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
If it's good advice.

## Where did you get it?
It's mine. It's been in my family for years. It belonged to my great, great, great grandmother.

## What's going on? Why did he call you Macleod?
Because it's my name.

## Then who's Russell Nash?
I don't know anymore.

## Why do you stare at me like that?
You remind me of someone I used to know.

## Who was that man last night?
I don't know.

## Do you always walk around with a sword?
New York is dangerous place.

## About what?
It probably wouldn't interest you. It's something I read in a mythology book.

## Have you ever heard of the Calan?
No.

## Why?
I told you I'm interested in mythology. We can talk about it more.

## Why?
I'm just trying to place you.

## How come you wanted to meet tonight?
I wanted to get to know you better.

## That makes you uncomfortable?
A little -- yes. My interest in coming here is profession.

## Is it?
Why don't you tell me.

## Have you told Lieutenant Bedsoe your theory?
No.

## Why not?
Because I don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours.

## So?
If they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall.

## Not unless they're immortal.
Yes -- if they were trying to get in -- but what if they weren't? What if they were trying to get out?

## Would you like to see it?
I've seen it.

## You?
You wanted the truth -- now you have it.

## Where will you go now?
It will end tonight.

## Must you fight him?
He will not stop until it is over.

## What now?
Now I can start to live. To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another.

## Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark.

## Why?
Someone broke into the cavern last night.

## What? How?
He's fine. He swears he never left his post for a moment. He heard a noise and when he went back to look they were already inside.

## How could they get by him?
I don't know.

## What's that next to him?
His head. Someone cut it off.

## You stayed here again last night?
I was working on the cataloging.

## Do you? Then why don't you go out? Meet someone. Make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?
I like my work.

## It's not been long enough. What witchcraft is this?
I do not know -- and even if I did...

## Why did you wait?
It will not end tonight.

## It isn't over, is it, Conner?
No.

## How can that be?
I don't know.

## Is there anything else you need?
No -- I'm fine. Thank you.

## Would you care for some water, Conner?
Aye -- that I would, lass.

## You kept it?
Yes.

## What are you doing?
I shouldn't have come back here. It was a mistake.

## Is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?
Yes -- when their troubles can harm them.

## I heard voices downstairs. Is everything alright?
Fine.

## What will you do?
There's nothing I can do. I'll wait. One way or another soon it will all be over soon.

## Good afternoon... ... Shirley.
Why?

## Would you like to deposit this in your account?
No. The money, please.

## The house belongs to Walter and Pamela Smith. They've got two kids, a girl about fifteen and a boy younger, Jennifer and Thomas.
Mike! Mike, can you hear me?

## That would be the girl who opened the door. Are the others inside?
The mother is in Florida visiting her sister. The father works at home, so he's probably inside.

## Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs. You understand me, Larry?
I guess so.

## Dead end--it's a clone. What about the Mustang?
It was stolen.

## You get anything on Smith?
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.

## Our people out there, they good people? People in the right place?
The best.

## Bullshit--a man will do anything to save his family. Who's running the show up there?
Find out how we can hurt him. By the end of the day, I want to own him.

## You think we should take that chance?
I guess not.

## What, he's cute? That's his idea of humor?
If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too. You should let them know.

## Who sent you?
Don't go Rambo and you'll tell'm about this on the back nine. I'm gonna tie you up, then we're gonna take your car.

## C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid. I thought we were gonna go to the movies.
The car. All you want is the car?

## Mars?! Whattaya think, dude? Out here on the edge, no one around, it's perfect, right?
Try to act cool, okay? He's gonna think you're a dick.

## We got jobs, man; we're working. Why even take the chance?
Everyone knows what we look like, Dennis. We won't be able to hide.

## Not if they're looking at something else.
Someone should stay with Mr. Smith. What if he wakes up?

## Like what?
If we don't escape, we gotta get the word out about the cash. That's how we'll stay alive.

## What are you talking about?
Yeah. I'm Rooney.

## We had an awful lot of shooting. You need a doctor in there?
We're cool.

## How about your two friends? You don't have a man dying in there, do you?
They're fine.

## How about the cop?
I'm here.

## What?
I gotta piss real bad.

## That you, Talley?
The one and only. We got a little problem out here, Dennis.

## You got a sniper out there, gonna shoot me?
Only if you try to grab me. We could've shot you from the wall.

## Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?
I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could.

## Maybe that's what I'm doing. Can I reach in my pocket, show you something?
You picked a bad house to hole up in, son.

## Who else is here?
My father.

## Shut up and sit down. You think someone's gonna make a house call?
They'll cut the power.

## You got something to say?
I like it here, Dennis. I'm never going to leave.

## You mean he left, as in went out the front door?
I overheard him with the girl.

## Shit! Even when I want to turn myself in he screws it up! Did he take the kids with him?
That would be Mars Krupchek. Jesus, he works for me, too.

## Is Krupchek an aggressive guy? Hot- tempered? Anything like that?
Keeps to himself, more like.

## We have to own this guy, Marion. We don't want him dead; we need to use him.
You have his address?

## Donuts here any good?
I don't eat junk food.

## Are you out of your mind?
You fucked up, Glen.

## What do you mean?
If things get wet, we're going to need someone who can handle that end.

## Goddamnit, tell me what you know. Did the cops go in? Did Smith have the disks?
I don't know. Talley talked those punks into letting Smith out. He's fucking us over, Glen. That guy is fucking us over.

## What hospital?
Canyon Country.

## How did you get this number?
I have your fucking family. Don't forget that.

## What do you want?
My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family. We'll trade.

## Fuck the mall. You know that motel on the road west of town?
Yeah.

## You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they?
They're close. Let me make a call. You can see they're okay.

## Where is it?
I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and they're giving it to the real FBI. This one's a fake.

## Can we talk some more when you get here?
The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.

## You sure?
I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.

## Want one?
I don't drink beer.

## What do you want?
We can't make the microwave work.

## What?
We're hungry. You're going to cook.

## How about dog shit?
Kevin left without you.

## You gotta pee?
I don't see why you can't just lock me in. It's not like I can go anywhere.

## Either I'm going to tie you or Mars will tie you. Which do you want?
Thanks for the shirt.

## What do you want?
Keep your voice down. I'm taking you and your brother out of here.

## What happened?
Do you want to go or not? I'm offering you a way out of here.

## How can we get out?
Yes.

## We have to cordon off the streets, then evacuate these houses.
Are civilians inside?

## What are we going to do about Mike?
Keep your head down.

## What's going on?
York Estates. Four-five-five Castle Way. Anders and Jorgenson are on the way.

## Is something wrong with Jane?
We have a boy on the line. He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.

## One at a time! Clear the air! Louise? Talk to me. What do we have?
Junior Kim was DOA at the hospital.

## Did he say if she was shooting at him?
He didn't say.

## Then we don't know if she's part of this or not. Mickey, you up?
I pulled Mickey and Dreyer off the minimart.

## Louise?
Go, Chief.

## Louise?
Go, Chief.

## You have her cell number?
She didn't answer.

## Did you find Jane and Mandy?
Could you call me back on your phone? Right away.

## What's wrong with the radio?
Other people can hear us. Just call. Please.

## I've done it once or twice. I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him.
I'm Talley. Who's in charge?

## Maddox! You got that?
Then get your men off the wall! You breach that house, we're gonna have a bloodbath! I know this guy, Captain -- I can talk to him.

## Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
No. He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.

## -- then when you get him, you damn near assault the man in the ambulance! What?
Let it go, Captain.

## Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders. You see it?
It's right in front of us.

## Are all of you named Jones?
Don't be funny, Chief. You can't afford it.

## I asked you my name. You just saw my commission slip. What's my fucking name?
Special Agent Jones.

## What are you people going to do?
You and I are gonna straighten this out with the Sheriffs, and then we'll wait for the man to call. When he gives the word, we move.

## Thomas Smith. I'm in the house that's on TV. Dennis hit my dad and now he won't wake up. You gotta help him.
What does he have on you? I know why I'm doing this, but what does he have on you?

## Slow down, Thomas. Take it easy and talk to me. Was your father shot?
Dennis hit him. His head's all big and he won't wake up. I'm really scared.

## How about you and your sister?
We're okay.

## Where are you right now?
In my room.

## That's on the second floor. Could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you?
I think so.

## I need your help with something. But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?
Okay.

## What do you want me to do?
Your dad has two computer disks. They have funny names, Marlon and Al.

## I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office. Could you find them and see who they belong to?
Dennis won't let me go to the desk. He makes me sit on the floor.

## Can you get into the office?
I can get into the den. The office is right across the hall.

## If I get Rooney into the back of the house, can you find the disks without being caught?
Yes, sir.

## Can you open them?
I opened Marlon. I think it's somebody's taxes.

## Look for names. Does it say whose taxes they are?
They're still in the house.

## Did you find the disks?
Yes.

## Where's your gun?
I'm the Chief. I don't carry it.

## Who are you?
Follow the Mustang. We won't go far.

## What do you want?
These guys are going to take hold of you. Don't freak out. It's for your own good.

## Can we let go? You past your shock and all that, we can turn you loose and you won't do something stupid?
You can let go.

## These disks ... where are they?
Smith will know.

## VOICE My people are good to go. You know who I mean?
Your phony FBI assholes.

## What do you mean by that?
VOICE You don't want another dead child on your conscience.

## Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?
I'm sorry, it's a private function.

## What happened?
They're killing everyone. The Lady Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the gate.

## We, who is we?
A delegation.

## Cockroaches?
No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.

## Excuse me?
Leave it to me.

## Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times?
Of course.

## Who are you?
I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu.

## What is this about?
Let me see your identity card.

## You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
No. I work at the Mille Collines.

## Where is your family?
They are all Tutsi cockroaches.

## How much?
Name a price.

## How many in your family?
Six.

## And four children?
I'll give you a hundred thousand francs for all of them.

## Do we know who fired the missile that killed the president?
No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.

## We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the bloodshed.?
Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.

## If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.

## Have you requested re-enforcements?
Yes we have.

## What was the response?
We're awaiting a decision, excuse me.

## Paul, you know who this is?
Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.

## Yes sir, but these people they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium?
They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians who I sent to get the lady minister.

## Where is she?
Anything. Strong.

## Canadian Club?
Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved us all.

## Their people?
They're only taking the whites.

## Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.

## What is it?
The rebels have fought their way into the city. They have many Hutu prisoners.

## I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day?
No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.

## The United Nations. Madmen are on the streets, Paul. But I will take care of you. Your cellar is well-stocked, right?
Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about.

## What did you overhear?
A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.

## What did they say?
The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.

## Satellites?
Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.

## And what will they do with these satellites?
The American said intervention is too costly, better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command.

## The high command? Our high command?
Indeed, general. Excuse me momentarily.

## If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?
The front gate would be best, General.

## I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
I am strong, Paul, like a lion.

## Where are my supplies?
I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.

## You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey?
No. We have no way of finding other stock but I have money for you from the guests.

## Whiskey?
The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you.

## Your police are at the gate?
After the Diplomat! Paul clambers in the back.

## Where are they going?
They can go where they want. They are in charge now.

## What do you mean, General?
We have decided to move the government to Gitarama.

## When?
Today.

## You know what the Scottish call it?
No.

## Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?
No, sir.

## I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now?
Pack those carefully, put them in my jeep, and guard them.

## I am on a list! What list?
When the Europeans left, their soldiers gathered lists.

## You think they will believe you?
You will tell them the truth.

## Business is good at the hotel?
Very good.

## Everything is double the price now, you do understand that?
I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.

## What do you mean George?
Their money is no good to them. Soon all the Ineysi will be dead.

## Ground rules! Where the fuck do you think you are, Wimbledon?
We cover the story from here until we can get proper protection.

## Lets go, Jock.
What is it?

## Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
Youre drunk.

## When will they be here?
Very soon.

## Gregoire, what are you doing here?
Get out of this room and get back to work.

## Where are we going, sir?
For supplies, you drive.

## Are you sure this is the river road?
I saw the sign.

## Paul, how the hell are ya'?
I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.

## They moved you from the Diplomat?
Promoted. House Manager.

## Did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat with you? You know?
I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.

## Can we phone them in, Paul?
I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish.

## This goes out live?
Give her what she wants, room, food, anything. Charge it all. Don't you put her out, Paul.

## Yes, sir. What is wrong?
Everyone must leave the hotel now.

## Why sir?
It's an order. Get everyone out now.

## Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier. What is this?
The guest list. It hasn't been updated since the murder of the president.

## Don't lie to me. What's your name?
Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.

## What do you want?
We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.

## What?
Our cards, please.

## What cards?
You have our cards.

## How much?
One thousand francs.

## Was there blood?
No blood. As I left a neighbor, an old woman, waved to me. I went to her house. She has the little girls. They are safe.

## How do you know?
Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.

## Move? Where to?
I'm going to put you on the third floor.

## Good evening, Odette, who is sick this time?
I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.

## Your brother's here?
Yes, with Fedens and the children.

## Thomas wants advice?
He wants your wisdom.

## Homework?
Do something.

## What?
Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake.

## Why didn't you call your contacts in the army?
I couldn't help.

## No, I could not. What do you know about favors Tatiana, about barter and deals?
Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor.

## Where are Thomas and Fedens?
I sent them home. Go and call them.

## Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
What is it, Paul.

## Any luck?
No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.

## Has Roger spoken yet?
No, Odette says he's in shock.

## He needs to be in a safe place. Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
Give him time.

## What about us?
We have been abandoned.

## But who is left?
I don't know. Colonel Oliver says the UN has three hundred soldiers for the whole country. Black soldiers, Pakistanis.

## What are you saying, Tatsi?
Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.

## So where is the lamb?
Maybe Gregoire and the witch ate it.

## What's the matter?
We're running out of beer and other supplies.

## Go out! Where?
To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.

## Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the roof?
It's alright. This is the only place I can find some peace.

## I hear we must pay for everything. How much for this?
A kiss.

## In Ruhengeri?
Yes, when you worked as the nurse.

## What?
I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali.

## Why?
To be closer. So that I could marry you.

## What was the bribe? What am I worth to you?
It was substantial.

## What sort of car?
What does it matter.

## A little longer, Paul?
We wait until 7,00. If he is not here with the twins he is not coming. We leave. That was your promise. Go help the children.

## What sort of plan?
Our children cannot see us die first. If the Militia comes, you must hurry up to the roof. I will meet you there.

## What's wrong?
I have to go to the Diplomat.

## Can I have your name again?
Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The house manager. I met you on your last visit.

## What's wrong?
Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.

## What is it like to fly on a plane, sir?
It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama.

## That is why they call it coach?
Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.

## You have taken business class?
Many times.

## Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire?
He has taken the presidential suite.

## What do we do with all these people?
Open up the ballroom, we'll put them there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it.

## What are you doing?
The lieutenant wants the register.

## Where has all our beer gone?
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.

## How much beer?
Many beers.

## When?
As the trucks go.

## What is this about no water?
It's true, sir, the water has been turned off.

## Paul. Are you alright?
We have a big problem. The Hutu army have come and ordered us all of us out of the hotel.

## Out? Where are you going?
I do not know, sir. I think they will kill us all.

## All. What do you mean all?
The staff, the guests.

## The staff and guests! How many?
Now we have eight hundred guests and one hundred staff. I have ten minutes left.

## Paul, are you there?
Yes, thank you Mr. President.

## Paul, if you have one call in all the world to stop this, who would you call?
The French. They supply the Rwandan army.

## Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
No, I don't want you going on the street.

## Who is this Simon?
There are soldiers.

## Where?
On the street.

## Can I help you?
I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.

## What is his room number?
I don't know.

## -- there's already been way too many complications for a very simple plan. You ever find out what happened to Melissa Marr?
Not yet.

## If you don't mind me asking... Who are you?
Name's Pritchett. Watson Pritchett. I own the house, my father built it. And now I just need to get you into it. So...

## Why in God's name wasn't this thing removed years ago?
It was on my Dad's list of \"things to do.\" But the House did him first.

## -- uh, excuse me, just one quick question? How long before this damn thing unseals itself?
Something just must've...frightened her, that's all.

## Just for the record, what are the rest of your names?
Donald W. Blackburn, M.D.

## Is she alright?
Even if I were inclined, I've had better -- and a lot safer -- opportunities to kill off a wife.

## Excuse me?
Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior wives, so we've been informed.

## Oh, really, who?
I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.

## You sure? You'll be alright by yourself?
I wanna know first, to what do I owe this honor? I mean, I never even heard of this guy.

## I lied. The House is alive and we're all gonna die.
You're totally full of shit, aren't you?

## So, what? You're saying we're stuck here the rest of our lives?
A cleaning crew's supposed to arrive at 9,30 tomorrow morning -- I think the power of the house fades at dawn.

## What's in there?
Nothing.

## Yes.
So you're saying as long as that door stays locked, we're okay?

## What's down there?
The...Fourth of July.

## What's life, anyway? Waves...? Sound...? Light...? Electricity...? I don't know... Phone lines...?
Oh. Jesus.

## What?
Hail Mary, full of grace -- the house is growing!

## Right here, Mr. Pritchett. As well as five other bona fide, bank drafts for one million dollars each. Made out to cash.
Pritchett, is that you?

## And we get this money when?
This is nuts.

## Prove it how?
Oh, Jesus....

## Is she...alright?
I thought she was dead. For sure.

## You need to get out more.
Why?

## What? Deep down inside?
Start with the name you were born with, and we'll work forward from there.

## Why not?
Hey, if everybody's gonna kill each other, could you do it in another room? I'm trying to get something accomplished here.

## What the hell good is fixing that gonna get us?
An answer, I hope, exactly what -- or who -- Melissa was taping.

## I think we should have taken a right back there.
And then where are we?

## Back where?
Good point.

## What are you looking for?
This is the best we're gonna do.

## He's dead...?
Don't think it's even an issue.

## It's succeeding!
We're safe?

## Where did it go?
Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.

## ...Jesus H. Christ.
What?

## You've got your own TV show?
The guy whose hair I do has his own TV show. All I've got is a blow-dryer and a dream.

## So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did that?
I hope not.

## How'd you make your guest list, Price, throw darts at a phone book?
Oh, I think we're going to have several.

## I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they?
I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven, Round One, you win.

## Then who are they?
You tell me. I don't know how you managed to hack into my Mac, but, bravo.

## Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn?
It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.

## So how's a girl to know if these things are loaded, baby?
Only one way I can think of, Sweetheart.

## And where are we off to, Mr. Price? Check the wiring on the animatronic Mummies?
A simple leak, if it's okay with you.

## Where is she?
Stalking the wild poltergeist.

## Well, who's the damn thing from?
Messenger just dropped it off. No return address.

## -- being utterly fucking useless, what else is new.
You didn't think to ask?

## -- well, here's a better one, you're fired.
You think this is fucking funny?

## Absolutely. No cheap thrills. A genuine Journey To The Brink Of Madness.
What?

## And then what happens?
I think it's something better experienced then described.

## You're forgetting my lovely wife; she's part of the same winner-take-all as the rest of you.
What?

## What're you talking about?
Oh, sorry. Detail I guess I forgot to mention. You die, you lose. Your check gets divvied-up by those still amongst the living.

## If you've got a gun on you, Price, I'd hand it over now.
What is it?

## Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?
Fascinated.

## Don't take your eyes off her for a second. I think she just declared War.
Then who did?

## Of course he did, for God's sake. Didn't he, Mr. Pritchett?
I can't comment until I get paid.

## What's going on?
Don't know that it does.

## Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
Hasn't been a telephone in this House in over 60 years.

## Why not?
Believe me, we need to.

## Ghosts killed your father?
Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house...

## And you think it's in there?
Accumulated evil... festering for decades... But I'm a drunk... so don't listen to me.

## You coming, or are you waiting for Blackburn?
Blackburn's dead.

## Excuse me?
He would have been back by now.

## Over here.
Pritchett, what is going on?

## I feel something. It's faint, but...it's there...
Please.....anyone....help me?

## You say you saw some activity here?
Damn it.

## What's the matter?
These records only go back to 1880. But... ...wait a minute...

## Did you find something?
It doesn't say. But that's not what interests me. There's no death certificate for the daughter. Anywhere.

## What was her name?
Colleen.

## So many unanswered questions. Why was she buried there. And who killed her?
It might have been her mother.

## What will they tell you?
I'll be able to do a search, to find out who lived here previously. And who died here.

## Thank you. If you told me two years ago we'd be living here, I would never have believed it. Do you live around here?
No, I live about in Wexford. It's about a five hour drive.

## How did you meet Dr. Shea?
I have to admit I was skeptical. Until now.

## Are you all right?
A few years older, perhaps.

## How's your arm?
It will heal.

## Where does this amulet come from?
By freeing them.

## What do these ingredients mean?
Pearl, is the twilight, the divinity... Onyx is the sickle, death...

## Can we leave out a bowl of milk, mommy?
Sure.

## Can I do it again tonight?
We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey.

## Honey, isn't your friend's name Colleen?
Yes.

## Can you talk to her?
She talks to me.

## Are we leaving mommy?
Yes, we'll be leaving soon.

## Where are we going to go, mommy?
We're going to go someplace new.

## What about all my other stuff?
We'll get it later.

## She says she's lonely...
H-how long will it take?

## Where is she?
She's here.

## Where is she now?
I want this one, daddy.

## What's he doing daddy?
He's blessing the house.

## Why?
For good luck honey.

## Did you grow up in Ireland mister?
That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did. Lived here my whole life.

## Are we going back to California daddy?
Well, that all depends.

## What's the matter?
Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while.

## What will Aubrey think?
Aubrey knows more about us than you think.

## Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
Or what she was worth.

## What?
It's not going to work. I'm too smart for you.

## What the hell is that?
I don't know. That's strange.

## Were you fooling with the power?
It was in the cellar. Weird.

## So what are you saying?
I don't know what I'm saying.

## But do you agree with me?
Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.

## Well what do you think it is?
Well, I try to keep an open mind, but...

## Who?
Just because I have an open mind doesn't mean I'm going to pay some snake oil peddler to come in and shake a voodoo stick around the house.

## What are you talking about?
She has a...friend. Colleen.

## A friend?
You, an imaginary friend. That's what she calls her.

## How are we doing?
You seem to appreciate the local scenery.

## Are you all right?
I'm ok.

## What do you mean, unfortunately?
We usually find nothing. We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.

## What about the other five percent?
Where is your daughter? She might be able to give us some information.

## Ok, so we have a...presence. What do we do about it?
If we have a troubled spirit here, we have to find out why it's troubled.

## I'm not sure, but I can check. Did the events start before or after you discovered this?
Before.

## Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?
White meat will be fine...

## May I come in?
Thank you. I believe she would have wanted it.

## Did you know her very well?
She attended the church for years. A dear woman, it was sad to see her decline so rapidly.

## The blood of a woman is birth, life. It is part of the ceremony. Seamus offers up the pin - Maura waits a beat, then takes it -
Why?

## So what should we do, father?
Go ahead. I believe right now she may hear you.

## And you...are?
My name is Father Seamus. I'm from Holy Rood church.

## What was she afraid of?
Well, I believe her mind was playing tricks on her, God rest her soul. She would hear things, see things...

## I didn't do anything...God saved her...
What...amulet?

## What's going to happen?
I wish I had an answer. Evil is powerful, more so every day it seems. But I believe the worst for you and for this house is behind us.

## And what would you do?
Well, we could bring in special equipment, monitors, sound devices, things like that.

## So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?
Not someone. Something. I've never felt a presence that strong before.

## Do you have any other physical evidence, that we can look at?
Not really. Oh, wait a minute.

## Where did you find this?
It was nailed to the cellar wall.

## Do you mind if I borrow it?
Not at all, if it can help.

## What do you mean?
I mean hardly any thigh. I'm telling you, Joey; shorter skirt, more lift on the leg-cross ... and you're made.

## Hello?
You wanted a story. You got it. Turn on the TV now. And then get your ass down here ... ...

## It's ... I don't know. First World War, right?
Correct. The fields of France. And many dead flowers ... Oh. Forgive me. My name was Spenser. Elliott Spenser. Captain.

## And what did you discover?
Something bad.

## What can we do?
I like you, Joey. You ask all the right questions. There is something we can do but it will require great courage.

## So where is it?
Your apartment.

## Wha .... ?
The Box, Joey. He wants the Box.

## What happened to him?
Hold on. Hold on, please. I need talk to you.

## Right ... So ... Well, what do you want?
I want to talk to you. We met ... now, listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at the hospital last night.

## Yeah. Sure. You mean ... tonight?
Of course tonight. Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...

## What?
Your dream. You said you were having a bad dream.

## Why are you so interested?
Sorry.

## Oh, right. Did he used to ... ?
That's great.

## Great. Thanks. You gonna have one?
I'm trying to quit.

## Oh, go on. Have one. Fuck it. You think you're going to live forever?
Sorry. It was my father's. It's temperamental.

## Wait a minute. He was already ... wounded ... when you found him?
Yeah! That's what I'm saying! And it was lying next to him. And he pointed at it before he passed out and ...

## Wait. Wait. The chains. Where did the chains come from?
That's what I'm trying to tell you! ...

## Right ... That's ... er ... that's nice of you, Terri. Can I ask? Is it always this ... exploratory?
The bank owns it. But I'm working on it.

## How have you ... ?
Guys. Sometimes friends. Mostly guys.

## Wow. Lotta books. You read all these?
No. I buy them to impress people. Of course I've read them.

## And he still sits there?
Every day.

## Maybe not. But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue?
Yeah. I found it. I knew held like it and I figured ...

## Woah. Wait a minute. Who? The kid?
No. JP. My last boyfriend? He like owns the club. You know? You were there? He bought the statue.

## Sure. Why?
It's Saturday morning. Let's go shopping.

## Buying some drugs, alright?
God knows. Anything. Contacts. Clues.

## Joey ... ?
Help me pick 'em up, Terri. I think the lady just made a sale.

## Fine. Fine. But can you tell us anything about it?
It was part of a job-lot. Some loony- bin they shut down. Unclaimed stuff.

## What else came with it? Anything still here?
Sure. Just papers, photos. Stuff nobody'd ever want.

## You gonna buy?
Uh-huh.

## A prize? For what?
You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring ...

## He's a barman. Whatever. Do you mind if I continue?
I'm sorry.

## No. Really?
Yes really.

## Do you mind me talking about your stuff?
Unh-unh.

## You shit. Who do you think you are?
I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.

## What ... What ... ?
What did you see? The same as I. Appetite sated. Desire indulged. You saw the working of the world in miniature.

## On the contrary. It has everything to do with the world. And our dreams of how it will succumb to us. You enjoyed the girl?
Yes.

## Don't flee from yourself. If you have a quality, let it define you. Cultivate it. It is you. By helping me, you will help yourse...
I understand. Their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional. What else could you do?

## What!? What are you talking about? Why should I help you?
Hey, that's what makes the world go round.

## How do we start?
It has already begun.

## Joey?
Not quite.

## Really?
Yeah really. I'm ...

## You're apologizing?
Well ... of course I have. I've thought. I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible. You really hurt me ...

## Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over? You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk. Just see how we both feel?
Oh, I don't ...

## Not now, no. I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean?
Yeah right. Look ...

## Really?
Yes! God, yes. I ... I just want to hug you. To hold you. To tell you it's alright.

## That's the first thing I did. Smooch the ground and taste the freedom. Sorry I was late. Miss anything?
Your timing, and your shoes, are impeccable... Good to see you, Alex, been having a lousy day.

## So Mr. Coffee, what went down outside the prison?
Oh, not much. Mario Brothers want me to do a job.

## Cameras?
No need. Guards' station's right there.

## Did I miss anything?
Oh, not much. Gates just had his tonsils taken out. The hard way.

## Geez, Gates was killed. Who do we send the thank you note to?
Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.

## Why try?
You re not thinking of going to...

## Alex, my man, it's time to play a little offense. Where's your tux?
You bastard. You fucked my freedom for a lousy job.

## No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of my life. What was your per-diem?
We're going in from the ground floor.

## Why not just go now?
Okay.

## Last rites, sister?
How.

## With all due respect to that great blouse, why didn't I cut out her heart?
No, your Eminence. I think he's going to steal the Codex, as early as next week.

## Sorry. Seventeen Hail Marys and five minutes outside.
That's the best kind. A wise woman once said \"Polite conversation is rarely either.\"

## Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot. Why was the guard chasing you?
Because Danger, Doc, is my middle...

## Whoa, part 2. Does it go to Times Square?
The Vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed, not explained.

## How long were you in?
Let's just say, I never saw E.T.

## What have you been doing?
The C.I. what? God, no...

## Where did you get this?
You know, the place where you gave the bad guys the Codex.... the Mayflower Museum.

## Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking with God. But you're a close second, tough guy. What is that smile?
I got my planet back.

## And then we'll arrest those greedy pigs... Is that it?
It's the site of their new museum and we're taking it over. Operation Deflower Mayflower is going full speed ahead.

## Cat got his tongue?
Actually he never told us what it was.

## Baseball, why?
Good job, not pretty, but good.

## Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know how to party or what?
Outbid by my own wench, quelle bummere.

## That New-York-Italian-Father- made-twenty-bucks-a-week-son- of-a-bitch. What was our bet? A million?
Million five, lover...

## You could host American Bandstand in here. Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?
Because I didn't want to get hurt, taterhead.

## If you're pausing for a \"thank you,\" give it up. So boss, you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means?
What a pleasant surprise. You're probably wondering...

## What job?
Yes.

## Weren't you the bartender at Jonestown?
All this trouble for a horsey. I may not know art, but I know what I like.

## So when's that Sebastian-Cabot- Buckingham-Palace-looking- Butlerhead getting here?
You've got a dilemma, tiger. I think I know what's going to help you solve it.

## Hush. My employer wants a meeting.
Except yours-yours. The goal of world domination. Well, if you put it that way, Minnie. How can I resist?

## I'm supposed to fall for that?
Shucks. Guess not.

## No. But why do you let Butterfinger keep those blood stains on his shirt?
Ah guess ole Moses knows jes about ever'thing, leastways if it concerns Hudsuckuh.

## Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?
I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way.

## ...Hello?
Oh, no, really, I --

## Well, it's done now -- what's the use of grousing about it. Forget the letter, Amy, I just had to blow off some steam...
Is that all, Mr. Barnes?

## Confused?
I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.

## Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?
Oh. Nothing, really, just... the more timid investors are no longer running for cover.

## ...You do?
You know, on farm route 17.

## What a beautiful thought.
Every year?

## Never mind about that...
What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy?

## You mean you know about this?
Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start.

## I tell ya the guy's a phony.
Worked in a watch factory?

## Phony, huh?
As a three-dollar bill.

## Sez who?
Sez me! Amy Archer. Why is he an Idea Man -- because Hudsucker says he is? What're his ideas? Why won't they let anyone interview him?...

## How long've you been down here?
Forty-eight years...

## What the heck they doin'?
You know what they're doin' now, Lou.

## Aw, buddy, I don't care about that.
...What's your pleasure, buddy?

## ...You don't?
Nah, that's all forgotten.

## ...It is?
Norville.

## Sir?
Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'.

## ...This'll only take a moment.
-- tough titty toenails!

## Sidney and I are planning a trip to Paris and points continental -- Aren't we, dear?
Well, frankly, I...

## All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
Well, I made the dean's list.

## ...'Shnook'? 'Dope'? 'Dipstick'? 'Lamebrain'?
No, sir.

## Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you with it, but -- this is embarrassing, kid -- it seems to concern you directly.
Not even behind your back?

## No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.
How's that, Sid?

## Ya get the special?
Fah from it...

## She must have been beautiful. What happened to her, Alma?
She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss.

## Doctors that are people can't cure everything.
What's this?

## What do you mean -- \"doctors that are people\"?
There are other doctors...Yes, other doctors...Better doctors...

## Where?
At the Houmfort.

## You mean Mama Rose was like Mrs. Holland?
No. She was mindless but not like Miss Jessica. But the Houngan cured her.

## Are you trying to tell me that the Houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure Mrs. Holland?
Yes, Miss Betsy. I mean that. The Houngan will speak to the rada drums and the drums will speak to Shango and Damballa.

## Alive?
No, miss. He's just as he was in the beginning -- on the front part of an enormous boat.

## But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?
If you say, miss. If you say.

## Ti-Joseph?
I really intended going out to the Fort and meeting you long before this, Miss Connell. I'm Mrs. Rand -- Wesley's mother.

## Frankly, my dear, I didn't expect anything like this from a nice level-headed girl. What are you driving at?
I heard the servants talking about someone called Mama Rose. They said she had been \"mindless\"...

## You must, Betsy. They'll have to believe you.
But how did you get here? What are you doing here?

## Does she suffer?
I don't know. I prefer to think of her as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened -- feeling nothing, knowing nothing.

## She can never be cured?
I've never heard of a cure.

## Is this disease common in the tropics?
I prepared these for you last night, Miss Connell.

## You're single?
Yes.

## Where were you trained?
At the Memorial Hospital -- here in Ottawa.

## That will mean another interview, won't it?
No, this is quite final. You see, Mr. Holland is a sugar planter. He lives in St. Sebastian Island in the West Indies.

## The West Indies?
A year's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that's not so bad, you know.

## That's rather nice, isn't it?
Yes -- on the boat.

## Is she a doctor?
No -- she just runs the place. She's everything else -- amazing woman, mother. You'll like her.

## Thank you. But who sits there?
My brother's wife.

## -- But, you're an American?
I went to school in Buffalo. Paul went to school in England.

## Mr. Holland?
Yes, the redoubtable Paul. He has the plantation, and I, as you must have noticed, have all the charm.

## Where do you think you're going?
It's my day off.

## I was just beginning to wonder. Aren't there shops, restaurants and things?
Well -- and things -- might be a better description of what you'll find. I'd better come along and show you the town.

## But don't you have to work?
By a curious coincidence, it's my day off, too.

## What in the world are you talking about? Six ounces -- ?
Higher mathematics. Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.

## How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
I'm a nurse. I always watch people when they pour something. I watched Ti-Joseph and it was exactly two ounces.

## That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he? That won't last long.
Did you hear what he sang?

## Betsy, can I talk to you a minute?
Of course, Wes.

## Does she suffer? Does she know what she is?
I don't know. I once asked Dr. Maxwell the same question. He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.

## Have the servants made you comfortable?
Yes, thank you.

## Can't I take it for you?
No, thank you. Tomorrow's time enough for you to begin work.

## I'm not sure I can make you understand. You know what this is?
A figure of St. Sebastian.

## A mental case?
I'm sorry...

## I suppose so. Yes.
You didn't find your patient so frightening in the daylight, did you?

## And charming?
I've never given it much thought.

## Why did you come in here?
I don't know. I wanted to help you. And now that I'm here, I don't know how.

## What you saw tonight -- two brothers at each other's throat and a woman driven mad by her own husband? Do you love that?
You didn't drive her mad.

## Well?
She is alive, Mr. Holland -- that's all.

## Help me? How?
I took Mrs. Holland to the Houmfort. I thought they might cure her.

## You have deliberately endangered Mrs. Holland's life. There's no telling what you may have started with this insanity. Why did you do it?
I told you.

## Because you wanted to give my wife back to me? Why should that mean anything to you?
You know why. You saw it the other night at the piano. You turned away from me.

## You want that?
Yes.

## And what happened then, Mrs. Rand?
Ah -- that's where reason took hold.

## But I assure you, Father Walters, Miss Connell had no idea of the consequences when she went there.
You admit that it is terribly dangerous. Why do you advise it?

## An accident at the mill?
No -- it's about Mrs. Holland. A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.

## What about her?
In view of all the circumstances, the commissioner has decided on a legal investigation.

## Investigation of what?
Of the nature of Mrs. Holland's illness. And, of course, the events which led up to it.

## To the asylum?
I believe there's a kinder name for it, Wesley. At St. Thomas, it's called the Institute for Mental Therapy.

## You're wrong, Wesley. The guilt is mine -- all of it.
Why?

## Are you going to lie for him, Mother?
Betsy, tell them about the Houmfort. Tell them what you saw there.

## Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a little early today?
Don't see how. I think the public's had its fill of this gangster stuff. No, trust me -- disaster pics. And air hockey.

## Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am. Say, where's the wife?
In Rhode Island with the folks. I'm a free agent tonight.

## OK, OK, the defense rests. Want another?
No thank you. We should be off.

## Why shouldn't she be?
Then again, why should she be? I mean with us, with our...

## So maybe you'll come too?
Oh not again Elena! If we've got problems, why can't you just come out and talk about them.

## What do you think?
Well, it is a neighborhood tradition.

## So early?
Rough day. Good night.

## Oh yeah. Musk, or something. You like it?
Hmm. Good night.

## Oh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce?
Um, yes.

## I do. I'm -- are you...?
I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children.

## What?
Leave it -- I'll wash it for you.

## The turkey in?
Stuffed and baking.

## So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one that was sitting on the dash.

## What's for dessert?
See for yourself.

## No advice from the experts, huh?
Don't start.

## What do you mean?
Don't be dim.

## Elena, what are you're talking about?
I'm not surprised.

## Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say?
It's a starting place.

## Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.
Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?

## Benjamin. That's supposed to explain it?
I think we're here and we don't have to stay -- we ought simply to put in an appearance and then we can head home.

## Ready to go?
We're not going anywhere.

## Ben.
Ben, I've got a ride home. Maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here?

## Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
We'll talk in the morning.

## Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
I'm fine dad.

## So how's school treating you?
All right.

## Classes?
Good.

## Grades?
Fine.

## Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this St. Peter's, it's top of the line, eh?
Yeah.

## Ah let the guy have his fun. What's the name of this girl with the Park Avenue address?
Libbets. Libbets Casey.

## Yeah?
You're boring me. I have a husband. I don't particularly feel the need for another.

## After the Thanksgiving I had, I need it. You having one?
In a bit.

## Huh?
Birth control.

## What are you talking about?
A prior engagement overcame me.

## What?
Jimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to take this. And what do you mean, Jimmy? I thought you said you and your husband --

## I'm picking up Paul at the station - want to come?
Nah.

## What you been up to?
Nothing.

## Your toes cold?
That's besides the point.

## But what?
But I -- well maybe I love her. Elena.

## What?
Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever.

## A key party?
I suppose we'll make an appearance.

## And Reverend Edwards? Did you make the list?
Let me.

## Look, Elena, the fact that we're neighbors... you know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don't you think?
Now don't make me feel as if I'm being too forward, OK? If you don't --

## Maybe you just need -- look, can you wait here a sec, I need to tidy up -- just a minute, I'll be right back. You'll wait?
Of course.

## Yeah. You?
Yes. Well, I guess we can walk from here.

## Who?
Nobody.

## Mikey Williams?
We were just riding around.

## Mom. Are you ok?
Wendy, of course. I'm sorry. You must think I'm ripe to be checked into Silver Meadows.

## I suppose. Why?
Just curious. If there's a problem, I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt.

## What sort of problems are you planning exactly?
Oh I thought I'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune. Or set the house on fire. You know.

## How'd you know?
Educated guess.

## Elena. Elena Hood, am I right?
They say you never forget.

## Forget what?
Forget how to ride a bike.

## You ask what the point is?
That's right.

## I'm afraid she's something of a gossip, isn't she?
I'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about. Take care.

## Perhaps you might find it in your heart to call me Philip?
You're here... I'm a bit surprised.

## Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?
I gotta get to English class.

## Where you going?
Flame on, asshole.

## Do what?
Sleep all day. I mean, look, it's already getting dark outside, and you're just getting up.

## What?
Aha! I could sense the vibe.

## You oughtta read this Hood, Nixon, our leader, all ye need know about the travails of life. Check out the Checkers speech stuff.
What do you mean?

## Francis. You gonna leave the seeds in there? In the binding like that?
All will be revealed, baby.

## And whence has yon virginal maiden absconded?
Like into one of the other 20 or so bathrooms they've got in this place.

## Howdy there. You, young knight. Can you check on the mead? Can you sally forth and secure us some more mead?
Everything's gonna freeze, the big freeze.

## Groovy. Young master of the revels, a treat for our hostess?
Come on Paulie, share the wealth. You copped 'em from her mom's stash anyway.

## You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.

## Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh?
Hey. I'll take this stuff.

## Would it matter? And what's that?
You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico.

## Play with the whip.
It's not packed with explosives, is it?

## The Idiot?
Maybe you should have just a half.

## I do.
My what?

## Right. Cool. So, how about we take a bath together?
Good thinking Marge.

## Who said so?
No one.

## Geometry?
Sure, anything but this English.

## Why are you so good at math but not in English?
I'm not good at math. Just geometry.

## Where you going?
Out.

## Sure. Twinkie?
I'm chewing.

## Tell Sandy? What?
I don't ever want to see you.

## See, no one's here. Maybe you want to go to the basement?
Maybe we can just watch some TV.

## Why did you -- with Sandy?
I don't know.

## Huh?
4,30 movie. When Worlds Collide.

## You get in trouble?
Maybe. Can't really tell yet.

## Watching what?
Nixon, doofus! It's incredible. He should be shot.

## How are the parental units functioning these days?
Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.

## Why don't you use the phone downstairs?
Calling an individual, Charles, in New York. Confirming a social outing for Friday night.

## Can I come?
It's a one-on-one kind of date thing.

## With who?
Her name's Libbets.

## Libbets? What kind of a name is Libbets?
Hood residence.

## And?
Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train.

## What are you doing at home on a Friday night?
I have plans.

## The ones you built?
I have to go to the bathroom.

## What are you doing?
Just thought I'd stop by.

## Are you his girlfriend?
No.

## We -- we have to go to the guest room. We can't stay in here. What if Mikey? My parents?
Don't worry about them. They're at that party, getting drunk and falling all over each other and making jokes about McGovern and stuff.

## You never tasted the stuff?
It feels warm.

## One more shot?
Okay.

## Huh?
That's the name for when you wake up and find this little pool of sticky stuff, like after a sexy dream.

## I don't know. How do I know?
I don't know either. You spin around, when you lie down.

## What's that, then?
Nice kid.

## What's the D.A. got them on?
Four unwarranted shootings, witness intimidation, and cocaine theft.

## About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
Will, you can't blame yourself.

## Typical seventeen year-old. She went to a party Friday night?
Down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in.

## Who's that?
The bartender at Darrow's. He was there Friday night.

## This murder was in the papers, right?
Yeah. All over.

## Who's playing?
The Puffins and the Hawks. We're in extra innings. The Hawks have a really good line-up this year.

## She your only sibling?
Twelve years younger.

## How much closer would you say you were?
I don't remember.

## Duggar called him?
About an hour ago. Said he was more than happy to cooperate.

## Worth pursuing?
Walter Byrd killed Kay Connell. Her things are in the house.

## What about your shoulder?
Don't worry. I'll have a cool scar.

## Where is he?
Thanks.

## We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
That's why I'm here. I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.

## What I saw?
Anything. It's important.

## What time was that?
Around twelve-thirty.

## Who was the last one to see her alive?
Randy Stetz. Her boyfriend. We've questioned him, searched his place. Didn't find anything.

## We're sure it's hers?
Has her books in it.

## What are you doing here?
I told her to come.

## What?
I beeped you over two hours ago.

## So?
This is a local writer. Kay had all his books. I think we should check it out.

## Where you signed this?
That's right.

## What happened at that signing?
She flattered me about my writing. Asked if she could visit me. To talk about my books.

## Did she?
Yes. Not that much at first. But then she became more comfortable. Started visiting me every week...

## How do you mean?
That boyfriend. Randy.

## Randy Stetz?
That's right.

## Are you sure about that?
Eight years.

## What do you want to talk about?
You know what about.

## Weston Dobbs killed an eight year-old boy and left him hanging in the basement like a piece of meat. You remember that?
You know I remember that.

## What are we thinking?
Looks like the natives are restless.

## Will?
I wish I could stick it out like you. I just, with Trish and the kids...

## Fred Duggar?
No. He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.

## What did he look like?
Will...I...

## What is it?
There's a guy down the hall. Complaining about the noise. Says he can't sleep.

## One of your cases?
Will.

## What if someone finds out?
We're under investigation now. Back in Seattle. Hap wanted to talk. As soon as we got back. Thought he could work out some kind of deal.

## Huh?
You heard me that time.

## Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?
Stuff.

## What kind of stuff?
Just stuff. I don't fucking remember.

## The other guy?
I told you I don't remember.

## What are you doing in this shit-hole town?
I was her best friend.

## Best friend?
Since grade school.

## You want me to take you somewhere?
Long as it's fun.

## You and Kay were like sisters?
That's what I said.

## Told each other everything. That why your picture's torn up in the top drawer of her bureau?
No...

## Who was Kay seeing besides Randy Stetz?
She used some stupid code name.

## The phone call. The knapsack.
What was it?

## I'm sorry?
I said you're going to get a phone call.

## Oh?
Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.

## Down at the station?
Yes down at the station.

## Did you have sex with her?
No.

## What about him?
He. Well, he...

## What the hell do you know?
Kay told me. She comes to me, you know. Tells me things. About you. About me.

## Couldn't get it up, Walter?
Yes. Like that.

## This an accident, Walter?
If you want it to be...

## Where's your back-up?
No back-up.

## But how did you come into existence?
You don't want to answer... Two vampires from the new world, come to guide us into the new era as all we love slowly rots and fades away.

## Are you the leader of tis group?
If there were a leader, I would be the one.

## What are we?
Nothing if not vampires...

## Who made us what we are?
Surely you know the one who made you...

## You mean we are not children of Satan?
No.

## And no vampire here has discourse with God or the Devil?
My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing.

## But why?
I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.

## So soon? Without any of those answers you so longed for?
You said there were none.

## We can do that?
That's what the one who made me said.

## And the vampires of the Theatre?
Like moths around the candle of the age. Decadent, useless. They can't reflect anything. But you do. You reflect its broken heart.

## Are these not the answers you came for?
Yes... My God...

## Not without Claudia. Where is she?
I can't save her.

## You didn't even warm them, did you?
No.

## What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we?
We are a pair, and that's what counts.

## What night? What do you mean?
You always give me the doll on the same night of the year.

## Is this my birthday?
Some of these are so old and tattered. You should throw them away.

## Does it?
Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.

## Is that supposed to frighten me?
You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.

## What plans?
I came to make peace with you, even if you're the father of lies. I want things to be as they were.

## Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them?
Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.

## Absinthe? You gave then absinthe?
No. Laudanum.

## How did you learn to write, Claudia?
The way I learn everything. By watching you.

## Why does he call you that?
Hush, Claudia don't talk about such things. Show me your book.

## Why not?
We're immortal. You've always known that.

## You both did it?
I took your life. He gave you another one.

## Should we burn him? Bury him? What would he have liked, Louis?
Don't mock, Claudia...

## How do I look?
Still my beautiful child.

## A beautiful child! Is that what you still think I am?
Yes...

## You want me to be your daughter forever, don't you?
Yes.

## Well tell me, papa. What was it like making love?
You don't remember? Or you never knew.

## Or her, or her - or any of them?
No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.

## Love?
You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned you.

## Yes...
You really believe that?

## And who will care for me my love, my dark angel, when you are gone?
She is dying. It happened to you too, but your child's mind can't remember.

## What do you mean?
They would have killed you -

## You want death? Is it death you want?
Yes...

## You let your overseer run riot, work your slaves to the bone. We'll start with him.
Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?

## How do you mean, start?
Call him.

## I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
I can't go through with it, I tell you.

## But why do you want me?
Because you're as strong as I was when I was alive.

## Did I hear a yes?
Yes...

## You're sure?
Sure...

## Dying?
Come, you're going to feed now.

## What have I done?
You have fed. You were made for this...

## Dear God, what have I done?
You've killed Louis. And enjoyed it.

## And if I don't?
The sun will destroy the blood I've given you. Every tissue, every vein. The fire in this lantern could do that too.

## Do you think so?
I know. It gets cold so fast.

## We can live like this? Off the blood of animals?
Of course not. It's so easy you almost feel sorry for them.

## But how do you know?
Read her thoughts.

## Paris? You came from Paris?
But you must know something about the meaning of it all, you must know where we come from, why we...

## Where do you think, my idiot friend? We're in a nice filthy cemetery. Does this make you happy? Is this fitting and proper enough?
We belong in hell.

## What, no flowery speeches? About what a monster I am? What a vulgar fiend?
I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.

## What do you imagine you are Louis?
I don't pretend to know.

## That and more.
Why do you do this Lestat?

## Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
Ah, but we have even more in common with our creator. come, I am like a mother tonight. I want a child.

## What are you saying?
You need company, Louis. More congenial than mine...

## Shhhh! Do you want to frighten our little daughter?
Claudia, Claudia, will you never learn? Who will we get now to finish your dress? A little practicality, cherie...

## Are you mad?
You'll come home with me Louis? Fro a little while... until I am myself again.

## You've come back to me, Louis? You've come again to me?
You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.

## Saw you in the street outside. You seemed interesting. Is this where you live?
It's just a room...

## So shall we begin? What do yo do?
I'm a vampire.

## See? I knew you were interesting. You mean this literally, I take it?
Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak.

## You were going to kill me? Drink my blood?
Yes but you needn't worry about that now. Things change.

## You're not lying to me, are you?
Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.

## Oh, that rumour about crosses?
You can't look at them...

## The story about stakes through the heart?
The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.

## What about coffins?
Coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity...

## Can a vampire feel love?
You loved your wife, surely.

## He did it to make you stay with him!
Shall we go on?

## But why did you tell her?
How could I not? She had to know.

## And did you lose her? Did she go?
Where would she have gone? She was a child, and beautiful, heartbreaking merciless child. And I had made her that...

## Did he die in the fire?
He was dead to us. We were free. That was all that mattered.

## No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula?
Fictions, my friend. The vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman... So we repaired to Paris...

## Dear God. I've failed again, haven't I?
No...

## You promise to care for her then?
Yes...

## And you know what you ask for?
Yes.

## What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
A child who can't die...

## And the child who did die?
My daughter...

## What can I do for you?
Checking in...Karla Wilson.

## Is that bad?
Not at all. Those are our honeymoon suites.

## Wait...Did you say off-season?
July fourth weekend. Storm season starts today. The clouds roll in like clockwork.

## What about a radio?
Sorry. Emergencies only.

## What the hell would you call this?
We haven't exchanged anything.

## Storm season?
It's our version of winter. 201 and 202. There's Scrabble and Parcheesi in the lobby. Enjoy.

## Who? Who is here?
I want off this island.

## You'll go away with you're college friends, but you won't go away with me?
Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.

## Stupid. What were you thinkng?
That could break the machine.

## You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas?
Ray, come on. I want us to be together.

## Not me...no way...
Hello? Hello?

## Think about this, Julie. What did you actually see?
The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there.

## You get any sleep at all?
Some.

## Hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...What do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress?
Nice move.

## What do you mean?
Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.

## What do we do?
I don't know...

## Julie?
I'm right here. Grab my hand.

## You're okay. Thank god.
...Nancy?

## I got in early. I was excited... Who was that guy?
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.

## Why are you being like this?
Ray, I can't...

## Can't what?
I just feel like some part of me hasn't healed up enough to go back. Like some critical piece is missing. Please understand...

## This weekend?
Julie, we're working a big run up here. It's been crazy. We probably have to go out again tonight. I don't think I can do it.

## Will you try...for me, please?
Okay, I'll try. But, listen... If I don't make it up, then you go ahead and have a great time.

## Oh...it's not working right. You're home early. Did I scare you?
Never do that again.

## Checking the locks again?
You know me to well.

## That's right. It's how the species survives. You'll never convince me otherwise. Wanna dance?
I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there.

## Who?
Ben Willis.

## You've got all these theories but where is he? Where? Where's your fisherman killer?
I'm fine.

## You sure?
I'm fine.

## The shower again?
It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.

## To get out of Southport?
Right. Now I remember.

## Nah. I'll probably just be here studying for finals. The joys of summer school... Are you okay?
I'm okay.

## Are you sure?
This was not my idea.

## I said, this...Do you want a drink?
Just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood.

## You sure it's okay with you?
Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.

## Julie? What's wrong?
It's...him.

## What do you mean, Julie?
He did something to the screen...it, it, said...

## Come on. We're gonna be okay.
What? What are you talking about? Where?

## Did you get help?
Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.

## He's in it with Willis?
I guess so.

## Why are you doing this to me?
I trusted you.

## ...Why?
Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son.

## Is there a problem here?
Where there's a Will, there's a way. Come on.

## They all start to look the same once you've worked in one. Am I right, sister?
Tha's it. I've decided. I'm changing my major to finance. And going to Wall Street.

## Why?
Cause that's the only way I'm ever gonna be able to afford a big bed like this.

## Hello?
Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho.

## Maybe we should just wait here? Hide in a tree?
I'm not hiding up no tree. I'm with her. Let's arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho's butt.

## You think that's a good place to hide?
I don't know, but I'm starving.

## Alone. In the room. Got any advise?
Why? He can't help us.

## Still here...thinking... You mean Brazil, the country?
Well, there's some flaws in her...

## How much?
Don't really have the market for something like this... I can go two...two-fifty.

## You guys lost?
Tell me this ain't the bar scene.

## What's the matter, boy trouble?
Not anymore.

## He leave you?
No. I shot him.

## What's going on?
Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.

## Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai?
The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard.

## So why are you still here?
There's ten people on this whole island and they're all gonna end up in this Jacuzzi with us.

## How's the water?
Crowded.

## Where is everybody?
Take this.

## And do what with it?
They were cut loose.

## Estes! That's exactly who it is. That old guy knows something. We can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first.
Julie? Wanna tell us what is going on here?

## We'll only be a second, okay?
Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place.

## What is up with that weirdo?
She's in her room.

## You collect these to sell, abroad?
He's dead. I want the General to see him.

## I have not been on the island in twenty years. It is changed - changed completely. Where are the graves -- the coffins?
This was once a cemetery.

## All the graves?
I'm afraid so. There were rumors people were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old superstitions.

## Did your servant got word to Dr. Drossos?
Another sad task. We'll bury her tomorrow. I think we'd better lock the door for tonight. It will make them less uncomfortable.

## Of course. Tomorrow, perhaps, before I go?
I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..

## You're not leaving tomorrow..?
I think not.

## If Mr. Albrecht is right, we'll all be free in a few days. I suppose you'll be going on to Athens?
I don't know now without my father.

## Has that girl -- has Thea ever told you where she comes from?
Some village in the mountains -- Alethera, I think.

## Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
She has never mentioned her family.

## What are you doing?
I was looking for you.

## Miss Wollsten shares the room with you?
You are fortunate in your father.

## I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -or just because he is one's father?
Why, I love my father because - because I do. Of course, he's nice to me.

## You have forgotten my last name?
I have forgotten it, dear.

## I wish I didn't have such bitter knowledge of you, Cathy.
Suppose, she isn't dead. Suppose it was a cataleptic attack?

## Whet do you mean?
Miss Wollsten!

## Would you care to explain what you're talking about?
He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.

## Yes?
I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep - I want to avoid it.

## You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?
I don't really know where Thea comes from. The ViceConsul at Adrianople brought her to me..

## Her name is Thea?
Theodosia.

## You do not know her last name -- you do not know from where she came?
Miss Wollsten - my secretary, she'd know.

## Why not Take the doctor's advice? You're the hero of the battle of Corphon.
What is her illness?

## Do you mind if I go with you?
There is something evil about her.

## Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
The rider on the pale horse is Pestilence. He follows the wars.

## Is this what you wanted to speak to me about?
In a way -- this girl, Thea. You must stay away from her.

## I had a notion you had become selfappointed chaperone lately  why?
You are my friend.

## She was born before your wife returned here to die. You never knew.
And I'm your friend  but that doesn't explain why you are always trying to come between Thea and me?

## Everything's so simple. I like you.
You're crying. Why?

## What's bothering you, Thea? Is it the General?
The General threatened me.

## Why in the world can't you?
He hates all my race.

## Are you running a business or a charity ward?
Well, all right ...

## How would you like to get a ticket next week? Haven't you any romance in you?
Sure I have, but I got rid of it.

## Who?
The groom, idiot. Come on, get that ladder.

## Ernie, I'm a rich tourist today. How about driving me home in style?
All right, put up your hands. No fast moves. Come on out here, both of you.

## Bert, what's happened to this house? Where's Mary? Where's my kids?
I hate to do this, fella.

## Don't ... George?
What did ...

## Go through with what?
Suicide.

## What are you, a mind reader or something?
Oh, no.

## Well, who are you, then?
Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.

## Odbody ... A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?
Angel, Second Class.

## Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel Second Class.

## Oh, I've got to earn them, and you'll help me, won't you?
By letting me help you.

## Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven.

## What'd you say?
I said I wish I'd never been born.

## What did you say?
You've never been born. You don't exist. You haven't a care in the world.

## Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow  you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
No.

## You don't huh? Well, you got any money?
No.

## Made what?
Every time you hear a bell ring, it means that some angel's just got his wings.

## Why? Don't they believe in angels?
You see, George, you were not there to stop Gower from putting that poison into the ...

## Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What ... are you a hypnotist?
No, of course not.

## Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.

## Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
You're nobody. You have no identity.

## What?
Zuzu's petals.

## You know where he lives?
Sure I know where he lives. He lives in Bailey Park.

## Oh, I'm not sure of anything anymore. All I know is this should be Bailey Park. But where are the houses?
Clarence ...

## Where's Mary?
Oh, well, I can't ...

## I don't know how you know these things, but tell me  where is she?
I ...

## Where is she?
Poor George ... Sit down.

## If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
Well, naturally. Of course.

## Well, keep your eyes open. See the town?
Where? I don't see a thing.

## Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out. Concentrate. Begin to see something?
That's your problem, George Bailey.

## A boy?
That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.

## What did you stop it for?
I want you to take a good look at that face.

## Who is it?
George Bailey.

## It's a good face. I like it. I like George Bailey. Tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the pills?
Not a soul.

## Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring?
Well, wait and see.

## Yes, but what happened to George?
Now, you've probably already guessed that George never leaves Bedford Falls.

## You sent for me, sir?
Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.

## Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now?
You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.

## What's that book you've got there?
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.

## The Building and what?
The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there.

## What's that?
That's the best part of it. They've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father's place.

## Is this the place?
Of course it's the place.

## Hello, Joseph, trouble?
Looks like we'll have to send someone down  a lot of people are asking for help for a man named George Bailey.

## George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his crucial night. You're right, we'll have to send someone down immediately. Whose turn is it?
That's why I came to see you, sir. It's that clock-maker's turn again.

## Well?
Mother ...

## Mother? What do you want?
Get over what? I don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody I know.

## When'd you see him last?
Today, over at the house.

## Well, what happened to you?
I won a flower.

## Wait now. Where do you think you're going?
Want to give my flower a drink.

## Will you try to get some sleep?
I'm not sleepy. I want to look at my flower.

## It will?
Fine.

## Oh, oh. Sam Wainwright! How are you? When did you get here?
Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.

## Old college graduate now, huh?
Yeah  old Joe College Wainwright, they call me. Well, freshman, looks like you're going to make it after all.

## Now you're talkin'. Gee whiz, I could use this as a raft in case the boat sunk. How much does this cost?
No charge.

## What boat you sailing on?
I'm working across on a cattle boat.

## What's that?
I own the house. Me, Giuseppe Martini. I own my own house. No more we live like pigs in thisa Potter's Field. Hurry, Maria.

## The last time he come in here. You hear that, Nick?
Oh, no, Please, don't go out this way, Mr. Bailey.

## Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school?
Uh-huh.

## Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?
Sure  Sam Wainwright.

## Hmmm?
Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.

## Well, how do you know? Did she discuss it with you?
No.

## Well then, how do you know?
Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.

## Mother, you know, I can see right through you  right back to your back collar button ... trying to get rid of me, huh?
Uh-huh.

## Mr. Gower, do you want something ... Anything?
No.

## Anything I can do back here?
No.

## Yes, sir. They have the diphtheria there, haven't they, sir?
Ummmm ...

## Is it a charge, sir?
Yes  charge.

## Mr. Gower! Mr. Gower! This is George Bailey! Don't you know me?
No. No.

## I thought when we put him on the Board of Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit.
You want a martini?

## Father, did I act like that when I graduated from high school?
Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night.

## How's that?
I say, maybe you were born older. I suppose you've decided what you're going to do when you get out of college.

## You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
Pop, do you want a shock? I think you're a great guy.

## Got a match?
Very funny. Very funny.

## What do you mean, and be bored to death?
Couldn't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too.

## Did you get a doctor?
Oh, am I glad to see you.

## Say, where's Mother?
She's home cooking the fatted calf. Come on, let's go.

## Hello, George, how are you?
Harry ... Harry ...

## Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?
Oh, yeah, yeah.

## Two cents worth of shoelaces?
She was here first.

## Hello, what am I bid?
Hello, Georgie-Porgie.

## What gives?
Nothing.

## Where are you going?
Oh, I'll probably end up down at the library.

## George, can I see you for a second?
Why, of course you can. Come on in the office here.

## Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
I know, but ...

## Avast, there, Captain Cook! Where you headin'?
Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.

## Peanut?
Hello.

## Oh, thank you, George, old boy, old boy. Now, look  if you'll point me in the right direction ... would you do that? George?
Right down here.

## What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?
George ...

## Why didn't you call me?
I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle.

## All right now, what happened? How did it start?
How does anything like this ever start? All I know is the bank called our loan.

## When?
About an hour ago. I had to hand over all our cash.

## All of it?
Every cent of it, and it still was less than we owe.

## Hello?
Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.

## And did you put the envelope in your pocket?
Yeah . . yeah ... maybe ... maybe ...

## Well, what about the Building and Loan?
Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.

## Have you notified the police?
No, sir. I didn't want the publicity. Harry's homecoming tomorrow ...

## Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me? Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?
I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.

## Well, what about all your other friends?
They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.

## Yes ... how much is your equity in it?
Five hundred dollars.

## Made up your mind yet?
I'll take chocolate.

## With coconuts?
I don't like coconuts.

## Me?
Uh-huh.

## Okay  what can we lose?
Hot dog! Just like an organ.

## I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?
Eighteen.

## Too young or too old?
Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you. Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.

## In that place?
Uh-huh.

## What'd you wish, George?
Oh, no.

## Hello, Mary. I just happened to be passing by.
I'll take it. And then what?

## About what?
About coming in. Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit.

## Didn't you tell her?
I didn't tell anybody. I just went for a walk and happened to be passing by ...

## Well, are you coming in or aren't you?
Well, I'll come in for a minute, but I didn't tell anybody I was coming over here.

## When did you get back?
Tuesday.

## Do you like it?
It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them.

## Would you rather leave?
No, I don't want to be rude.

## Don't you like her?
Well, of course I like her. She's a peach.

## Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?
That does it  come here.

## Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
To keep from being an old maid.

## You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you ... ... Your what?
My baby.

## Is it snowing?
Yeah, just started.

## Where's your coat and hat?
Left them at the office.

## What is it, a sore throat or what?
Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious.

## The doctor? Was the doctor here?
Yes, I called him right away. He says it's nothing to worry about.

## Is she running a temperature? What is it?
Just a teensie one  ninety-nine, six. She'll be all right.

## Where're you going?
Oh, George, George, George.

## What plates?
Oh, Mom  I'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen.

## Okay, Mom. You coming later? You coming later, George?
I guess you forgot something.

## Huh?
You forgot something.

## Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?
Sure, sure I am.

## How about that one there?
Hmm? Well, I ...

## How fast does this go?
With the right wind, 15-20 knots.

## You going to the lighthouse?
Come on, you guys.

## For me...?
What the hell. For you....

## When do we get to the lighthouse?
Soon, dark eyes, soon.

## Someone pop your balloon?
No problem, no problem.

## What'd you do? Memorize the tide tables?
I can't help it it sticks in my mind.

## Is she responsible for the punch?
No.

## If you're beached, why are we doing this? For practice?
Yeah.

## Why not?
I could give you a dozen good reasons.

## What the hell. Did your mom put all this together?
Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble-bubble, stroke-stroke. There sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the ocean.

## Shells and lobsters and stuff?
Mostly old garbage. Today we found a '48 Hudson.

## The lighthouse?
No big thing, we'll see who's out there, maybe picnic.

## What is it?
We're hung up on something.

## Where're we going?
Oh, out a ways. Maybe the lighthouse.

## Goddamn it, Sean, you listen to me or I will kick your ass, do you hear me?
Listen to Andy, Sean.

## You coming up on him?
You bet. Hang on....

## We're hung up here. Snagged.
How're we going to do that floating on this garbage...?

## Chief Brody -- can we go? Please?
Till noon. This is on my own time. Hi, Shorty.

## On your own time?
Happy to do it.

## I just made it up. It means, \"Get me out of there.\" What the hell's that?
Diver's camera. Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.

## Chief?
In here.

## Positive I.D.?
The woman passenger on the boat that blew up.

## That one -- from the wreck. You brought it up, did you look inside it?
Well, what the hell -- might be something worth seeing. Take it somewhere and see if there's film in it....

## The drugstore's closed? What the hell time is it?
Nine-thirty, ten maybe.

## Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close up, okay?
Oh yeah -- I'm expecting a long distance call, very important. Give them my home phone.

## How long ago?
About an hour, maybe two. Let's see -- I came on about eight....

## Where to?
No place special. Just hanging out.

## Sailing?
I don't know about him -- I'm going down to the dock, maybe go sailing.

## What else is there to do?
You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.

## Do I have to?
You'll have to make up your own mind about that.

## What about tennis? Riding? fixing up old cars? Bartending?
Bartending? I'm 17.

## Okay, not bartending. Why on the water every day?
Because.

## Is Hooper coming to dinner?
Not till next year.

## You want to come here a minute?
I got something for you to do tomorrow.

## Mike? Is that you?
Pop. I'm sorry.

## It's okay. What happened?
I passed out, but I'm okay.

## Jesus, don't freeze on me. What about the others?
Sean's still out there.

## What?
Dad, I'm sorry....

## Did you get any pictures?
Well, yeah, I did, that's the funny thing. You can't tell much from the negatives, I was going to blow 'em up. Here's a test I did....

## Let's see -- you got a minute?
Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.

## May I have this dance?
Sorry, I'm all booked up... Come, m'dear.

## Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim Chief of Police in your absence?
Temporarily? Uh...sure....

## Is that what it is?
You're damn right that's what it is.

## Come on, let's check the bite radius.
What's that supposed to mean?

## The whale's mouth?
The Shark's mouth.

## You don't tell me my job, and I won't tell you about yours, okay?
Could be a shark. But maybe not.

## Do you?
I know that this was probably a Great White Shark. Car-cadon... Caradan....

## What makes you think there might be?
Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish....

## Sound?
Sound. Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration.

## Can't you tell?
Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate? Send out signals, or something? You know, take revenge, sense an enemy....

## Where the hell were you?
Late.

## Do I have to talk to those two?
My boss and your boss. Sure.

## Why?
Because they're playing our song.

## Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?
And how. I thought you wouldn't respect me.

## Fooling around?
Right.

## Mrs. Silvera?
Mrs. Silvera.

## Need a ride?
As far as the office.

## You have to smoke so early in the morning?
It's good with coffee.

## Where's my day book?
In the den.

## Why don't you take a half day and clean this junk up?
It's an island. Got to run.

## For me?
Damn.

## Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair. Where were you?
Nothing.

## Use the little brush there. Why were you at Santos'?
Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.

## Oh. Want to talk about it?
No.

## All summer?
He wanted a job, he's got one. I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.

## Do you?
It was bad, wasn't it.

## That's great too. Gorgeous.
Are you going to be able to sleep?

## What's wrong?
Ooohh, nothing. I just got fired, that's all.

## What'd I say?
That you were fired.

## Because of today? The beach?
Stop that! We're not going any place. You love it here. Tell me what the hell happened!

## What're you going to do today?
Turn in the car. Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss.

## What're you doing?
Going out.

## What is it? What's the matter?
Mike's out there.

## Thank you, thank you. You know my son, don't you?
I'm showing summer rentals. We got a helluva season going.

## Are you serious?
Of course. Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....

## I got a feeling. I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?
Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money.

## What?
Go ahead, whatever it's worth.

## Affirmative. Can you get your chopper airborne?
10-4, in a few minutes. He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.

## What for?
There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way. Turn them back to port.

## That's it. Just do it, all right?
10-4, soon as I can raise him.

## Harbor Air, do you read? Over?
Brody? This is Patrol Base.

## Where the hell is Air One?
That's what I'd like to know. Lost transmission at Cable Junction.

## Did he raise the Kids?
Last transmission said ten juve- niles.

## Yeah? Then what?
Then nothing. If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself.

## Did you say Cable Junction?
That's what he said.

## When?
1530 hours. Might still be there. Base out.

## No. Find your brother, okay?
Some people.

## You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie. Okay?
Hi Dad.

## Is that me?
That's you.

## What's wrong?
Tide doesn't turn for three hours.

## How old is your cousin?
Seventeen. She's a senior.

## You're not going out right away, are you?
Waiting for Andy.

## Mike! Are you going out?
Maybe.

## Did you ever see a dolphin?
Sure. They like to play. We may see some today.

## Ready?
Hang on, hang on...Okay, go.

## Okay, okay, coming....
Terry! You okay?

## Get a dance yet?
Nope.

## Who'd you ask?
Tina Wilcox.

## Anyone know what time it is?
3,30.

## What's that mean?
Sideways - For every yard we go this way, we also slide sideways this way....

## Eddie, can we do that? Can we go skiing? We can use my Uncle's boat. Eddie?
Next week.

## You want to tack, or just leave her pointed up like this?
Just like this.

## What about sailing?
The tide's running. It'll take us to the light.

## What about the others?
They'll be there when we get there. Might even have a fire started.

## What're we going to do in the mean time?
I dunno. We'll think of something.

## And second?
Mmmmmm.

## What Kids? Who went out?
All of them. Mike, Junior Vaughn, Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all that whole gang.

## Mike? Our Mike?
Yep. Looked like they were headed to the lighthouse.

## What the hell, they can't fire both of us -- someone's got to be in charge, right? Which way are we going?
Be careful....

## Anything?
Rich or poor, it's nice to have money.

## Figure they split?
Happens every season -- someone takes off. Once we had a schooner for a month while the owners went fox hunting.

## How much longer?
Until we find something.

## What is it?
Power line.

## What's the lighthouse?
It's an island, near here, with a lighthouse. We sometimes hang out there, you know....

## Is there something I don't know about?
We'll be over by the lighthouse.

## You do everything your parents tell you?
No.

## What's wrong?
Uh. Well. Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in....

## Heading back?
Might as well.

## When are we going out? You and me?
Not tonight.

## You going with Patrick?
Who wouldn't.

## Anyone want to go the lighthouse?
They're turning around.

## Do I have to play with the little kids?
Yeah. Go on, beat it.

## I'm not in the way. Andy, am I in the way?
Yeah.

## Would you take him?
And if you have any questions about recreational possibilities, Ellen Brody here will be happy to answer them.

## Len, can I see you a minute?
I think we got a couple of live ones.

## How the hell do we get him down. from there?
Maybe nobody will notice. Let's get them back in the bus.

## Larry, I'm a businessman, trying to make a buck like anybody else.
What the hell is he doing?

## So? So?
So it can't be done like that. The man's a menace, plain and simple.

## Why don't you take a rest, Brian?
I'm only walking him. You caught him. You have to be exhausted.

## What's your plan, Brody?
Sure am.

## You see the three-quarter socket?
Yeah. Down there.

## Aren't you suiting up, mate?
No.

## How many sharks have you killed?
Me? I don't know. Twenty, thirty. I love them, think they're the greatest.

## Want another one?
Well, not much longer to go.

## What is it, 97 days?
Till this opens, not our wedding.

## You called, Doctor?
Everything's going wrong. I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before. I can't get him to respond.

## How come?
I don't know. I can't understand it. Something's bothering them.

## And what else is bothering you?
... Hutton. He really pisses me off.

## Sure. Want to try that new Italian place?
We play hide and seek all the time. They find a lot of things.

## Where's the rubber band?
Look, Michael... you don't have to come.

## What do I do now?
Take a deep breath and hold it.

## Honey... you all right?
No.

## Are you scared?
Yes.

## What's wrong?
Nothing.

## ... If nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here?
... Electrical connection malfunctioning.

## You sound like Houston Mission Control. What the hell does it mean?
That we swim.

## Where are you going?
Up.

## And leave me down here?
Make up your mind.

## I talked you into this?
I'd have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber.

## No, I don't want to leave now. I'm having too good a time... Of course I'm coming! You'd think you're gonna leave me?
You would, wouldn't you? I'd end up whale shit, you wouldn't care.

## I think so. I'm not sure... Are you?
I'm okay.

## God, they're horrible. I hate them. Did you see its eyes? How black they are? The look in them?
Don't think about it. It's over.

## You're going down there again?
Yes.

## After what happened to us?
I know I can capture it.

## Oh, yeah. Really nice. Who's your designer? Sassoon Shark?
I got it on sale. A real steel.

## What's that?
Bracelets.

## Wouldn't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime?
It's easier to lure sharks at night.

## Change your mind?
No.

## You want me to stay?
Get some sleep. And tell Sean I'm sorry.

## How's your patient?
Recovering nicely.

## What's up?
I need more pressure in the shark tank.

## I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow. Would you do that for me?
Sure. Let's go.

## ... Mean through the tubes?
Yes. It's faster.

## Michael, come on, don't be silly. This is the quickest way. You're not going to walk all the way around?
I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.

## Honey, what is it?
I don't understand.

## What did you just say before? About water flowing through them?
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.

## How is he?
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.

## Who's going to do it?
Me.

## Are you okay?
I'm fine.

## Go where?
On the telly. We're to film him for the evening news.

## I just did. Can you make them do tricks?
They're not tricks. They're behavior patterns.

## Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
Wait a minute. These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton. They're dolphins.

## What in hell is that?
Because I don't trust you, that's why.

## How's sleeping beauty?
Still sleeping.

## Why are you?
I like it when they wake up.

## Is there such a place? A cave or something with such a flow?
I've heard of a White that big, in Australia...

## When did this happen?
Ten minutes ago.

## Give me a ride?
Sure.

## Musclehead?
He's missing.

## Kelly, could you look after Sean for a while? Show him around for me?
Sure. No problem.

## Sean. Sean, where are you?
Someone's looking for you.

## How you doing, Kelly?
I'm Neo-Senephrened out. Think I'm catching a cold.

## So, you just get here?
Yeah, from Boston.

## How long you staying?
I don't know, it depends.

## You like Florida?
I haven't seen that much, but so far it looks great.

## You gonna work at The Kingdom?
Depends on big brother.

## Are you really?
Sure am.

## How come?
As always.

## Herpes?
Why you sonuvabitch...

## Sean, do you have herpes?
No. Of course not. Don't listen to him. He's - he's... ... my brother.

## Not for me. I don't go in the water, remember?
You're not in the water. You're in a gondola.

## Told you you'd like it.
I'm not acting! I don't want to go in it, okay?

## Now what's this do?
Goes up.

## What're you doing later?
Taking my boyfriend to the airport.

## Now what?
Gotta sneeze.

## What?
On monitor three. Was a glimpse of something.

## That?
Yes, there is goes.

## Hutton, how the hell did you get my crane?
Make sure you put this back.

## Aww, can't I keep it?
You set that thing off down there, you don't know what will happen.

## Kind of dull in there for you, isn't it? Why don't you throw in another shark?
Your friend Overman picked a hell of a time to come back.

## So where you go off to, Hutton? Some expedition in New Guinea or Outer Mongolia?
No, South Georgia.

## What the hell's there?
Polar bears.

## Polar bears in Georgia?
South Georgia, Antarctica.

## Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
Reach for the limit I always say.

## Filter system number four. Is it large enough?
It's large enough...

## How far away is filter number four?
Five hundred yards.

## After all, that's how you catch fish, isn't it?
You could also try a bamboo pole and a worm.

## What kind of trouble?
Yeah, we'll find something for you. Shoveling shark shit or something.

## Sharks?
In a restaurant. You sit there and they swim around you.

## How'd you do in school?
Great. I got one B, two C's, and eight incompletes.

## How is he? Still fighting crime?
Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring. Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac-Man games.

## Big bust! He confiscate their water pistols?
Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.

## Come on, let's go.
Who's grown up?

## You know Overman?
Okay, you two, have a good life without me. I gotta go.

## You and Kathryn gonna stay here?
This company's expanding. They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California. I think I'm gonna be going to Waco.

## Well, Dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding. Is there any chance you and Kathryn will get married in Amity?
Tell Dad we're getting married in Las Vegas. In one of those chapels. He can meet us there.

## She still talking to you?
We're in love.

## You want to show this?
Absolutely. The audience will stain their drawers. I did.

## Daddy, why can't I...?
Did you hear what I said? Come inside....

## Was Uncle Sean ever bad? Did you ever spank him?
Only children are my favorites. That means you, MaGee....

## Can I make sandwiches...?
Yes, you can make sandwiches....

## Where are you going?
Nowhere....

## How come it's my responsibility?
Because....

## We don't have anything straightened out. You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
Why should there be anything wrong? I'm sitting around the house, enjoying my day off and you start yelling at me about garbage....

## What the hell are we arguing about?
I don't know...You...I don't know.

## What's wrong? What happened?
Thea was attacked by a shark....

## You knew...?
It went away....

## Where is she?
How could you do that? Your own daughter....

## Where's my mother?
I don't know....

## Why didn't you tell us? Why didn't you tell us?
I'm sorry. Please, Carla. I didn't think there was any danger. I'm sorry. I love you. Both of you.

## Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...? About spending so much time working in the water?
Usually it's all he talks about...You mustn't worry....

## You want to try your hand at something...?
I'd be afraid of losing....

## Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?
All he did was kiss me....

## Beginning of what?
Whatever happens next.....

## We will...We'll have a lot of time together. What are you going to do now?
We'll be there....

## Michael! This thing working?
You rigged it...You spent all that money on an education and you come back looking like this....

## What the hell's it doing in warm water anyway...?
What difference does it make? It's here....

## Stop what?
That....

## Are you all right?
Adds flavor....

## I'd like that. I need to be away from here.
What's going on?

## Can I ride one sometime...?
It's too dangerous....

## Where's the lady who brings the soda?
I like Grandma's cooking....

## Who's coming?
No one. Nothing. We've got to get this finished before the tide comes in.

## What's it cost to take a ride on that plane...?
The water's coming in...The water's coming in....

## What?
I want you to give up that terrible job.

## All you all right?
I'm fine....

## How are you doing?
Okay.

## You hungry?
No.

## Why'd you take the boat?
I want you all to come to Amity this summer.

## Can you just go off...?
I'm the captain of this majestic ship. It goes where I take it....

## Mostly it feels like driving. You digging for buried treasure?
I don't know why I've told you all this. I hardly know you.

## How can you just take the plane like this?
Boss' day off...Take the wheel....

## What are you doing?
If you don't take it, we'll be swimming in a minute.

## Where do I pull off...?
You're doing fine. I'll keep you out of trouble. Relax....

## You're not going to tell me, are you?
Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....

## How do you like flying?
It's wonderful....

## What's wrong?
Nothing....

## Would you suffer through a dance with me?
You'll be sorry.

## What?
I borrow it without telling him....

## Won't you get in trouble...?
Only if he finds out... It's a short hop to the Caribbean. We could take a few days....

## Why?
Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why. Blushing suits you....

## You sure you don't need glasses?
My vision is perfect....

## I'm too young for coffee. Can I drive the plane?
I'll get it back next time.

## Want to go for a little ride?
I do....

## You the architect?
Yes I can....

## You got a better idea...?
When we find her we'll radio her position...The Coast Guard will pick her up. Don't worry....

## What do you mean, it'll find her?
She said it was coming....

## Hell, no. What kind of pilot do you think I am...?
Hell, that wasn't half bad.. Get going...I'll keep it busy....

## What do you deliver on all those charters you...?
I fly elephants for smugglers....

## Can't this thing go any faster?
Any faster and it'll turn into a flying Cuisinart and dice us into oblivion....

## Nothing! What the hell are you doing down there?
The damn thing is going to have our asses....

## Matt?
Tell Thea I'm sorry....

## Still tagging conch?
We'll be done pretty soon....

## Tricky little devils, aren't they? How's the degree doing?
Inch by inch....

## How's Ellen?
She has good days and bad...I don't know....

## You tagging them...?
I'm separating the ladies from the gentlemen....

## Where the hell's the beer...?
Bad boy....

## How many?
Stop busting my hump....

## What?
Spade's a garden tool....

## Where is everybody?
Down here....

## What happened to Clarence and...?
Gave them the day off....

## What for? We've got a job to finish ...Why are you making the monitor?
As the sun slowly sets in the West, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch....

## You sure you've done this before?
Lots of times....

## And it's always worked?
So far..

## What are we getting out of this old bucket?
What she's got. Nine knots....

## How long?
As long as he's been here....

## Who?
Hoagie.

## What's so funny about that?
You think he's not good enough for her? You're right. If she was my mother, I'd send her home right now.

## I'm coming...How close is it?
Close...I don't know...Just get the hell....

## What about Carla's gig?
I'm going down, Jake....

## What about the monitor...? You getting anything on the shark?
Nothing...Hey Michael...You know I was thinking about yesterday. Maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry....

## How come only me?
Screw you, Jake....

## What the hell are you doing?
I've got to get to her....

## That bad, huh?
We're out of decaf...We're out of petty cash...And we're out of requisition forms....

## Anything to do before I go home?
That man keeps calling about his training film. I can't convince him we don't have a S.W.A.T. team.

## Where's Lenny?
Gone to Ben Masters' place. Cow tipping.

## Cow tipping?
Claims kids come around at night and tip over his sleeping cows. They're not giving milk.

## Did you like that, Mama?
Yes.

## What?
Oh no--

## Yes, I'm gonna ride on the Shoot-the-Chutes. An' you know in the Dark Mill? Ever been in the Dark Mill?
Oh, no. I wouldn't go ...

## As I said, Sergeant, you nearly ran into me? What's the problem?
I'm afraid it's the \"van\" again.

## Is it your vehicle?
No, my mother's .. You better stop in .. I'm just here to feed the cat.

## How about any guys on your staff?
We only got one .. He doesn't drive.

## Be my guest. What you got?
Uh huh .. He's well rehearsed ..

## So what happened to the barbecues, and fishing?
Watch my lips, coz you're not gonna believe this - this is a rare occurrence. We haven't had a body in eighteen months.

## What do you think?
I think you're here all day.

## The dogs?
Two dogs. He should do the dogs.

## Who is who?
A professional, whining, con-person bitch with an ass the size of Africa ..

## How's the new residence?
O.K.

## What does that mean?
Not too good in daylight ..

## What time is it?
Seven thirty-five .. Here, \"Town Gets Top Cop.\" I was gonna pin it to your wall.

## Why so coy about the word \"frozen\"?
Because, don't get into it ...

## There's nothing in the files?
Watch my lips .. Don't get into it ..

## He thinks you stole his promotion. What exactly you doin there, John?
It's a method for quitting smoking.

## Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?
Because it's a ritual you gotta go through with. I'm down to 10.

## Maybe?
Find yourself a farmer's daughter with nice big fucking tits, and shake that \"bye-bye.\" Send it to Sacramento, John .. I sniff grief ..

## How'd you do it, old man?
Someone bet me a dollar ..

## What do you mean?
Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles.

## I think I got something - twenty two years old, dark hair - study- ing mathematics - - Last seen 5 weeks ago ..
What do you mean, Ross?

## This looks promising .. I think this one could be it?
Thank Christ we got a witness.

## What, Bro. You may as well ask one of these Beethoven guys on the piano?
Had a seeing Eye Dog since she was eighteen .. didn't I tell you those dogs meant something ..

## So am I. But where's my money?
Don't start again. If you win a bet, you can't keep winning it ..

## Why?
To throw out of the window.

## It's not your friend. It keeps you sucking. Remem- ber the old Bum's lungs?
I remember the old bastard's liver! I don't believe you did that. I had a great sent- imental attachment to that.

## How come the F.B.I. don't put anya this together? They work- ed over \"Jennifer\" for months?
Identity of whom? You got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic- ense? .. She's untraceable, John .. You need fifty detectives on this.

## I was wrong.
For a dead?

## You believe me, don't you?
What does it matter what I bel- ieve? .. What you gotta worry about is what Citrine believes ..

## All but .. How you doing?
I wish he'd tell that to Citrine.

## You looked like you did?
No, I think you'll find I looked like he could have? By accident even? He's up here spraying the scenery all day.

## Why's she blind, Bro?
Car accident.

## I never knew about the sailor the- ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files?
John, stop. The case is on its ass, you're closed. C'mon, let it go for once .. Have a drink. C'mon, relax, drink your beer ..

## You don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved?
Alright, enough, Ross. You'll bring on my \"Nervous Tick\" ...

## Don't give me that! Not another told me ..
You don't really believe this?

## I dunno what I can do to help you?
I dunno what I'd do with your help. I've gotta take her out of there ..

## What about Citrine?
Screw Citrine. He can fire me.

## Hey, John, don't start getting antsy over this tonight. It may well have been the local cops?
That's just what I wanna find out.

## Jesus. What are you doin?
I spose I'm drinking myself to sleep. It's Helena's Christmas songs .. they're really pretty ..

## What exactly you doing, John?
I'm going up to the institute.

## Now?
This \"cop\" that's calling, thinks she gonna be there over Christmas.

## Listen, you don't havta come?
Hey ..

## Where's your watch?
I guess by the bed.

## What if we need a back up?

## I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?
Yes, Sir.

## As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with.

## What kind of friend? Was he a boy friend? An old friend? New friend?
You must have some idea about him.

## When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
No.

## The elevator wasn't working?
No, it has a mind of its own.

## Is there anything else you can tell me? Anything about him or her? Doesn't matter how small?
No. Except he smoked. Like you.

## Me?
Yes, I could smell it on his breath, like I can on your's.

No.

## Did Amber have a dog?
Yes.

## What color was it?
I don't know.

## Have you been here long?
No, just a minute or two .. I knocked on your door - no one home, so I followed the music ..

Of course I would ..

## Really? What did he say?
He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.

## He said that? What else did he say?
Just your age.

## Which is what?
Fifty-seven .. I don't mind ..

## You know? How do you know?
Coz you hardly said a word since you got here. But you been thinking pretty loud ..

I don't think so .. He said the police had been calling .. want- ed to ask me some more questions ..

## You're looking worried again, Helena?
No I'm not.

## You're looking more worried now than when you \"decided to stop worrying\"?
Alright, I'm worried about Christmas. I wish I hadn't told him I'd be back ..

## Why can't I stay with you?
It's not possible right now.

## Why?
Please don't ask no quest- ions now .. Not right now ..

## Why does he want to kill me?
Coz he thinks you're a witness.

## Then why didn't he kill me?
He doesn't need my help.

## You do?
I'm blind because my father drank.

## What are you doing, Travis?
I been told to take your car in, Sir.

## Why?
I dunno, Sir. Brought you up a Chevy.

## You got a warrant for this?
Yes, Sir.

## Who sought the warrant?
The man from the F.B.I.

## You find something curious in that?
Yeah, I guess I do.

## When did John divorce?
Two or three years ago.

## You think he still loves her?
Think he still thinks about her. But not like then. Then was an obsession.

## I haven't worn heels since I was 16. I don't think I could walk in these?
Sure you can. Anyway, parties are all about standing still ..

## You think John would like it?
I think John, would love it ...

## How you doing on those shoes?
Don't mix very well with beer.

## Is that Margie?
I'm here, honey. I'm right here.

## Bobby's out .. What's the hurry?
Friday night at City Hall. Got a great chance to frighten the fat.

## So tonight she confesses?
Tonight I'm feeling lucky ..

## Except for the hair color, she looks just like Suzanne?
Well, that's who she is. Cept she can't run away.

## You want something, darling?
I wouldn't mind another B.E.E.R.

## He's not that bad of a guy ..?
Got a handshake like a partially excited penis.

## Whass going on here?
Alright, guys. We stop this now.

## I'm already walking. Where is it?
On the infill. The guy from L.A.'s just gone down there ..

## He has? .. What's he doing here?
He was waiting for you, Sir. Wait- ed a good while. Said he'd go down and take a look. I hope that's O.K.

## Damn A, it's O.K. With a bit of luck I'm goin home. What we got?
A derelict.

## Where do you fit in, Trimble?
His father's the manager, Sir. The kid was up there shooting vermin, and he found the body.

## I wonder what would make him do a thing like that?
Don't annoy me, Travis.

## The coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict?
Ask him.

## Who told you?
One of the accountants.

## And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket. Tell me again, how was it left with Cush?
It's a plan -- -- _ 51.

## What do I do? How do I spin this?
Oh honey. It's spun.

## You know I didn't ever want to hurt you.
What was our deal when we first got together? Brutal truth, remember?

## Wait. Did I just say \"hon\" to him?
Yeah, Dotty. You did. _ 50.

## Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?
Still going.

## Let me think about that. Want something to drink?
I see what you're saying.

## Wait. What do you mean?
Cush, Matt -- we have a decision to make.

## Hmm. Pretty good.
Can I help?

## Now what did you lose?
My son... my mind...

## You think so?
Oh tsht. Yes.

## So I know this is a bad time, but -- you will have a medical program, right?
Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know.

## Hello?
Sorry, that's my son and the nanny. I had the calls transferred to my home so I could go over your stuff.

## No, that's fine. What calls came in today?
Wait. That's yesterday, from the other office. Today is...

## We are?
It's all going to work.

## Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
Yep. Have a good time at school, Ray. Wish me luck.

## Thanks for inviting me over. Where's the little guy?
He's asleep. Watch out for that lamp.

## Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
And just think if I got her the ring she really wanted.

## Beer okay?
Yeah, thanks.

## Truth?
Sure.

## Sorry about this hand. You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?
Don't worry about it, boss.

## Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster. You meet Chad the nanny?
Yeah, I did -- am I dressed okay? I guess I didn't realize we were...

## What?
Let's not tell our sad stories.

## Okay. Wait here a second. Do we really want to do this?
Oh hell yes.

## Sure you're okay to drive this?
This rig? Phht. No problem.

## If I said that, would you stay?
No no. Don't do that. Don't say that if you don't...

## Will you marry me?
I was thinking I hope he doesn't get injured. I felt responsible.

## Why do you love me?
It's my fault.

## Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
I think we made a mistake here.

## What about Ray?
There's no question you'll be friends. Of course you'll be friends.

## What about medical?
He's in the living room asleep.

## As opposed to twenty angry women?
Good.

## What happened to Denver?
Not right now, Jerry.

## Do I know everything there is to know here? You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you?
Apparently, Denver wanted to deal with him instead of you.

## Said who? Sugar?
Hey, I'm learning as I go.

## Exactly. And I'm sitting here with an ant problem, look! And my brother Tee Pee's room is flooded with water. Say hello to Jerry Maguire --
Mmm. Hmm.

## It's a very personal, very important thing. It's a family motto. So I want to share it with you. You ready?
Yes.

## I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?
Yeah. And it might have even worked too.

## You believe they're shooting a Nike ad down there? Did I ever tell you my Nike story?
I gotta get back to Cushman.

## You love me now, don't you?
Very much.

## -- the kwan.
Why not?

## That's your word?
Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package. The kwan.

## Great word. Towel?
Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance.

## What do you know about dating a single mother?
Oh I know plenty. I was raised by a single mother.

## You know when you know. It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know?
No, I don't know.

## You never had The Talk, did you?
No.

## Hey, that's my word, okay?
I'm gonna have the game of my life on Monday Night Football, and show all these motherfuckers.

## What's that supposed to mean?
Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone.

## I'm trying to talk to you. How's your marriage?
Not everyone has what you have.

## Thanks for coming.
We still having dinner in L.A.?

## I missed ya. What can I say?
I think you'll know when you see him at the gate.

## Jerry. You two will be together forever.
To the pools?

## How can I make your life better?
I'm sorry what I said back there.

## Cronin's okay for lunch?
Marcee -- this is one of our agents. This is Bob Sugar, who needs to learn to knock.

## I'm fine. What's up?
I came here to let you go. _ 27.

## Pardon me?
Dick.

## Hey, man, you know they have big balloons built into cars?
No.

## And then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and I love the zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo?
Wait. I want to tell you more about my dad.

## What's going on, Jerry?
A lot. We got a big fax today... we need this commission, buddy.

## I'm scared. What is it?
It's in a cage. Do not be scared of...

## What'd I say?
He should have kept his head tucked down.

## After what you've seen today, you really think your son could be alive?
This is how you play God.

## Do you think it goes all the way across?
One way to find out.

## What is it?
We can't just...

## How much weight have you lost?
Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.

## Well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him?
Because \"Dr. Grant\" isn't looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.

## What?
Nothing.

## What did you say?
Nothing.

## We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.
Eric! Are you here?

## Well what?
This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years.

## Think.
When did you have it last?

## What?...WHAT!?
I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on him when he...

## Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men, we stick around, huh?
Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.

## We should try fishing again.
Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?

## You mean it?
I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows? Things might turn out differently.

## How low?
He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.

## Who's that?
I thought we weren't suppose to yell.

## What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, thats where he's headed.

## Where's Dad?
Just hold on.

## Okay. He loves us very very much. And I know that right now more than anything, your Dad would want to know that we're safe. Okay?
That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna. The second island.

## So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?
Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.

## He's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island. Right?
We'll be broke in four weeks.

## What?
Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag.

## Is it a rex?
I don't think so.

## How would you classify it?
Obviously a superpredator. Suchimimus. that snout.

## Baryonyx?
Not with that sail. Spinosaurus Aegypticus.

## That's because it wasn't on their list. Who knows what else they were up to?
He used to know me.

## Anything good?
Raptors, mostly.

## You remember the sounds they made?
I try not to.

## You think they could talk to each other?
To a degree we never imagined.

## In Costa Rica?
On the island.

## Which one do you prefer?
The first one. Before you where on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then.

## Any weapons, radios?
Found this, but the battery's dead.

## Did you read Malcolm's book?
Yeah.

## What did you think?
I dunno. I mean, it was kind of preachy. Chaos-this, chaos-that. And like, to me, the guy seemed kind of high on himself.

## Know what this is?
A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.

## How much of this island have you explored?
I stayed pretty close to the compound, Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's where they'd start.

## Why?
Closer you get to the water, the bigger things get.

## Do you have any kids?
No. Although I've studied them in the wild.

## The lady you called, how do you know she can help us?
She's the one person I could always count on. And she's saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her everything.

## Eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash?
No. I couldn't see.

## What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs?
The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles.

## What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby?
Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green...

## There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?
Well that's good.

## Last time I plugged it in, I suppose. Why?
Well, I'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch. You go.

## Sorry. We were saying?
It matches the pictures.

## You hear something?
No. I feel something.

## Any damage?
Minimal.

## You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
It doesn't matter what I think.

## Is there an antidote?
Like if you shoot yourself in the foot? Wouldn't matter. You'd be dead before you realized you'd accidentally pulled the trigger.

## What are you talking about?
I don't believe you.

## Are you out of your mind? I still have nightmares, my reputation's a joke, my leg is shot -- you think I need more of that?
It would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen.

## So what?
John ...

## Hi, Dad.
InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it?

## Kelly! What are you doing here?
I don't even know this woman.

## Stop saying fantastic. Where are you going?
I can't tell you. But I'll be back within a week.

## Very hurtful. Your mother tell you to say that?
No, Dad. I have thoughts of my own once in a while.

## You know, at the bus stop. With the hair?
That was about a year ago.

## Well, is he?
No. Richard talked to his parents.

## How could you possibly?
Because you said so. Maybe nobody else believed you, but I always did.

## Where does it say that?
On the side of that one truck.

## What are you guys gonna do?
Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do.

## Cancel that, Dieter.
Are you all right?! Anything broken?

## Carnivores hunt near stream beds. Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar?
You heard his, Dieter. Find a new spot. And remember, we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks.

## How close do you have to be?
Forty yards. Less, maybe. I assume it'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down.

## You rally think this'll draw the parent?
The velociraptors.

## What is that?
Piss.

## Where's the power and radio setup?
Operations building. Far end of the street.

## Do you think the rex might have the infant with it?
Possible.

## Why?
It's... behind... us.

## So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?
You cost me my livelihood. That on which I relied to support my children.

## What's he got in there?
Piss.

## Their what?
Oh, God.

## What?
Don't ask me. The guy's completely out to lunch.

## You're going too?
I lost everything I came after on this trip, but one T-rex in one theme park could single-handedly bail InGen out of Chapter 11.

## Do you see any family resemblance here?
You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous.

## Our chance to do what?
There' no reason for name calling.

## Lava?
No.

## What are they?
I don't know.

## Feeling a bit blue, are we?
Just -- flawed. Very deeply flawed.

## Why should they?
Because it exists.

## It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it?
Yes. And people will live in the absence of truth.

## Somewhere on this island, there exits the greatest predator that ever lived. And the second greatest predator must take him down.
So the truth is more important to you than your life?

## How many rounds did you find for that weapon?
Four, counting the one in the chamber.

## You gentlemen feel you have to do this now?
You're going home. I'm sending a radio call for the boats. We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them.

## Funded by whom?
John Hammond.

## Can you set up?
Oh, God.

## So what's your story, Nick?
I was a cameraman for Nightline for six years, been freelance since '91. Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.

## That must be interesting. What drew you there?
Women. 'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.

## Very noble of you. You don't think you're bringing that thing onto the island, do you?
Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths.

## Oh, please. How am I supposed to keep a straight face when -- -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?
Ian's a very good friend of mine.

## That little black line?
Hey, we came here to observe, you came here to strip-mine the place! It's a looter mentality, all you care about is what you can take.

## Can the kid walk?
You've got to be kidding.

## You're sure we have to?
It's not worth taking the chance, John.

## What?
The door security systems are shutting down.

## Phones are out too.
Well, Nedry said a few systems would go off-line, didn't he?

## I will not do it. You'll have to get somebody else, because I will not.
Where did the vehicles stop?

## How many lines of code are there?
Uh - - about two million.

## How would we cut off the lysine?
No trick to it. Just stop running the program. Leaving them unattended.

## How long will this take?
Bout thirty seconds.

## Dodgson, Dodgson. We got Dodgson here! See, nobody cares. Nice hat. What are you trying to look like, a secret agent?
Oh, I'll get 'em all.

## What? No menthol?
Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry. The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then.

## Uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?
Yours was fully illustrated, honey.

## Oh, you know, if it's alright, I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish with the trike. Is that okay?
Imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing. Seems to happen about every six weeks or so.

## Six weeks?
Yes, mitotic, pupils should be constricted.

## Are you sure?
Pretty sure.

## I'm sorry for the dramatic entrance, but I'm in a hurry. Will you have a wee bit of a drink now and then?
I have samples all over the kitchen.

## Could I have a tissue please?
Fascinating animals, fascinating.

## They'll all be fine. Who better to get the children through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?
John....

## Good! Keep going, now. The cable will terminate in a big, gray box.
Why?

## They died together?
The taphonomy sure looks that way.

## You know, if you really wanted to scare the kid you could've just pulled a gun on him.
Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments. Velociraptor?

## Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing. What's so wrong with kids?
Oh, Ellie, look. They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.

## The what?
The Cretaceous.

## Okay, who's the jerk?
Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....

## And what are those?
Small versions of adults, honey.

## So what are you thinking?
We're out of a job.

## And when she swallows the stones, she swallows the poison berries too. That's what makes her sick. Good work Tim.
Wait a minute! How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?!?

## Are you sure?
I'll just finish. Yeah, I want to finish.

## It's just the two raptors, right? You're sure the third one's contained?
Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors.

## The fences are electrified, right?
I can't wait anymore. Something went wrong. I'm going to go get the power back on.

## Why not?
Unpredictability....

## Dino droppings?
Yeah.

## Can we chance moving him?
Please - - chance it.

## Yes?
He sends his apologies.

## Why not?
Because he's like me. He's a digger.

## What are we looking for?
In a box under my seat.

## Are they heavy?
Yeah.

## The full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place?
No, we don't have any animatronics here. These are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.

## I've never been a rich man. I hear it's nice. Is it nice?
Thank you.

## And his book was a lot fatter than yours.
Hey! Where are the brakes?

## Really?
These look kind of familiar.

## That's okay. Listen, give me your hand.
Are you okay? Can you move? Tim! Are you okay?

## Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?
Yes it is.

## It's just like coming out of a tree house. Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?
No.

## What if the car falls? What if the wheels fall?
You got me.

## It's so strong! Look at its nose. Need help?
Come on, try some. Take a bite.

## It's a bit of a climb. You guys think you can make it?
Nope.

## You have no idea.
So you two dig up dinosaurs?

## You got any kids?
Me? Oh, hell yes. Three. I love 'em. I love kids. Anything at all can and does happen.

## You're married?
Occasionally. Always on the lookout for the future ex- Mrs. Malcolm.

## Machines hate you?
Yeah, they hate me.

## You want to talk about this?
No.

## Well, I didn't ask. Why wouldn't they be?
Kids get scared.

## Where does he think he's going?
When you gotta go, you gotta go.

## For today, I guarantee it.
What? What can we do?

## And who in God's name do you think you are....?
John Hammond. And I am delighted to finally meet you in person Dr Grant.

## Well, I'm afraid I do. There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe. He represents my investors. He says they insist on outside opinions.
Not just kids - - for everyone. We're going to open next year. Unless the lawyers kill me first. I don't care for lawyers. You?

## What kind of opinions?
No, I'm sorry, that wouldn't be possible. We've just discovered a new skeleton, and - -

## That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?
The brachiosaur? Thirty.

## Wu?
Robert. Robert Muldoon, my game warden from Kenya. Bit of an alarmist, I'm afraid, But he's dealt with the raptors more than anyone.

## What does he mean by \"target audience\"?
It's safe.

## Go that's the way we're going to go. What do you say?
Alright.

## Hear that? Are you hearing this?
I guess we'll just have to evolve too.

## What if the dinosaur comes back while we're all asleep?
I'll stay awake.

## All night?
All night.

## I am gonna have to find the others and get you to a doctor. Will you look after Tim, Lex?
Yes.

## Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler -- you've heard of Chaos Theory?
Your silence intrigues me.

## I think perhaps I'll just sit down. I don't suppose you think all that much of me now, do you?
That will teach you to trust Grandpa.

## Why didn't I build in Orlando?
I'll keep an eye on it. Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.

## Well?
What if we fall? I hate trees.

## What?
Hey Lex, you forgot to say gazundheit.

## Hello?
Ken, it's Bruce. Listen, we've got a nibble on the Pendleton financing.

## Really? How much?
Fifty.

## You want to put in chain saws?
No, no... listen, when I get back to New York we'll meet with the Board.

## Do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety-eight percent in the last ten years?
No, but...

## And do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks Crystal Lake is filled with corpses?
That's not true...

## Yeah?
I think we're lost.

## Who is this? What's going on?
This is Janet Davenport -- I'm the Realtor.

## Where's Ken? Is he all right?
I don't know...

## Janet, are you okay? Are you there?
He... he's here...

## Who's there?
Oh my god... this is his house... _we're in his fucking house_...

## Janet, goddamnit, what's going on?
Jas... Jason Voorhees... he's here...

## What?
You're about to be a media darling -- you might want to dress the part.

## What's going on?
It's still on.

## What?
His camera... it's still recording.

## What happened?
_Krueger_...

## Who?
Come on.

## Three. Where's my client?
Your... client is being booked right now. He'll be in cell five.

## What are the charges?
I thought that was Ted Bundy.

## A house?
That's right. Wasn't on any of the maps... we could barely see it through the underbrush. Place must've been abandoned for twenty years.

## Who's chest?
Jason's. It came out of his chest... a hand with long blades on the fingers...

## Are you going to plead insanity?
Sorry.

## So... why can't Jason get a fair trial?
Because everyone knows he's guilty...

## You think that's going to work?
I don't know if anything's going to work in this case. Therefore, we have to try everything.

## You watch this garbage?
This is a legitimate cinematic genre. Just like Westerns, Comedies, Film Noire, Science Fiction...

## Well?
He's fucking nuts.

## Doesnit sleep?
Insomnia. Not unusual for someone in his situation. Not to mention he's a bed-wetter.

## He wets the bed?
I always throw that in. It makes the jury feel sorry for the defendant.

## Oh?
One of the deputies is pretty cute. I think she likes me.

## This sexual obsession of yours. Have you considered going into therapy yourself?
No need. I'm self-diagnosed. I have severe nympholepsy... And I'm a bed-wetter.

## So, what are you saying... that he didn't kill all those people?
My job is not to determine his guilt or innocence. That's up to the jury. My job is defend him.

## Oh?
Not much here. Jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia... that's about it.

## That's pretty weird. Is it possible for someone to not sleep for months?
Insomnolesence...

## So Jason doesn't sleep... how does that help us?
Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions...

## How do we prove it?
Then I'd say it's bedtime for Jason.

## How long will he need to be asleep?
We're going to need at least two full REM cycles to get a clear neurological profile. Three hours minimum, six hours ideal.

## Cute waitresses?
That's open to debate.

## Well, I'm onto something more useful. You ever hear of a man named Fred Krueger?
Krueger... doesn't ring a bell.

## Yeah, what is it?
_It's a second REM pattern_.

## So what do we do?
I don't suppose I can go back to the University and chase young coeds again... pretend this whole thing never happened...

## Great. When can you do it?
Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department.

## You're not going to be there?
I was there once... that was enough. Besides... I have to go out to Jason's house tomorrow. They're... digging up some new evidence.

## You saw him?
A cameraman caught him on videotape. Joe, I saw an entire sheriff's squad fighting and losing against an enemy that wasn't there...

## What are you doing?
Checking out a theory. Just keep talking to him.

## How's that possible?
I don't know... but I think he's pissed.

## You know how to use one of those?
I used to go hunting with my father when I was a kid.

## Think it'll do any good?
Krueger's in the real world... maybe he's mortal, like us.

## And if he's not?
Then we're all in a lot of trouble.

## So you think it might counteract Krueger's ability to make us hallucinate?
Ten CC's of this shit and you won't be dreaming about anything.

## How long will the effect last?
About ten minutes.

## Are you all right?
For the moment! You've only got about two minutes left! Hurry! Ruby takes off towards the Cineplex...

## What happened? Where's Jason?
My client... is dead. But I think he's a free man.

## You work in the insurance department?
You have been hearing the sordid side then.

## Where do you live?
Up there.

## What is it really?
Well, as long as I admire it from afar it shouldn't worry me if it's hollow.

## Have you worked here long?
No, no, no -- quite a long time, yes.

## Heralds of a new age -- does that sound immodest?
You could say we represent the unofficial view of a well-ordered society.

## -- Ah, but what if it wasn't?
-- Small.

## Did you?
The needles inscribing the judgement into the flesh of the man. Very good.

## These strange stories you write -- they come naturally, do they?
Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.

## Success or nothing?
No -- not even success. My writing is not for making a living -- it's for living. Not for other people, it's for me.

## What made you think I'd be able to get you into the Castle?
In a manner of speaking.

## Yes.
An empty tomb?

## Another one?
If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them. All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.

## Did you see him?
I've never seen him. I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.

## He has it, he just hasn't noticed it yet, all right?
In an organization as efficient as ours, if a document once in a great while gets lost it might never be found at all.

## Are you looking for Gabriela Rossmann?
Yes.

## Good morning -- Or should I say good afternoon?
Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.

## ... My ... social situation?
I usually take lunch by the River.

## Was there something else?
No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation. He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.

## I've never seen you here before.
Why would you suppose so?

## Have you looked?
Well -- nice to know life exists outside the office.

## I was having an affair with Eduard. He didn't tell you?
No.

## What?
That he was -- satisfied in that regard. I didn't want to pry.

## What's funny?
This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.

## The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here? This will always be the ghetto.

## There are some people I'd like you to meet. Can you come to the Musil district at eight o'clock?
... All right.

## You almost married recently, didn't you?
Last year. I -- it was broken off.

## And you ...?
I'm suspicious of men who want to marry. I believe they think it's the only thing that will make them equal to their fathers.

## What of it?
And you still maintain -- what? That he was murdered.

## My only concern is the human tribunal. Isn't it yours?
Yes -- which is why \"quiet, dependable people\" have to take charge of their own lives.

## Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?
Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.

## Why were you given notice?
They're not obliged to tell.

## How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
I've heard of it happening.

## And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
Usually.

## Now Burgel's one of the authorities?
Gabriela! -- you did get away.

## Gabriela ...?
Only two steps back? Even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that.

## When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?
Wednesday. We left the office together.

## Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?
No, we said goodbye outside the building. He went off, as usual, toward his house.

## Would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close?
Yes. Since he came to the office, almost three years ago, we've been quite good friends. How was Eduard ...

## He was found in the River. Could he swim?
I don't know.

## Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?
No, I suppose not.

## Can I ask -- how you found me?
His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.

## What makes you think so?
... Just a perception.

## If someone was waiting here in the hallway to spirit her away, wouldn't they have shut the door as quietly as possible?
That's been noted. But where does it lead us? Unless you have something more to add.

## What did she say?
That the police may have allegiance to something other than truth.

## Do you?
We saw her naked once -- didn't we.

## ... Why take me into your confidence?
That's obvious, isn't it? We have an opening for a new member.

## May I ask where your two warders are?
Lying in the gutter where they belong.

## What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?
\"Raban\" -- that'll be nearly at the back of the alphabet.

## It's gone out so quickly?
-- You mean my Chief has it.

## Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain. A great loss.
All these in the last year?

## Where do our records go to in the Castle?
We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section.

## We've been together too long. His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.
Gabriela Rossman was here looking for you. Do you know her?

## -- How would you like to be in a horrible situation like that?
Oskar!

## Now Ann ...
What's to become of us now?

## What have you got there?
I think you're trying to run before you can walk, Ann.

## Value? ... Value?
They' re dead.

## Native costume?
Yeah, I saw her ... she was carried into the jungle by ... an animal.

## What was it, Jack?
An ape ... some kind of ape.

## What?
The girl's dead, Driscoll. There's no point continuing on.

## How about Ann? Is she going with you?
Haven't seen her - not since we got back.

## Are you nervous Jack?
Nab- Let's get it over with.

## Did you fear for your life?
Yeah.

## It must have been terrifying?
Yeah.

## Are you gonna start it up?
Yeah.

## Why?
Coz of something I lost.

## What's that?
What about him? Yes.

## Did he come around often?
Trina this is Klute. I told you about him.

## Not young; he wasn't young -- gray at the temples, he -- well actually he looked like you.
Yes?

## Yes?
I'd just be guessing.

## Do you always have to repeat?
Sorry.

## Well I have to close up now.
No.

## Look -- could I use your phone?
Yes indeed.

## Oh well that shouldn't take you more than another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it?
We don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more.

## Is that why Klute didn't tell me?
I guess he figured it was better.

## Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call.
What was better? I made better bait?

## No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well -- Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me?
Yes.

## Then it doesn't matter what I do any more, does it?
I'm not going to hurt you, absolutely, I'm not.

## If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes.

## Excuse me Miss Daniel?
I said yes, I see.

## What about?
My name's John Klute.

## Who?
Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.

## Why?
You know what I'm talking about. Miss Daniel.

## You're not police or FBI; you're just a private investigator?
Mm.

## And you just want to ask me a few questions?
Or you'll get me shoved back in the brig you mean; another month with the bull-dykes.

## Is that how you get most of your dates? Someone gives your name to someone else?
You're very square. Pimps don't get you dates, cookie; they just take the money.

## Mm? Oh, he was my old man. We broke up.
What about the old gentleman the other night, Mr. Faber?

## -- OK?
No thanks.

## You've changed your mind? You do want to play?
I don't want you to look up. There's someone on the skylight.

## Tell me about acting -- what are you doing tomorrow -- where do you go?
I go on rounds.

## Can't you get him?
Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't.

## Do you know where he got the dumper?
He never told me.

## Did you like my friend Frankie?
No.

## About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.

## Oh golly, oh just what I've always dreamed of, dirty phone calls. How come?
Try some other ways.

## What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me?
Yeah, you got to me.

## Oh. No. Not that way. I'd say it was more -- I don't know -- -- too bad? Pathetic?
Goodbye.

## Not much point to this, is there?
Mm.

## When?
Arlyn Page.

## Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
Frankie kept them in the same apartment, it cut his travel-time.

## What's the matter?
What the hell do you think's the matter. I could wait for you someplace.

## How?
The same as Jane McKenna.

## What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.
Why?

## How can you do it to yourself?
I don't get you.

## Ligourin, How could you do it?
I told you before, you wouldn't understand.

## I don't like getting splashed.
No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?

## I saw Mr. Faber. You remember Mr. Faber, don't you?
Yeah.

## What am I supposed to say?
Spangler says we have a relationship.

## What?
Go down in my room.

## Ah, Schmendrick -- what's the scam?
Those were police laboratory people, they've been over the apartment.

## Where'd you spend last night?
With Trina.

## Mm.
How do you know how bad it was?

## You're going back?
Mm.

## Well suppose I hadn't come downstairs. Would you just have folded up and sneaked away?
No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me.

## You wanted to, or you are?
I am.

## What?
Doesn't scare me. I think we could handle it.

## Can I carry something for you, to the car? Will you kiss me?
No. I'm sore.

## All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?
It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.

## Where, how?
I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.

## How is it back there?
Sorry we had to meet here. But I'm pressed for time.

## You said Trask was arranging laboratory work. Police laboratory. Anything from that?
Yeah. It wasn't Tom.

## That who?
Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.

## What?
You were hired to look for Tom.

## Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients?
No. It's ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.

## I can talk it over; possibly I can get the money. When are you meeting the man?
Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and 73rd Street.

## John, how are you?
I'll be sending you on a report tonight.

## What's in it?
It's in the report.

## Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?
I wanted to give it to you first.

## They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
Look -- dad -- I may stand better with the cops than you.

## Why didn't you tell Bree, afterwards?
You don't tell them. That one of their own in-laws laid a dumper on them? Peace in the family. Beyond that, I don't know. All she wrote.

## Has she talked with you since prison?
Town Police.

## Then how are you involved?
I know Tom Grunemann.

## You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
We grew up together. Kids.

## Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
No.

## Marital problems in general? Indicates possibly -- am I right Sergeant?
Everybody's got some, I guess.

## Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York?
No.

## But if Cable killed Grunemann why would he get you hired to look for Grunemann?
Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.

## What about Grunemann's letters to the girl, everything like that?
He called this morning from Tuscarora. Asked me to meet him at 3,00 at the downtown heliport. He's on his way to Chicago.

## Well?
Yeah.

## Think this is our guy?
I don't know. It looks familiar to me.

## But what reason could he have? What possible reason?
Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.

## What else do you know?
We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder - there's not even a body.

## Yes?
I'm Dr. Alvarez, Judge Atkins asked me to look in on your son and prepare an evaluation sheet.

## Where is the child?
He's in his room, playing.

## Mr. Kramer, do you ever have sex in here with anyone?
Doctor, I attempt to conduct my social life discreetly. At the moment I am seeing no one.

## Does that distress you?
Not particularly.

## What does?
The prospect of losing my child.

## What do you have here, Billy?
Detroit.

## I see you have people there. What are their names?
That's Kim...and this one's Thelma and that's Mrs. Willewska and this is daddy and that's Batman and over there is Robin.

## What about your mommy?
Oh, sure. Here, this can be mommy.

## What do you like best about her?
Lunch in a restaurant.

## What do you like best about your daddy?
Playing.

## Tell me, does your daddy ever hit you?
He hits me on the planet Kriptarium, when I steal the buried treasure from the famous peanut butter factory.

## My daddy doesn't hit me, silly. Why would my daddy hit me?
Ladies and gentlemen...

## When is mommy coming back?
Soon. Very soon.

## Wow! French toast, really?
You forgot the milk.

## What about my orange juice?
Right. One O.J. coming up.

## When is mommy coming back?
Soon. I told you before, very soon.

## Will she pick me up after school?
No. If I'm not here, you go home with Thelma and Kim.

## What if she forgets?
I'll call Thelma and remind her, okay? Don't worry.

## Yeah?
Can I be excused? I'm not hungry.

## Sure. Too much birthday cake, right?
I guess...

## Look, I'm sorry I yelled, okay?
That's okay.

## Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table?
I don't care. I hate it. I want pizza.

## Yeah?
I'm sorry...

## You mean for good?
I don't think so.

## Yes?
Yep.

## Is that really your chair?
Uh huh...

## Wow! That's neat. Can I sit in it?
Sure.

## Did mommy ever see this?
No, she never did.

## Are you going to get remarried?
I don't know. I hadn't thought much about it.

## Are you going to remarried Phyllis?
No.

## What did you do when you were little?
I guess about the same kind of things you do.

## Was there apple juice when you were little?
Yeah, there was apple juice.

## Was there Burger King?
Uh, uh. There was no such a thing as Burger King.

## Why does he decide?
Because...Well, that's what he does. He's a very powerful man.

## Like a principal?
I don't understand, daddy.

## Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?
At your mom's. She'll have a bed for you in your own room.

## Where will my toys be?
I'll send your toys there and I'm sure you'll get some new ones.

## Who will read me my stories?
Your mom.

## Daddy, what if The Face comes when I'm at mommy's?
Your mom knows all about The Face, okay? Don't worry, she'll tell The Face to beat it.

## Sustained.
Will you come and say good-night to me every night?

## Are you introducing the question of negligence here, counselor?
Yes, your honor.

## This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise.
I see. Well, you'll have to do better than that. Do you have any affidavits to support negligence?

## Does the witness deny the injury took place?
No, counselor, I'm going to over- rule you on this line of questioning.

## Now then, Mrs. Kramer, would you tell the court how long you were married?
Six years.

## And would you describe those years as happy?
The first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult.

## Mrs. Kramer, did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex-husband?
No, I did not.

## Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time?
Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.

## And what is your present salary?
I make thirty-one thousand dollars a year.

## Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?
Yes. Very much.

## Mr. Kramer, why did you set up residence in New York?
Because my son is here. And his father is here. As a mother, I don't want my child to be separated from his father.

## Mrs. Kramer, can you tell the court why you are asking for custody?
Objection.

## Objection!
Objection, your honor. The answer is, to be generous, very vague.

## Can you recall any particular incident that relates to Mr. Kramer's care of his child?
No further questions. Thank you Mrs. Phillips.

## Now then, Mr. O'Connor, how long did Ted Kramer work for you?
Eight, almost nine years.

## And did you have a close personal relationship?
Yes...

## And how did you find his work?
It was good. He was a hard worker, a lot of drive, a real hustler.

## Now then, Mrs. Kramer, you said you were married seven years. Is that correct?
Yes.

## Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way?
No.

## Would you describe your husband as an alcoholic?
No.

## A heavy drinker?
No.

## Was he unfaithful?
No.

## Did he ever fail to provide for you?
No.

## How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
I don't recall.

## More than three, less than thirty- three--permanently?
Somewhere in between.

## Is that...permanent?
I...I don't know...

## Whom you've seen twice in a year? Mrs. Kramer, your ex-husband, wasn't he the longest personal relationship in your life?
I suppose...

## How long was that?
We were married two years before the baby. And then four very difficult years.

## Were you?
Yes.

## What about Billy?
I'm not taking him with me.

## What?
Ted, I can't...I tried...I really tried but...I just can't hack it anymore...

## Where are you going?
I don't know...

## How's the new job?
Fine.

## Yes...How's Billy?
I can't help but feel somehow... it's my fault. I keep thinking I could've done something-- stopped it...

## You have?
A few times. Sometimes I sit in that coffee shop across the street and watch when you take him to school.

## You've been living here, in the city?
Ted...The reason I wanted to see you...I want Billy back.

## Joanna, I don't give a--
Are you out of your mind?! You're the one that walked out on him, remember?

## Such as?
Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--

## What?
He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two...He's yours... I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours...

## Only can I still see him?
No more waiting in Coffee Shops ...I promise.

## Okay...I think I'll go talk to my son now. How do I look?
Beautiful.

## But...just in case...I mean, just on the off chance she doesn't. What are you going to do about the kid?
I don't know, Jim. This whole thing has happened so...Pow-- like that.

## What the hell is this?
I don't. Jim, this isn't anything like what we talked about. It's not even close.

## Yes, what?
Yes, I'll have dinner with you.

## And?
He wanted to know if I liked fried chicken.

## Okay, Phyllis, what's up?
Kramer...

## What?!?
I can't. I've got Billy to take care of.

## How should I know?
Murray.

## So...what's so terrible about that?
Kramer, I'm sorry. All I was trying to do was--

## So, naturally, you assume that since Joanna left, that would be a compelling point against her, right?
Right.

## Yeah?
I've been offered a job in Washington with H.E.W.

## And?
I'm going to take it.

## What?
Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice. It'll kill twenty minutes.

## Three months. How can you tell?
Mr. O'Connor called. There's a meeting with the Revlon people in the board room and you're fifteen minutes late.

## First, there's no such thing as an open and shut case. Especially where custody is involved. Got it?
That's if we win. If we lose, you could end up having to pay your wife's court costs as well.

## Good. You've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer, Mr. Kramer. How old is the child?
Six.

## Do you want the kid or don't you?
Mr. Kramer, would you tell the court exactly why you want to retain custody of your child.

## I lost him? I lost him?
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

## What if I fight it?
We can appeal, but I can't guarantee anything.

## Mrs. Phillips, how long have you known Ted Kramer?
Six years. Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building.

## Can you describe the relationship between Mr. Kramer and his son?
It's beautiful. It's just beautiful. They have a beautiful relationship.

## John?
Ted, I won't lie to you, we don't have a hope in hell of winning a custody hearing if you're out of work.

## Ted? Are you there?
Yeah.

## Any prospects?
Don't worry. I plan to have something within twenty-four hours, John.

## How the hell are you going to do that?
I don't know.

## But I'm going to have to take some stitches.
You ever see her talk to the walls?

## How many?
Ten.

## Listen, Joanna Kramer's got a goddamn good life. She's got a husband that loves her. She's got a terrific kid. She's got a wonderful home--
Things? What kind of things?

## What are you going to do?
I don't know, Thel...This whole thing has happened so...Pow, like that.

## I'm gonna keep him, why?
Look, this is nothing personal, but I don't think you can do it.

## I've got enough trouble raising my own kid. I don't need another one. Got it?
Got it.

## You're on your own, understand?
I understand.

## You're sure?
I'm sure.

## How many onions does it say to use?
Three. And add some basil.

## D'you think you and Charley'll ever get back together again?
No. I don't think so.

## Thel, you ever hear from Joanna?
Not for a couple of months. The last time I heard from her she was living in San Francisco.

## California?
Uh, huh...She said she had a good job, was playing a lot of tennis. She wanted to know all about Billy.

## She ever ask about me?
Uh, huh...Yeah...

## He's okay...Thel, can I ask you a favor?
Sure.

## You heard anything yet?
Any day.

## You and Charley?
Hey, that's terrific.

## Huh.. .Hello?
Ted, what are you talking about?!

## Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying. Where's Joanna?
Ha! You tell me.

## All quiet?
Yes, Holiness.

## Where are you from?
Kham, Holiness.

## Again?
Tell me.

## Not the way to talk to people.
No cried?

## Can I do anything I want?
No.

## Are you? Of whom?
I do, now.

## Where will you keep them?
Here. We'll collect them.

## Can I free the prisoners?
Hmmm.

## Are you, General?
We want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed.

## How much tea do you drink, Prime Minister?
It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian.

## Why is it necessary for the Chinese to keep so many soldiers in Lhasa?
To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.

## CHIN-WU Have you heard the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement?
I have.

## CHIN-WU Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?
Soon.

## The Sera monks have surrendered?
It is calm.

## Did you receive the letter?
We did not.

## And the United Nations? Surely?
The United Nations voted not to hear our appeal.

## I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking.

## Holiness?
Yes.

## Oh, no. Where will he go?
Far, far away.

## How many?
Two.

## This many?
Yes, yes. Your brothers are here.

## Who am I?
We do not know.

## I accept it. What are the causes of suffering?
I need to squeeze this brain.

## Do you have money?
You can't do anything real until you are Dalai Lama.

## May I listen to the news with you, Holiness?
Please.

## How big is Tibet's army?
Roughly five thousand men.

## Is that big?
No. Not very big.

## Will we be in this war?
No. This war is almost over.

## Will we ever be in war?
In the Pacific Ocean.

## Where is Alsace?
I do not know, Holiness.

## What was the warning of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama?
He warned about the future of Tibet.

## What is the danger from the Chinese, now?
The war is over. This is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.

## Can India help us?
India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.

## Britain?
Britain chooses not to.

## And, America?
America, we shall see.

## Has anyone died?
The radio contact said one officer had died. Then he said, \"The Chinese soldiers -- they are coming.\" And then, the radio went dead.

## Where is that?
In the Americas.

## And then they would concede that the times are desperate and we must go to Peking. Agreed. Send Ngabo. Is that all?
It is unlikely. America, perhaps. There is great anti-communist feeling in America.

## Did you ever doubt it?
I had relinquished doubt.

## We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.

## TUNG Yes, I am aware. How has your time in China been?
I have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments. Industrial progress. Great efficiency. Your people are capable and courteous.

## I have one more piece of news. A baby is coming.
But you will always be here?

## Do you think I must?
You decide.

## Does he have the spot?
He does, a little spot where the butter had been.

## What do you think?
True.

## What does the butter spot feel like?
Soft. Nice. I have a good friend back in Lhasa.

## Is that true or pretend?
It is a story, you decide.

## Where is Poland?
This is Tibet. And this is China.

## You will not come?
No, Holiness.

## Am I running away?
The people will cry when they learn you are gone. But they would all want you safe.

## You, kill me?
Eliminate you.

## Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
I do.

## How could I ever leave?
It may not be your decision to make.

## You are unharmed?
Completely.

## Good. Where is Reting Rinpoche now?
If we agree that we are part of China, nothing else will matter. Not trade, not defense. We will be lost.

## What should I do about my doubt, Teacher?
It is a difficult situation.

## I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.

## Did you love your husband, before you married?
I did not know him before I married him. I loved his brother, but then, I married his brother, too. He is dead now.

## Does he treat you fairly?
No.

## Too young?
Much too young.

## No. Do you?
You can't take a cow by eminent domain.

## And how would you have accomplished this, Ma'am?
I haven't broken any laws.

## Ma'am. Your husband, Bernie. You didn't, by any chance, lead him to the lake blindfolded?
No kill him, though. But it was all... it was a mistake.

## Why are we landing?
They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time.

## And what would he do come winter?
Around here. Yeah.

## Keystone what?
Species, keystones affect the entire ecosystem, that could explain all these worms, the water. You've got a crocodile. Bury your friend.

## No!! What's with digging the holes?
Crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt.

## Is this a trick?
I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.

## Was he a good man?
Yup.

## Asia? How... how could he get here?
Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet.

## Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
Bite.

## What's that?
It came from across the lake.

## Just spit him back out. Some shall live, some shall die, arbitrarily, sound like any higher power we know?
He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear.

## That sounds good but underneath it's hurtful. Nightcap?
Raincheck.

## And again. How would you get him on land?
That's actually the easy part.

## You ready on shore?
We're ready.

## Where? Where?
Thirty meters or so. Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.

## Can you confirm visually or just radar?
Radar, he's underwater. But he's definitely coming.

## You take care.
You shoot on my order. If he charges, I'll be yelling \"go\" which means drivers take off. And drive fast, they can move on land. You set?

## You talk to Bickerman?
She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.

## Women's intuition. Are there anymore?
Just those two.

## None of us actually saw anything. I realize this Sir, but something flipped us over, I doubt very much it was a mink.
If he's here, I'll find him. Did she tell you we had sex together?

## What's going on?
Such the flirt.

## And what if I tranq him Kelly? He drowns. You think about that?
I'm just saying last resort.

## As if. Will you miss me?
He was an Indo-pacific.

## Are you sure?
Hector. What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.

## Oh, bullshit.
Excuse me?

## Didn't even sound good?
No.

## Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
Yes. You may. But maybe... I don't know...

## Could we have intercourse?
They're not going to be able to snag him in pitmans. Tranq him in water, he drowns.

## And how would we neutralize him?
We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs.

## He's gonna live?
Yeah. Thanks to you.

## Did you make anything of the tooth?
Yes, it did, obviously. It probably somehow got lodged into his body.

## How big do the bears get?
Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in water maybe. But...

## And they're sure he didn't get tangled under the outboard somehow?
Hank says he's sure.

## Never been to Maine before?
I was told they discriminate against people with hygiene. I never believed it.

## What?
If this is who I think.

## Who?
Hector Cyr. He's a rich kook mythology professor. He's done some work with our museum. He also treks the world to swim with crocodiles.

## In Maine?
There have North.

## Baby crocs?
Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there...

## If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible?
Because they just consult their little indigenous charts.

## What are you doing?
Skipping stones. Look how flat that water is, you can get ten skips on a good one.

## Night.
I beg your pardon?

## He thinks they're what?
In his defense, every primitive culture known to man deified them. He's a mythology professor, he thinks crocs are divine conduits.

## Yeah. Nobody saw anything?
No. U.S. Wildlife is on their way.

## Are you okay?
Um... y'know... Yeah.

## What are you talking about?
I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake and a monster that bites heads off... you look good.

## Like little children. You okay?
Yeah. I got some stuff for your cut.

## I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant. That bear had to be surprised.

## Who taught you be be a nurse?
Father's a surgeon. I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here.

## That's why you're here. To get in the middle of something?
I heard something.

## Thing we can lift it?
Maybe. Don't mush it.

## What?
Look.

## Good idea.
You wanna kill yourself, that it, you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide?

## Are we crazy?
Well...

## He doesn't seem to be swimming. Is he swimming?
He's floating. Take it home.

## Well...
You wouldn't?

## You wanna ride in my truck?
You sure? I don't mind...

## Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world. You found anyone in yours?
No.

## Worth a try. We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
Probably not.

## We set?
Ready. A museum in New York sent us some additional back up.

## You gonna dig up that lady's husband?
I'll call the coroner.

## What's that?
White perch.

## Are they feeding?
Doesn't look like it.

## Even if we could tranq him-- how would we get him on land.
Alright, Ms. Paleontologist. I wanna know why that monster is here. You got a theory?

## He just came up screaming.
Other than to eat us?

## Did he say anything?
He just kinda gurgled. He was pretty much dead.

## And you didn't see anything?
The lake was dead calm until up he came. The tooth is in there.

## That's where they keep them. You want me to bring the tooth out here?
Um. No, no. Let's go.

## Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?
Well. At wakes.

## This... how long did this attack go on for?
Seconds. Three, four.

## And this is how he came to the boat?
Yes.

## You talk to the married couple?
Not yet.

## What?
Sorry. I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.

## What?
Lightweight Forward Area air device unit. Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.

## And you stock these things for what, to fend off Russia?
Sheriff.

## We're staying in tents?
I told you. Two days, we'd have to camp.

## What?
I thought I saw...

## With what?
Crocodiles. He's an expert on them. And if he's here... then he must think that's what's in this lake.

## Is this 'spose to make me take him more serious?
It's to make you understand him, with understanding comes tolerance. Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter.

## Was that like a homo-sexual remark?
I asked you to be nice to him.

## And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.

## You like Jack?
What the guy.

## I'm just curious. I can never tell what women think is handsome. Is he handsome?
Well. He's probably rugged handsome I guess. Yeah.

## What was that?
I don't know. It was like a tug. Something tugged us.

## Hank?
Yes.

## What is she doing now.
Are you okay?

## What?
Look ten feet into the water.

## Such a simple idea and it's working. What does that tell you?
That it's about to go wrong.

## Should I?
Wait.

## I'm sure this would offend you on principal but... could we keep in touch?
I guess.

## Hi. Listen. Could I steal you a second?
Absolutely.

## The somebody else part?
Yeah, that part. There's... somebody who's um...

## A tooth?
A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear. They say it looks prehistoric. Like maybe a dinosaur.

## Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
I want you to go there.

## I. That's ridiculous.
Sorry?

## What do you expect, mugging me from behind?
I tapped you.

## Really? I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?
Well... he didn't have to tell me that part.

## You?
It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...

## Backstabber?
No.

## Liar?
Myra.

## Shitbutt?
I really... I should get back.

## Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me?
Never cock. Just squeeze.

## Thanks, Ardelia.
What'd I do?

## You missed Fourth Amendment law. Unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff. Where were you all afternoon?
Pleading with a crazy man, with come all over my face.

## Why does she keep repeating the name?
Somebody's coaching her... They're trying to make him see Catherine as a person - not just an object.

## Why not?
It would be rude. And he wouldn't get to ask any more questions...

## Not random at all, maybe. Like there's some pattern here...?
Well, except for the one girl.

## What girl?
The one that was weighted down. Where is she...? Fred something.

## Fredrica Bimmel, from Belvedere, Ohio. The first girl taken, but the third body found... Why?
Cause she didn't drift. He weighted her down.

## Where?
I'll need the big fingerprint kit... and the one-to-one Polaroid, the CU- 5, with film packs and batteries.

## How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?
I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It's not a charm school.

## Dr. Chilton - if Lecter feels you're his enemy - as you've said - then maybe I'll have more luck by myself. What do you think?
You might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time.

## Do you need a police escort, Starling? Or do you think you can find the airport by yourself?
Yes sir. I can find it by myself.

## Okay, Miss Starling?
Okay, Mr. Yow...

## You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?
That wasn't me.

## I'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you, please?
Jack Gordon.

## Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?
No. Wait... Was she a great, fat person? I may have seen her, I'm not sure...

## Mrs. Lippman had a son, maybe he could help you. I have his card somewhere. Do you mind stepping inside, while I looks for it?
Thanks.

## Are they close to catching somebody, do you think?
I think we may be, yes.

## Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?
Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.

## Did she leave any records here? Tax or business records? Maybe a list of employees?
Starling, Clarice M., good morning.

## Who's the subject?
The psychiatrist - Dr. Hannibal Lecter.

## Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad for the chance, sir, but - why me?
You're qualified and available. And frankly, I can't spare a real agent right now.

## Now. I want your full attention, Starling. Are you listening to me?
Yes sir.

## I've read your interim memo on Lecter. You sure you've left nothing out?
It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.

## Miggs has been murdered.
Well? Why aren't you there right now?

## Murdered...? How?
I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.

## Why not?
He's got a real taste for it now. And he's getting better at his work.

## Like I have a \"knack\" for Dr. Lecter?
Okay, Starling. Let's have it.

## Are you finished?
He starts this - buzzing in me, in my head. He makes me feel violated... You used me, Mr. Crawford.

## What do you see, Starling?
Well, she's not local. Her ears are pierced three times each, and she's wearing green glitter nail polish. Looks like town to me...

## But for Catherine Martin, it all comes down to you and Lecter. You're the one he talks to.
The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -

## He's already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill?
But if he knew we have so little time -

## You'll back me up with some paperwork? Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?
She doesn't know what we're up to. And we can't afford to let her find out.

## Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you?
If you didn't want me chasing him, you shouldn't have taken me to that funeral home.

## Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?
They'll use their best men. But they better be paying attention...

## Yes sir. Thank you, sir...
Where?

## What do you do when you're not detecting, Officer Starling?
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.

## Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?
Not lately. But maybe someday.

## And there's no way - no natural way - these could've wound up in the bodies?
No way. She had a guy, I'da known, believe me. Sewing was her life, she was really great at it. Poor Freddie.

## Did you ever work with her?
Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.

## Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?
I think so.

## You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?
Sometimes you do.

## That expires in one week. You're not real FBI, are you?
I'm - still in training at the Academy.

## We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?
Mmmmm... That's rather slippery of you, Officer Starling. Sit. Please.

## He said - \"I can smell your cunt.\"
Yes.

## All that detail, just from memory...?
Memory, Officer Starling, is what I have instead of view.

## How many women has he used, our Bill?
Five... so far.

## No. You ate yours.
All flayed...?

## No. I only hoped that your knowledge -
Oh, Officer Starling... do you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool?

## You're a tough one, aren't you?
Reasonably so. Yes.

## And the questionnaire...?
A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti... Fly back to school, little Starling.

## What's that, Dr. Lecter?
Your bleeding has stopped.

## Why? Do you know something about him?
I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me.

## If you didn't kill him, then who did?
Who can say...? Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere.

## Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?
Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.

## Ahhh... Why?
Because you weren't wasting my time.

## Do you have something you use, when you need to get up your courage? Memories, tableaux... scenes from your early life?
I don't know. Next time I'll have to check.

## Who killed your patient?
Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.

## Life's too slippery for books, Clarice. Typhoid and swans came from the same God. Tell me, Miss West Virginia - was she a large girl?
Yes.

## Mmm. And what else...?
She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. That hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what is means.

## A moth... How did you predict that?
I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice. Enchant me.

## Killed outright?
You're very frank, Clarice. I think - it would be quite something to know you in private life.

## Clever girl. You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that?
No. Tell me why.

## A cattle ranch?
Horses - and sheep...

## How long did you live there?
Two months.

## Why so briefly?
I - ran away...

## Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you?
No.

## Did he try to?
No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor.

## On what basis would they reject him?
The personality inventories would trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual.

## That's enough, I think. Happy hunting. Oh, and Clarice - next time you will tell me why you ran away. Shall I summarize?
Yes, Doctor. Please.

## How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you're both booted off the case?
Nobody sent me. I came on my own.

## No! That's incidental.
He kills w-

## Later, listen, I'll -
And - one morning I just - ran away...

## Not \"just,\" Clarice. What set you off? You started what time?
Early. Still dark.

## Then something woke you. What? Did you dream...? What was it?
I heard a strange sound...

## What did you do?
Got dressed without turning on the light. I went downstairs... outside...

## They were slaughtering the spring lambs?
Yes...! They were screaming.

## Where were you going?
I don't know. I had no food or water. It was very cold. I thought - if I can even save just one... but he got so heavy. So heavy...

## You still wake up sometimes, don't you? Wake up in the dark, with the lambs screaming?
Yes...

## Brave Clarice. Will you let me know if ever the lambs stop screaming?
Yes. I'll tell you.

## Well, Clarice, have the lambs stopped screaming...?
Dr. Lecter -

## Did you breast-feed her?
Yes... I did.

## Of course it counts. How do you play?
Officer Starling. Welcome back.

## I'm the one who found his perforating proboscis! Are you wearing a gun, right now? Ooh, cool! Can I see it? Can I?
Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D.

## The Latin name comes from two rivers in Hell. Your man - he drops these girls into rivers, every time. Didn't I read that?
Absolutely.

## Why didn't you bury those people?
Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...

## Your \"father\"?
Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.

## The Ottawa are gone.
He did?

## \"We're a breed apart and we make no sense\"...?
In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance...

## In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison. Why were those people living in this defenseless place...?
Sorry to disappoint you...

## Much further?
Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are downhill of it.

## What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?
Why, I am looking at you, Miss.

## They're going to hang you. Why didn't you leave when you had the chance?
Because what I am interested in is right here...

## What would you have me do?
No. I will find you.

## What is it?
I don't know. Whatever happens you stay with your father. You stay among the officers.

## Are we safe?
Maybe...

## Our father? Did you see my father?
Yes. I want you to go.

## Will you go back to England?
I have nothing to go back for.

## When? How?
Aversion? No... \"Hatred\"... \"Loathing\"...

## Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...?
Some say that's the way of it.

## \"Some\"?
Cousin Eugenie, my father, but...

## Will you consider that?
Yes. Yes, I will.

## What the bloody hell plan is this?
... compliments, Mr. Poe. Take her and get out.

## Day and a half Where did you get... the guide?
Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.

## Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on her before today.
He is Huron and nothing else. Why would he want to murder the girl?

## Of course not! And how is it you were nearby?
Came across the war party, tracked 'em.

## Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
No.

## Fort Edward, then?
No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.

## I thought all our colonial scouts were in the militia?
I ain't your \"scout\". And I am in no damn militia.

## Then you are one of those who would allow England to fight alone while she protects you from France?
I owe you gratitude or I'd call you out!

## Major! Some day I think you and I are gonna have a serious disagreement.
Who were these people?

## Head for... for the white water.
How long?

## Where do we go from here?
We don't.

## Then what?
Then we take the south rim down the mountain and it's 12 miles cross country to Fort Edward.

## And if we're unlucky?
You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin' me.

## Any powder?
Only one or two loads.

## What did you say?
I said... France is your enemy. Not ours.

## ... and while they are cooped up in your fort, what if the French send war parties to raid their homes?
You do what you want with your own scalp. Do not be tellin' us what to do with ours.

## You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject?
...No...Do not call myself much of a subject at all.

## Folks here goin' to join in that fight?
We'll see in the morning...

## You're not coming with us?
Got a reason to stay.

## That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro go free and take the fire out of the English anger over the murder of their helpless ones.

## So the Huron are the servants of the French? To do what the French are shamed to do?
Magua would use the ways of Les Francais and the Yengeese...

## What else?
A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.

## Yes, Mr. Poe? So?
It was a war party. It means they're on the attack up and down the frontier.

## What did you see, Major?
I'll have none of that! Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman. Not a butcher.

## The Crown \"negotiating\" the terms of service?
I thought British policy is 'Make the World... England', sir.

## What happened to you?
Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it. ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...

## Thank you. How can I reward you?
What a place for them...

## Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given that I've seen of the French engineering from the ridge above?
Webb's not in Albany. He marched the 33rd to Fort Edward two days ago.

## Webb's at Edward?
I understand. This is not good place to stop. Two leagues from here. No water 'til then. That where we stop. Better place.

## If Magua give women to Yengeese soldiers... will receive many gifts.
No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?

## Gifts?
Three, four oxen... much wampum.

## Wampum?
Yes.

## Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
Yes.

## For Munro children?
Yes.

## Is the hatchet buried between the English and my French father?
Yes.

## But so many suns have set since Le Renard struck the war post. Is he not tired?
That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well.

## My son Magua's pain is my pain.
And this?

## Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?
Many things my French father cannot do, Magua can.

## Their arms?
They may leave the fortress fully armed, but with no ammunition... Other than that, ask what you wish.

## The honors of war?
Granted.

## My colors?
Carry them to England to your King with pride.

## Qui vive?
France.

## Le mot d'ordre?
La victoire.

## We almost had an accident today. DeJesus' suit...
Are you planning on working tomorrow?

## You mind if I take a look at this?
Be my guest.

## What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious?
These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.

## What's wrong?
Pretty good imitation of a hangover and I ought to know.

## And?
And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...

## Why Sixpack?
It could be a million things, something in the air, food.... But he went on that ship and so did Williams... I want to examine the crew.

## They found this?
No. I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus...

## Was there such a thing?
Danakil man?...one of our ancestors. Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.

## But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
Why stop with just one aspect of marine life? Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?...

## That it acquires intelligence from its victims?
One of those chunks of Sixpack! Like a big leech, with those teeth!...

## I thought they were your friends?
Were, Doss were.

## No, it's not going through. The intercom's busted. I thought DeJesus fixed that?
He did.

## Jesus Christ...
What dead one on the ship?

## Can you fix it?
No way...

## How do you know it was Williams?
Huh? I...uh...uh...

## What?
After a month of it you'd think I'd be used to it.

## Why? You going to give me hard time like the others?
No. I'm just being friendly.

## I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps... Why are you here?
Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line. Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something.

## Well, I always heard you don't \"learn\" leadership, you earn it. How did you know they'd get into the vodka?
I guess I figured if I was in their shoes that's what I would've done.

## What can we do?
Our only chance is to lure it to the Swamp and flush it like we did the other.

## They know, don't they?
Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.

## What are you doing?
Seeing how my stock's doing...

## How much time does that give us?
Less than an hour. It's ruptured an air duct.

## He's not at his station.
Can't we fix it?

## Something wrong, Cobb?
Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...

## What's wrong with it?
...I'd really have to show it to you.

## No sir...I just wanted to know if you needed a hand?
Shut up, all of you.

## Charge set?
Charge set. Backing off. C'mon Rover let's get out of here.

## What's your air reading?
Twenty minutes...

## Twenty minutes!...Who had tank duty?
Okay.

## And it killed Bo?
No...she killed herself.

## Don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are... 'Know what I mean?
...as long as you know it's not in your contract.

## How's the weather for pickup tomorrow?
Beautiful.

## But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
I'm not anxious to find out, either.

## What're you saying? That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow?
Not yet.

## You got money in this tub?
I signed-up for the stock option.

## Cute, DeJesus...Specimen cups?
Aw, loosen up, Bowman... Hey, Willie, I got one served up for you.

## You read Russian?
Bullshit.

## What happened?
It...almost got you.

## Still bothering you?
Itches like hell.

## Yeah? How'd the kid hold up?
It's Hazy...It's got him! Stay here and don't let him out. I'm going to get the Doc.

## You guys are crazy. What the hell you play that stupid game for?
What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...

## How'd you do that?
What? That?...I've done this one before. You hungry? I'm hungry.

## Under there?
Look. Water.

## How far away is she?
Two hundred meters.

## Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
We're simply concerned about her...proximity to...

## What are you going to do to him?
I'm going to try to remove it.

## Bigger than DeJesus? How?
It's had a meal.

## What is it?
\"Debbie Does Dallas\"... Hell, it's in Russian. I can't read it...

## Who were you talking to?
Sixpack...

## How is he?
Sleeping. No sign of Doc, though. I'll check the control room. You look in the shower room...

## What's wrong?
DeJesus...It's got him.

## Fucking great...You telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us?
Cobb's cut...It was in him! It got Doc...

## What is it?
The good doctor signed our death warrant.

## What is it?
The air's stopped.

## Are you sure you saw something?
How many times I got to tell you. I saw a ship.

## Are you okay, Jonesy?
Tip top, Willie...tip top.

## Your pocket?
The latch is screwed up. Or the hinge.

## What's wrong, did you miss me?
Probably no longer than four weeks.

## A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six ... no, five days?
Well, it's still a good idea.

## How much did you part with?
Seven hundred for the pair.

## Is there something we should know about you, Soap?
I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.

## A traffic warden. Look, what's this?
I wanted to talk to you about that.

## Jesus, Tom, do they work?
Ed can run fast, talk fast, eat fast, and play cards fast, but he's fucking slow when it comes to spotting the roz.

## Yes?
It's happening tomorrow morning. Get back here now.

## I think he's still alive. He's got claret coming out of him somewhere. What did they want with a traffic warden?
I dunno, but I don't think we need him. Dump him at the lights.

## Well what?
Apart from those shotguns.

## What's that?
A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.

## Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?
You ask him if you like, but I would leave him to it if I was you.

## Like what?
Like antiques.

## Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?
You should see what they did to poor Gary.

## Where're the others?
There are no others.

## Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
I don't know what you mean.

## Inside, out-fuckin'-side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't ...
There were two old guns there; where are they?

## You heard of Harry Lonsdale? Otherwise known as Back-you-up with-a- Hatchet Harry, infamous for his removal of digits?
All right, all right, so we can say he is good.

## And JD is his dad, and owns the whole property?
No mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot ... don't worry, I got it under control.

## Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.

## So who's the Guv? Who we doing this for?
You're doing it for me is all you need to know. You only know that because you need to know.

## I see, one of those `on a need to know' basis things, like a James Bond film, is it?
Careful, remember who's giving you this job.

## Chris. You come to collect something, Chris? Should I have something for you?
Nope.

## Can I help?
I think I can help you, as it happens.

## Yes?
I have got something for ya. Well, for your boy, actually.

## The boys had 'em. I know you like these things; wondered if you wanted them?
Er, yeah, sure, I'll have 'em.

## Have you counted the money?
Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.

## They were going to pay, then?
It looks like t, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.

## Hello, John. Nice holiday?
I won't be seeing you again Chris; I have paid him every last penny.

## All right, furry muff.
Son?

## What are you doing?
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.

## How long has he been in there, son?
About twenty minutes.

## Is he on his own?
Just carrying a bag.

## Let's have a look, shall we?
It's not him, Dad.

## That should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money- loaning business, all right, son?
All right, Dad.

## Yeah?
That's no way to answer the phone.

## Is that you, Dean?
Sure is.

## What can I do for you?
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.

## OK Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right?
All right, Kenny.

## Can't you pull that stocking down further, Kenny?
It just cost me fifty quid to have this done. If you think I am going to ruin it for a couple of old bastards you're mistaken, Kenny.

## Who was that?
That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.

## So we have a bit of a problem, don't we?
Er well, yes we do.

## Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?
But... Give it us here, you dozy sod. You hide and get the guns ready. Wait until they are well in, then give it to 'em.

## So do you know these geezers well?
Well enough. I have been buying gear off one of them for a couple of years.

## What they like then?
Poofs. Nothing heavy, four public school guys. Soft as shite.

## Is there no way they can get back to you?
Even if they could they'd be too shit scared. They have got no muscle; they're gutless faggots.

## What the fuck did you do to Fauntleroy?
I didn't touch him, he just passed out.

## What the fuck is going on?
J, what's going on out there? Get the rifle out, Charles. We're being fucked.

## Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
I mean it, there is only three of us here.

## Where?
Out the back.

## And the weed?
Out the back.

## Invitations?
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.

## Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.

## Well, what do you want us to do about it?
Hit the fuckers.

## Where the fuck are they going? To butcher a sheep? I thought this was a robbery.
What was that, armed? What do you mean, armed? Armed with what?

## Where did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, Tom?
No I fucking don't! You can't make a cup of tea, Edward.

## You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
There is nowhere else to keep it, and it's the last place they are going to look. Anyway the battle's over and the war is won.

## You what? What are you on about?
Listen, if he has the guns he might have the money ... I think we should go and see him.

## Well, what's going on?
I mean it's fucking empty.

## Who's this fat man, then?
Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry.

## What do you mean?
He means they're thieving dogs.

## Top of the list of priorities, how nice they look.
What the hell are you doing here?

## Everything all right out there, Tom?
Right as rain.

## Well, what did he say?
He said he thinks we have paid him, and he wants to talk about those guns ... now.

## What do you mean, me?
Tom, this is our case.

## ... What?
This is our money, Tom! ... Now I think we should go.

## Tom?
I'll only be a minute.

## You got it all?
A hundred grand.

## You will what?
I will loan you the money.

## For half a million?
Unless you are going to accept twenty quid.

## That you, boy?
It's Ed, if that's what you mean.

## It's pay day, ain't it?
I wanted to talk to you about that.

## Yes?
I want your bar.

## Do you want me to draw a picture?
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.

## Well, perhaps you can help?
Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.

## Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?
I can't help you, Plank.

## What are you doing, Plank?
What do you think I am doing? Hold on. What are you doing? Unlock that gate. Oi! I said unlock that fucking gate.

## How much did you say it was, Tom?
You know how much it is, Nick.

## And that does include the amp?
You know it doesn't include the amp.

## Bloody hell, Tom! This is a bit heavy. This is London, not the Lebanon' Who do you think I am?
I think you're Nick the Greek.

## All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man?
Rory Breaker is standing by. You stand to make a lot of money, Tommy boy.

## At what, exactly?
My van is half full.

## So?
So I've just got to put you in, and I am off.

## Listen cooky, you want to make sure that man rests before he plays; it's in all our interests.
Get your fingers out of my soup!

## Where did you get those from, a museum?
Nick the Greek.

## Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it?
When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know.

## What about all the gear?
I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.

## There's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road. How many beaks have they got between them?
Six.

## How many wings have they got between them?
Twelve.

## How many feet?
Er, well, twelve.

## OK, don't panic; let's think about this.
That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?

## What are you carrying, Willy?
Er, fertilizer.

## What do you mean?
I mean we grow copious amounts of ganja, and you don't look like your average hort-er-fucking-culturalist, that's what I mean, Willy.

## Joanie Orozco's telling the whole school she's like desperately in love with Santo Guerra.
Who'd want to be friends with that bunch of pachuco wannabes?

## So?
It's pathetic. You can't be desperately in love when you're 14 years old.

## So?
So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.

## Save your breath. That line doesn't cut it with me.
That makes it okay?

## How do you think you're going to make a living?
I can fix cars.

## And what did she do?
Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help.

## Then how would you explain the fact that out of one hundred twenty people we tested, you're the only one who came up positive for drugs?
I-I can do the job, sir.

Follow orders. Do whatever they say.

## Who's \"they\"?
The--the officers.

## You really want to know, sir?
Please.

## How do you think I got to be a colonel?
Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. Do whatever they tell you.

## Chaos.
Because it's a job?

## Why do you think they let us in on the \"deal\"?
They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.

## Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?
No, sir. Not at all.

## Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?
No, sir. They all been real straight with me.

## Why don't you start with that?
Yes, sir.

## So you knew this young man before?
He'll live.

## Will this go on my record?
If the incident happened the way you say it did, there hasn't been an infraction.

## Did you know he was going to be there last night?
Report to Dr. Innis at the clinic.

## You're testing me?
You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.

## How's business?
Business is booming. Got your drugs, got your illegals--had a shooting the other night at Big O's--Soldier got ventilated.

## That the word on our boy?
Yeah, this is Skinny.

## Skinny?
We find a body, it's either Skinny or Stinky, depending on how much meat there is on the bones.

## You got a cause of death?
Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on.

## You uhm--you remember what old Buddy carried for a side arm?
Just wondering.

## So is Buddy on your short list?
You got to investigate. No question about it.

## What's that for?
Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. People breed like chickens.

## You do whatever I say you do or else you put it on the trail, son.
So?

## Whole different story; isn't it?
You're fired. You're outta the department.

## Do I seem jumpy?
No, you look good. I was just wondering.

## No. You?
Suppose not.

## No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you?
350 pounds.

## What?
I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter.

## Come on in.
Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?

## You've been in this house for a while?
I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.

## I'm a colonel.
Where'd he get all this?

## Yeah, I know--Man made me memorize the whole damn Army chain of command before he'd marry me. So this is a big deal, commander and all?
It's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but I moved up in rank and--well, a command is a command.

## You weren't in here tonight, were you?
No sir.

## He a Black man or an Indian?
Both.

## So they stayed in Florida?
Same as they done in Mexico.

## You know who I am?
He's still pissed off about it.

## So I'm part-Indian?
By blood you are. But blood only means what you let it.

## Big O was always there with a smile or a loan or a free drink.
Dad--?

## I have a B average.
Dad, can I talk to you about track?

## Homework?
I finished that. I'm just messing around.

## Tanks, huh?
You got to be in the Army, you might as well have something slick to drive.

## So you're going into the Army?
Not that I don't think you'd be good at it, but--you know--I wouldn't be disappointed if you decided to do something else with your life.

## You wouldn't?
No.

## How's your room shaping up?
Fine. I'm pretty much moved in.

Never thought I'd see the day a buddy of mine was dating a woman with three up and three down on her shoulder.

## You going to get married?
Maybe.

## It's a .45.
You met her family? They gonna be cool about you being a white guy?

## She's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood.
Yeah?

## So where does that put us?
Well--I don't see what's changed. No - PDA's, no necking on the obstacle course.

## You know who it was they dug up?
I was driving back from Apache Wells when they got me on the radio.

## Treasure hunter?
Old bullets. He uhm-- makes art with them.

Hobby of mine. Got some artifacts, couple pieces one of your men out at the base made. Free admission.

## That where he was shot?
That's where he fell.

Not much, jefe. Some watermelons.

## Protection?
We have a daughter.

## Never heard from him again?
I haven't been out here for a while.

## You go by your old house?
No.

## Charley? I believe he was. Used to go for lodge meetings over to Laredo. What's he got to do with your body?
All it was wearing was a big old Masonic ring and a Rio County Sheriffs badge.

## Forensics people are sure of it. You have any idea who might have put him there?
Besides my father, I mean.

## We have a murder?
Charley Wade.

## You lived in the man's house what-- seventeen, eighteen years? And you didn't get to know him any better than that?
I got to go see somebody in San Antonio today. Your memory gets any better, I'll be back tonight.

## Your mother's family is Spanish?
Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.

## How 'bout the Sheriff?
The Sheriff.

## How come you never got married again?
There must have been somebody.

## You ever play one of these?
I've seen 'em.

## You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?
I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.

Buffalo chips. Fella in Santa Fe told me he sells these as fast as the buffalo can squeeze 'em out.

## Me neither.
You think he killed anybody in Korea?

## Yeah?
You haven't paid the cab. He won't give us your bags 'til you pay him.

## How much?
Thirty-five bucks.

## doorway) And who's that?
Take a look at this.

## A Nix specialty?
Maybe they're not tricks.

## That's because he knew. He'd seen these files and knew.
I mean, there's no instructions-- What do you mean, they're not tricks?

## I'm out of here, man! Are you coming?
Thanks, Billy.

## How'd you spell that again?
D.A.M.O.U.R. D'Amour. Harry D'Amour.

## Isn't that French for something?
Right.

## Why would I do that?
Beats me.

## Who did this?
All right. It was...

## D'Amour... D'Amour... Why do I know that name?
I know him. I saw him.

## He's a priest?
No. He's just a guy who's got a nose for this shit. Like you.

## About?
Death.

## What about death?
It's an illusion.

## Anything?
Not yet.

## Jesus. Valentin. What did you do to your face?
It was me.

## Why did you wait so long?
I didn't have the skill to resurrect him. I had to teach myself. And that took time.

## And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
If he was just a man like me, then no. But he's not.

## What is he?
Maybe he'll show you.

## Do you wish him to be amongst us?
Yes...

## Will you come to him on your knees?
Yes...

## So do you. You've seen the future. Haven't you?
Yes.

## And are you afraid?
Yes.

## Did your husband know Quaid?
Yes. They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while. I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.

## You don't?
I think we make our own futures.

## What's the connection?
I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.

## Why not?
He's a secretive man.

## And you don't ask questions?
We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.

## Does that mean...?
Harry.

## When do you want me to start?
Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience. They love him.

## I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour. Tonight?
Sure.

## Are they treating you okay?
I heard what happened. It looks like somebody murdered him.

## Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
They won't tell you anything.

## How did it go today?
I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right. He didn't have a lot of fans up there.

## You didn't marry him for love.
Why? Because he had you?

## So why did you marry him?
That's my business. Harry.

## Just curious. Back to business. Ever heard of a man called Nix? Dorothea?
Yes... I'm here. And no. I don't know the name.

## What about Jennifer Desiderio?
It doesn't ring a bell. I have to go.

## Flesh is a trap. That's what he used to say. Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free. Why did you come back?
I didn't leave. I was just digging around.

## What did you find?
Jennifer Desiderio, for one. She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.

## Nix ran some kind of cult, right? Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?
It was more than that, I think.

## He was the real thing, right?
Swann said he could do stuff, yes.

## Stuff?
He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things. And he could levitate. Juggle fire.

## He taught all this to Swann?
Some or it.

## What then?
I was grateful to him. I owed him my life. And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.

## He thought Nix was coming back, didn't he?
It's okay.

## I'm here, aren't I?
Nothing's going to happen to you.

## Nothing?
Nothing you don't want.

## Are you sure?
I'm sure. He's dead.

## What was that?
It's okay.

## Harry?
It's all right. It's not hurting...

## ...yes?
Yes.

## Harry?
I'm okay. I'm okay.

## Is it finished?
I think so.

## You saw this?
Crank call. I'll get the number changed.

## No word from D'Amour?
It's better he's gone. He would have done more harm than good.

## What about me?
Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann.

## Bad show last night?
The usual. Full house. Standing ovation. I tell them it's magic...

## Yeah. Remember Quaid?
Sure.

## Sure. You want me to find out about Quaid? I mean, the funeral?
No. I'm not going near him.

## What were you doing up there?
I'm a private detective. I was hired to follow somebody for a few days. A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud.

## I got a file on him two inches thick. He's a petty fraudster. This is something else. Ever heard of someone called the Puritan?
New one on me. Okay. Let's see him.

## Where the fuck is he?
He got up and walked.

## For now. Are you planning to go back to New York?
No. Not yet...

## You believe that?
I think we walk a narrow path, between... between...

## Heaven and Hell?
Trickery and divinity.

## Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?
No. I'm saying they were always fake. The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.

## So could you walk on water?
I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.

## What about Swann's miracles?
They weren't worth a damn.

## If he was so good why's he so dead?
You tell me. No? I thought you'd maybe have a theory.

## Just tell me about Swann. Or are you too scared?
He was a freak. Everything he did was tainted.

## With what?
Evil. He was evil. Come on.

## Great accent, by the way. Is it Brooklyn?
Fuck you.

## Mr. D'Amour?
Go away.

## What are you, my mother?
I need to speak to you, Mr. D'Amour. About last night.

## Then what do you want?
I'm here to offer you a job.

## Whose is the car?
Mine.

## Havanas. You're not the smoker. So who is?
You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour. I work for the best illusionist in the world.

## You know of him?
I saw him in Vegas once.

## Are you a gambling man?
When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.

## What's the difference?
Illusions are trickery. Magicians do it for real.

## Any movie stars buried here?
Probably.

## Who is she?
Swann's wife.

## What the fuck are you doing here?
Looking for you. I tried the hotel.

## Why'd you come here?
You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief. Here's thirty thousand dollars.

## Fuck regrettable! I want to know why.
What for?

## What for? You need to stay busy?
I like to know why things happen.

## When will she be in?
I can't let you in.

## Are you satisfied now?
No.

## You rigged the illusion to fail, right?
Yes.

## You paid off the doctor. You set up the fake body. Yes?
Yes.

## Was that Swann's idea?
No. It was mine. I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after.

## Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
I want to see Swann face to face.

## I'm sorry, D'Amour...
Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over?

## What about?
... Looks like you're going... to lose... one more.

## A Mister Quaid?
Right. And he's dead, isn't he? I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know. And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.

## What's her problem?
She has no real grip on reality.

## Does anybody?
Oh yes. We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together.

## And what does Jennifer think's real?
You need an ambulance.

## Too late. Why are you here? Did you cone... up here for a reading?
My God.

## What?
You've taken some strange journeys in your life.

## The Puritan?
Yes...

## What?
That.

## Was he taking a lot of risks?
You don't know the half of it. I'm Walter Wilder, by the way.

## You know Vinovich?
Sure. Vivovich.

## For what?
For an introduction.

## Are they all in the business?
It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.

## Have you been in?
A lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you're still alive.

## How the fuck do you do that?
Now I'm going to have to kill you.

## Why? So you can fuck my wife?
You know, it's such a fucking waste. You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick.

## Oh yeah?
Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her.

## So Nix won't come looking for her?
It's me betrayed him.

## Will that do? No?
You think I'm an asshole.

## And you're not?
Oh, I was going to discover the secret of the universe. That's why I liked Nix. He promised me all these explanations.

## And he didn't have them?
He had something. He showed me how to bend the rules. A little levitation. A few fireworks.

## Did she know where Nix was buried?
No.

## Who else did? Did Valentin?
Yes.

## Jesus... what the hell's going on in there?
At a guess... they just resurrected him.

## Can you do it?
I don't know.

## You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on?
I got to go. I'm late.

## Have we met before?
No.

## What about Philip Swann?
I knew Swann. He's a fucking liar.

## Why's that?
He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn't know anything. He made us think it was over and done with.

## What is?
I don't want to think about it. If I think about it he'll hear me. He'll find me.

## Fuck you.
Swann?

## Don't touch me. He's got... got into my head.
You don't think I've got it to give?

## Swann? What are you doing?
Binding you.

## And?
You could still help me do that.

## Why would I want to?
Because you've got nothing else to live for.

## Can you get me on a flight Thursday night?
Yeah, they told me.

## These people are paying you a lot, do you think you could consider it?
Just get me out of here as soon as you can.

## Hello?
Bob, it's me.

## You'll do it?
Yeah, I'll stay.

## How long have you been married?
Two years.

## You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?
I'm thinking about it.

## 25 years... that's a long time... Are you still in love with your wife?
Oh.

## What do you do?
I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring.

## What did you study?
Philosophy.

## Oh, what do you do with that?
I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot.

## Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?
Oh, hi.

## Not really. How long are you here for?
I'm here for the week.

## Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?
Ok.

## A Soul's Search, Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this?
No.

## What do you feel like singing, Bob?
No way.

## Hello?
It's Charlotte.

## Charlotte, who?
Thanks for getting me back in one piece.

## Do you want to have some breakfast?
Yeah, I'm going to take a shower and I'll meet you downstairs.

## I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
No, its easy.

## How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?
I don't know.

## Did I scowl at you?
No, you smiled.

## Why do they switch the r's and l's here?
I don't know. My fax said \"have a good fright\".

## Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi?
No, I was looking at you.

## Oh, for her show?
No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show.

## And marriage, does that get easier?
It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.

## Did that help? Did you learn anything?
We established that we have no communication.

## Where'd you grow up?
I know.

## Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together?
Because that would be too easy.

## How old is she?
Four.

## What happened to your toe?
I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day...

## It's bad isn't it?
We should get you to the doctor.

## You think so?
Yeah, look at that thing.

## Where's your husband?
Working.

## Do you ever see him?
Yeah.

## Do you know where we are?
No.

## I'm going to Daikanyama, do you want to come walk around?
Yes, but no, I can't right now.

## You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?
No, we'll find something around here.

## What do you want to drink?
A coke.

## When are you leaving?
Tomorrow.

## Why can't it last?
I don't know, it just doesn't, reality changes things....we can't stay here forever, unless maybe we started a Jazz band.

## Charlotte?
Hi, Bob.

## I'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?
Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.

## Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?
Yes, no.

## You're leaving right now?
Yes.

## Why are you crying?
I'll miss you.

## Yes?
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.

## Do you like massage?
I don't think so.

## Yes?
Take them.

## Lydia?
Hello, darling.

## That sounds great  can you hold on... What Zoe?
Yeah, its really different here.

## Well, that's good, I have to get the kids off for school. Can I call you in a little while?
It's four in the morning... I'm going to go to sleep.

## Bob?
Hi, Lydia.

## Is this a bad time?
Uh, no.

## What are you talking about?
I don't know.

## Is there anything I can do?
I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.

## What?
You know, eat healthier.

## Alright?
Not all that pasta.

## I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, I'll talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok?
Yeah, I'll be fine. Bye.

## Hello?
Hello, Bob, it's me.

## Hello?
It's Lydia, your wife.

## Fine. Is it going ok?
Yeah.

## When are you coming home?
Tomorrow.

## Ok.
Hello?

## Do you want I send it to your room?
Great.

## Hospital?
One moment, please.

## Hello? Yes?
Hello, can I have room 5601.

## What?
Evelyn Waugh was a man.

## Why do you have to defend her?
I'm not, but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is.

## How'd it go today?
Good...I'm tired.

## You wanna come?
Sure.

## Like popcorn?
I got some hair stuff.

## Hair stuff?
I gotta go to work.

## Do you think it's done?
I don't know.

## Will you please stop smoking?
But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.

## A Soul's Search, Finding Your True Character and calling? Is this yours?
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.

## Are you sure you have to go?
Yeah, I know you have to work the whole time, I'll probably have more fun here. I'll call Charlie and those guys.

## Oh, wait, can you hold on one sec?
Sure.

## I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?
Promoting that action movie I did...

## ...doing like twenty million interviews a day... It's soo good to see you. How long are you here for?
We're here for the week. I'm shooting in Osaka for a few days.

## Do you think they have a room here?
How'd your interview go? I'm sure you charmed the hell out of Sally.

## Bad?
Weird. The book again. Sex spelled backwards...

## Uh...sure...I...what?
Sushi.

## Peter, where are you?
Sorry. It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today. Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists.

## Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
Says she can get me in to see this killer.

## Forgot my car keys. What are you doing on the fourth floor?
I spaced out.

## What happened?
Yeah, I appreciate it. Thanks, Josef.

## When did they find her?
I'm still shaking.

## You're glad somebody tried to kill me?
No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...

## There you are! My God, darling, I've been so worried. Are you alright?
Claire...

## I don't know. What are they?
I found them in your file box.

## Honey, you're exhausted. Do you want to lie down for a little while?
Frustrating. Form over content. Everything's so retro.

## ...you wearing a watch, Father?
Yes. It's exactly...

## Eight. That okay?
Yes.

## And how would you describe him?
Quiet. Real quiet...

## And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?
Seemed...on edge.

## On the day of the murders what did the defendant request?
He asked to go home early. He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.

## George, come in. What the hell happened to you?
It's nothing.

## My secretary?
You're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism.

## So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural?
Of course not. They put him through severe mental stress. Causing this aneurysm.

## Dr. Allen, could you please tell Mr. Kelson what you heard as you tried to enter Mr. Birdson's room?
I certainly hope you're not lending any credence to this.

## What did you hear?
The patient was in great distress. Naturally he was...yelling.

## And was he in distress when you opened the door? Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table?
There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.

## If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?
Maya, for the last time, I will not tolerate these obsessions.

## Is he going to be okay?
I hope so.

## You'll do it?
I don't have the experience. Father Thomas should officiate.

## You ready?
Between your book sales and this TV thing, there's going to be no living with you. And let me guess, you boiled God down to a conceit.

## What is it?
Something he said, just before...

## He spoke to you?
Yeah. It didn't make any sense.

## Listen to me, Peter. You can't let the ravings of a madman disturb you, okay?
You're right, but it's funny. All my life I thought I was simply a man who didn't believe in any of it.

## You are my son. Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you?
You killed my parents.

## Why are you doing this to me?
I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man. I really need your strength.

## So...we won?
Yes. We won, that's right.

## We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan?
Um hm. That's right, Maya.

## What's his name?
Peter...Peter Kelson.

## You just call?
I didn't know what else to do...

## Yes... and you are?
I saw you on television yesterday. You were brilliant.

## Thank you. Do you work in the building? You coming from the party?
You said that malignant narcissism was not evil.

## What if I told you I was a malignant narcissist?
A narcissist doesn't admit it. It's the extreme of self-denial.

## Last week the Catholic Church certified him as genuinely possessed. You realize how rarely they make that ruling?
I do.

## On television, you seemed so sure of yourself. If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
The world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil. Unfortunately I find it much more slippery and elusive place.

## What do you mean?
It was blank. Nothing on it. You gave me the wrong one.

## You're sure? There was nothing?
I cranked it all the way up. Nothing but hum.

## So what'd I miss?
You're right. I must've made a mistake.

## Where do you get off pretending to be my secretary?
I had to.

## Well, why should I? Alright, what's your name, where do you live, when did you kill your parents?
We need to talk.

## Last night a guy named John Townsend tried to shoot me and now I find out you knew him. What the fuck is going on?
Please, the children.

## Why did he try to kill me?
Townsend believed, just as God became man in Christ. So Satan will assume human form. I believe it too.

## And the point is?
At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man. You are that man, Peter.

## Why didn't Birdson just say so?
If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden. Unless you trick him.

## I know this sounds crazy. I understand. Check your parents' blood types. Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
My parents are dead. Don't even think of bringing them into this.

## Yes.
So what?

## Do you know your parents' blood types?
I looked at the coroner's report. My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.

## And if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me?
When Townsend tried to kill me, he said something strange like... \"The time of transformation is near...\"

## What are you looking for exactly?
Hang on, get it up, go on, higher.

## He couldn't stop us and that's how he was punished. Peter, what time were you born?
I don't know. Probably have a copy of my birth certificate...my apartment.

## What's the bible for?
Comfort.

## Are you alright?
Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions.

## What do you mean?
I'm scared I'm slipping back.

## Why did you lie to me about your parents' deaths?
I was desperate. I knew you wrote about murders. I needed a way in.

## What about after?
Only your body will remain. I believe your soul will be at peace. If we kill you, Satan can't stay.

## I don't know. Extra apartment keys. What's it matter?
Maybe I should check Lareaux's book. It's in the car. Be right back. Don't go anywhere.

## What can I do?
You have to be experienced to do this. Just wait outside. Otherwise, you risk killing him.

## How much time do we have?
Not a lot.

## Hello?
I know who he is.

## And what are you thinking we should do now?
I've filed a report with Father Frank.

## Suit yourself. But does this mean anything to you?
You do know, don't you. That these are also numbers. Greek numbers, 600, 60 and 6 - or 666. The sign of the Devil.

## What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?
He can see you Thursday.

## I plan to. You want a tip?
Lemme guess. The lottery.

## We millionaires yet?
Thanks for having me, Sally.

## Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
As if there's another cause for little voices? No, Sally, Viznick's a manipulator, he's clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism.

## What do you mean by that?
Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed.

## Are you saying he's legally sane?
Meaning, Viznick's a man who answers to no one. Not even God.

## Would you sign it for me?
Of course.

## What's this?
So you can see where you're going when you crawl up his asshole.

## What's the matter with you?
He's looking right at me.

## How're you doin' today?
It's another day. I think I'm alright.

## Parents died?
Yeah, murder-suicide.

## What happened?
Mother killed the father, then killed herself. Crime of passion.

## Where is she now?
Had to let her go. I see you thinkin' there, superstar. Don't.

## Monica, what did you do?
Nothing.

## Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?
Pants.

## What?
Nothing. So good luck.

## Monica. What are you doing here?
Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.

## Dad around?
He's still at the bank.

## What?
Whenever you lose, you get this attitude. But it's just a game.

## Need any help?
I can manage.

## How is he?
Engaged.

## Yeah, you met her?
His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.

## So what do I do?
Find out where they're registered and send them a gift.

## You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.

## So that's why we can't get along? Because I'd rather shoot a \"dumb\" jump shot?
You're the one always turning your nose up at me.

## What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?
Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.

## So you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume?
I'm angry because I want a mother, not Martha Stewart.

## What are you talking about?
When I said Quincy could do better, I was thinking about you.

## How is she alright looking the way she does?
Camille, she'll be fine.

## Which one for tomorrow?
The blue.

## You sure?
Okay.

## Are you okay?
I just need to lay down. I've been running around all day.

## So you're still breast-feeding?
The doctor said it was okay. Anyway, I'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat.

## Okay?
Well, thanks again. This was really nice of you.

## You're a caterer?
You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house.

## What?
You love to pose so much, let's see it again.

## What?
It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.

## You're cold?
No, I mean I can check it for you.

## I'm an English major. You like English?
Sort of.

## Huh?
That was two words.

## What?
I don't wanna see that.

## So how long is this trip?
Four days.

## Why not?
You might be the only one with a job.

## Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what?
To do what you love.

## That too tight?
No.

## So what's going on with the Spring Dance? You have a date yet?
Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.

## Mom tell you to do this?
No.

## Damn, Lena... Who is he?
This brother from my college.

## He's in college?
And he's fine, girl.

## How'd you get him to say yes?
I told him you looked like me.

## You ever been in love?
Too many times.

## Yeah, once I cut them off. Why?
Dad, you have to talk to Coach for me.

## And what am I supposed to say to the man?
The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.

## What?
You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited. Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality.

## Dad. What are you doing here?
I was upstairs for a meeting. I've been hearing good things about you.

## So how's the job going?
You shoot like a girl.

## Coach hates me, doesn't she?
She hates all freshmen.

## What's up with that?
Thanks, Sidra.

## What's up?
Just wanted to say good game.

## But?
No buts. Took a lot of heart to take that charge.

## What's that?
Never let a freshman take your spot.

## How do you say \"you're dreaming\" in Italian?
Can you take that damn thing off the table.

## Just like that?
Yup. So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years.

## So what are these Spanish guys like?
I wouldn't know.

## What? You've been over here seven months and you ain't tapped anything?
Just not my type, I guess.

## You ever think about going back?
One, up.

## So...does it hurt?
It's this big hole. You could almost see bone.

## For real?
Uh huh.

## So how come you could play basketball?
I just can.

## Your Dad play?
He works at a bank.

## What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?
I don't know. A lot.

## What do I have to do?
I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together. And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.

## For how long?
Five seconds.

## So?
So that means I have to ride with you.

## What?
Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.

## I know this. What do you want?
A ride home.

## What's that?
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.

## Big-ass titties?
Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me.

## Who's Spalding?
See, that's why you ain't getting recruited.

## Who said I'm not getting recruited?
Your hot-ass temper.

## Would you watch the damn road?
I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.

## You having fun?
Yeah.

## Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though. So who is this clown?
He ain't Spalding.

## Early night for you, isn't it?
I was about to ask you the same thing, going out with a college boy and all.

## So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?
None of your business.

## Why?
Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything.

## What?
You had four offensive rebounds.

## You finish the reading for E-con?
Yeah.

## What'd it say?
Basically broke down how I'm gonna make mad loot in the NBA, me being such a limited commodity and all.

## I can't be nice to a fan?
Fine, Quincy.

## So you're gonna act salty all night?
That was so weak.

## What are we playing for?
Clothes.

## What?
Give me the ball.

## Yo, where's the \"D\"?
Right here.

## I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright?
I...can't.

## Why not?
Coach has us on eleven o'clock curfew. If I'm late, I don't suit up.

## What's up?
I've been trying to find you all day.

## Who was that?
Nobody.

## You want to go talk?
Not really.

## What the hell's going on?
We're going to get some food.

## Can we talk?
Talk to your new girlfriend.

## What, \"Q-man\", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else?
You forgot to be there.

## I'm not asking for us to be together.
That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew. What was I supposed to do?

## What?
I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.

## You don't think so?
Look, I'm entering the draft.

## When did you decide all this?
Few days ago.

## So that's it, just forget about us?
Damnitt, Monica. This ain't about us anymore, it's about me.

## What are the doctors saying?
We won the championship.

## Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?
Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.

## Oh yeah?
Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American. And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again.

## What do you mean?
I'm tired of playing overseas. Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.

## Yeah. Basketball just, isn't fun anymore. You know?
No.

## You visiting?
Kyra's gone for a couple days. Figured I'd keep Mom company.

## Who's this guy I always see her around?
Darryl. He's alright, kinda corny.

## So...how's the knee?
Getting there.

## Strong enough to get you down the aisle?
Yeah. Two weeks. I didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you...

## That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
And you tore up your knee. Rehab is tough.

## Like what?
Maybe go back to school.

## Why do you keep asking me that?
Cause I don't get it.

## What?
It doesn't matter, alright. Just leave it alone.

## What's going on?
We need to talk.

## What?
From basketball.

## you woke me up to tell me that?
It's not fun for me anymore because you're missing.

## We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this?
I know, I probably should have said it two weeks ago.

## Then why are you so upset?
Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.

## Better late than never, right?
Wrong.

## What?
One game. One-on-one.

## For what?
Your heart.

## What will this prove?
You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.

## So?
So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you.

## And what happens when you lose?
If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding present.

## C'mon, girl, you live next door. Who's been creeping?
There's so many I just can't keep track.

## Well, can you give him this for me?
Give it yourself.

## With who?
Business folks.

## At one in the morning?
I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.

## Fine, then how many nights home is that?
Keep your voice down.

## What's that, not great?
The doctor'll be back in a minute.

## Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that. How you been?
Happy. And he won't want to see you.

## We still have to go?
Yeah.

## Uh, your earring?
I look like some hoochie to you? I found it on your floor.

## What are you doing in my room?
Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass girls.

## You hearing me?
I've been hearing you.

## How was your game?
Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated.

## Where's your dad?
Said he'd be home later.

## Later when?
I don't know, he had a meeting or something.

## Sorry. You okay?
I'm fine.

## Whose truth are you talking about?
Mom, we can't let something like this mess up the family.

## I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's?
Guess I should have been telling your father.

## Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word?
\"Can't\" should never be in a man's vocabulary.

## Why not?
Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.

## Yeah? So you up for a game later?
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.

## What people?
You know, people.

## What mess?
there's this thing out there. This paternity suit.

## Tell me what?
I just told you.

## I mean, it's not true, is it?
Sorry.

## So what are you gonna do?
I want this thing to go to court, but my lawyer's telling me to settle.

## What are you doing here?
I ain't a damn liar.

## So now you're saying my mother trapped you?
Since we're being honest, guess I should tell you. I'm dropping out of school and going pro.

## What?
From your mouth.

## What do you want?
Came by to check on you.

## I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget?
Yeah.

## What surery?
Oral surgery. Corrective teeth surgery.

## How are you paying tor the braces, Donnie?
I don't know.

## You ok?

No.

## I got a call of a disturbance, screaming and yelling, loud music. Has there been some screaming and yelling?
Yes. I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left. I'm sorry.

No.

## You don't have a boyfriend?
No.

## You mind if I check things back here?
It's fine.

## Claudia, Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?

About two years ago.

## You and your boyfriend have a party last night?
I don't have a boyfriend.

No, Son...be quiet...be quiet now...

## How much you pay me for my help?
I think it's more complicated than that little man.

## Why the hell aren't you in school?
No school today. My teacher got sick.

## Nope. So what'd they find out in there?
That's confidential information, little man.

## You wanna disrespect an officer of the law?
I can help you solve the case, I can tell you who did it.

## Are you a joker? huh? Tellin' jokes?
I'm a rapper.

## Whatever that meant, I'm sure it's real helpful Ice-T.
Oh, you're a rapper, huh? You got a record contract?

## Doc it's Janet.

## What happend?
Doc, go get Frank and put him on the phone.

## This sounds threatening.
Fine. Phil, you still there?

## Do you have love in your heart?
I have love all over. I even have love for you, friend.

## Well --
Well you lost me with the last couple of cocktail words spoken, m'boy, but I believe it's that sort of love. Sounds nice to me.

## What? What does that mean?
Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel.

## What?
That's right.

## Things go round 'n round, don't they?
Yes they do, they do, but I'll make my dreams come true, you see? I will.

Did you piss your fuckin' pants, Stanley?

## Cmon,cmon,cmon, that one to?
I need this one.

## Why the hell do you need all four bags of books to go to school each day?
I can't carry all of them. I need them. I need my books. I need them to go to school.

## You ready to keep winning?
Sure.

## What's the problem, what's the problem here?
I'm fine. nothing.

## And you were not hurt?
No, M'lady.

## If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
M'lady...?

## I can't bear to see you cry. What is wrong?
Nothing... Nothing.

## We haven't visited in three years. And we should have privacy.
Mother -- ?

## What is it, mother?
Next week. This is a mere garden party -- and I wish to join it, so I will be brief. I am experiencing resistance from the Jesuits.

## How can I serve you in this?
If I find out the identity of this Jesuit rebel. I will kill both him and the man who told me.

## Once a Musketeer, always a Musketeer, eh?
Your Majesty...

## How goes that favor I asked of you?
I grow closer to my target, your Majesty.

## What do you propose to do?
Making the key to the throne.

## Porthos sleeps, and you plot. Don't you think it's time you told me what it is you are plotting?
Soon enough. Here we are.

## What is that?
A body.

## I see that is a body! But where did you get it?
Excellent, Athos. You have a keen sense of this man.

## Who is he, Aramis?
Tomorrow.

## But -- what is Porthos doing?
Going into the barn naked -- or so it appears.

## But -- what is he doing?
All I noticed was that Phillippe feels even more like an animal.

## So what has changed?
Perhaps he serves a different king.

## Forgiveness?
Hell may be our destination, dear Porthos, but not this trip.

## It is also a place of burial.
Where are we?

## A tomb? We're in a tomb?
Catacombs. Very holy.

## But -- doesn't God ordain both Pope and King?
It is a weighty problem, Aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret General of the Jesuits, whoever he might be.

## And why are you so glum?
I expected action. There was no killing, no fighting, I was useless.

## I remember that night. D'Artagnan was drunk, the only time I've seen him that way. The three of us were reveling, remember, Athos?
Well... Well... Okay.

## What use am I?
We go someplace dangerous.

## So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her.
Why didn't you say so?

## Did she have tits like that?
He's going to kill you, Aramis.

## Who?
The Queen Mother. Anne.

## Who does?
Best not to ask. Shouldn't even talk about it.

## What do we do now?
I don't know about you, but I plan to wait here.

## Do I look all right?
None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.

## But -- are you sure?
Michelle cannot possibly accept!

## Piglet -- ? What are you -- ?
Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter now. She loved me once. I want to die remembering that.

## Die? What...?
I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.

## You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.

## Midnight! Mon dieu! Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
They must stay sharp. There was an attempt on the King's life today.

## Another? How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three? Four?
To kill the king.

## What is its antidote?
I suppose... it is to remember there are many people who have never been in a prison, who pass such beauty every day, and never see it.

## You look so sad. Is it something I have done?
It is something I have done -- or did not do.

## What is that?
Porthos told me.

## Whose rooms are those?
Your mother's.

## The room of the King's favorite mistress?
She will be at the ball.

## D'Artagnan...
Phillippe...?

## Are you hungry?
THE IRON MASK Just... water.

## And you never knew why?
THE IRON MASK The old man and woman called me... Phillippe.

## What is it, d'Artagnan? Assassins falling from the sky now?
The plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me.

## A personal nature?
What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me.

## You will protect me as you always have, d'Artagnan.
I just left the garden, it was empty. What did you see?

## Your Majesty...?
THE IRON MASK No, Keeper.

## THE IRON MASK What number, on the first page?
... Two-thirty-seven.

## Who was Athos seeking? Tell me! Did he try to enter the palace?
... He did -- but Captain d'Artagnan blocked his way.

## Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty?
Not by you. I will order d'Artagnan to do it.

## Now. Where is d'Artagnan?
Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.

## Aramis! I have been expecting you! We are satisfied, that will do.
Sometimes the poor do grow hungry. But why would they riot about it?

## Ah yes, the riots. We have food stocks on the wharves right now, no?
... Nothing.

## A letter. May I see?
From Raoul. He urges you to guard your honor -- as if it could be in any danger... from your king.

## The food doesn't please you?
It's lovely. It's just...

## You would do that, your Majesty?
No, you may wait behind the screen.

## Did you know... about Raoul?
I will order a Mass for his soul. It will guarantee his place in Heaven.

## What can I do for you?
Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.

## Yeah?..well what are you getting at? You saying he has an agenda down here?
That's the point. He slipped up, and he's desperate now. And that means he's all the more dangerous.

## Cooperate?
Every step of the way.

## You mind if I ride with you?
The shit just hit the fan, brother. That bitch has a partner and he got away from me.

## Where are you?
Alright, stay on the phone.

## What did the six-toes have to say?
Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.

## But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
When did you join the force? You know, the police force, the place you work...

## Did you start out area six?
Yeah...

## It's kind of a funny coincidence, isn't it?
Gotta come from somewhere...

## Where do you come from, Marvosa?
Just wondering if maybe they had a thing going with this hooker, you know, some connection.

## Are you alright?
I'll live...

## And he took a swing at you?
Yeah...the guy was psycho - I was just tying to protect the girl...

## Did he harm the girl?
Hell, he probably raped her in the lot, dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko.

## Yeah?
Her prints belong to Stephanie Field, convicted for soliciting two years ago.

## Did you read today's paper?
Could explain why Fleming was there.

## And where the hell is Marvosa?
He said he was following up some lead.

## Who is it?
I don't know - but he's from the FBI.

## So where are you from?
Up north.

## Where up north?
Seattle.

## You got any family?
No...

## Mind if I turn out the light?
No...

## You know, you don't seem afraid of much either. How do you know I'm not going to try to rape you?
Figure you would have tried it already.

## You always carry a gun with you?
No.

## What's going on here?
You'll find out - soon enough.

## Why did you set me up?
I didn't. I figured you leave it well enough alone.

## Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?
No. A witness.

## What exactly did you see?
No, but I'm listening.

## Didn't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room?
Yeah...they did. One girl...

## And what did you do?
I got out of there. I just grabbed up my stuff, and then I found it.

## Found what?
I had it all on tape...

## What happened with the tape?
I took it with me. It's in a safe place.

## Neither did I. I'll make it up to you, I promise...
Where the hell is my car?

## Tubbs, it's me.
What?

## Well where are ya, what are ya, drunk?
No...I'm in some trouble...

## Well...whatsamatter? Run in with the law?
I don't know. But I'm in trouble. I'm all over the papers. I have to figure out what's going on.

## Alright...alright...you've saved my ass enough times. What do you want to do?
I hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.

## OK...where do you want to start?
1490...Breckinridge...

## No thanks. How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
I knew I could count on you.

## I got a lot of free time, you know what I mean?
OK...county tax records...they're saying 1490 Breckinridge is owned by... an Atlantic Trust Corporation...they have a P.O. box in D.C.

## You know this time, there's nobody that's gonna cover your ass. You're over your head this time.
How about Marvosa and the others?

## What else is new?
OK...Marvosa makes calls to this fax number overseas. And that's Switzerland's country code.

## A bank?
Both at the same bank...

## It's not very much to go on...is there anything else we can check?
Shit, we just started. But I better log out of this.

## Are you going to be alright?
Don't worry about me... ...and don't forget your helmet. You don't want to get a ticket.

## Well I've kind of had my fill of the place, you know what I mean?
You must be going somewhere.

## Mind if I come along for the ride?
I'm stranded out here.

## Are you a regular there?
Are you serious? My boyfriend ditched me...

## We were fighting - I told him to let me out. So where are you headed?
Bartender said there are motels south of here.

## Where am I going?
County jail - get in.

## Long gone, huh?
I asked him not to tell me where he was going. I told him I don't want any part of it.

## What about him?
I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.

## Could he handle a direct contact?
I don't recommend it.

## Then the Tooth Fairy named the book in the part Lecktor tore out.
How are Molly and the boy?

## Right. What about sweating Lecktor?
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student. He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.

## How long do I have?
Twenty minutes max.

## When do they go to press?
Issue the toilet paper tear as a...

## Not the Bible?
No. Galatians 15,2? Galatians has only six chapters. The same with Jonah 6,8 -- Jonah has four chapters. Lecktor wasn't using a Bible.

## Where?
Library of Congress.

## This is Chester here. Who am I talking to?
Will Graham, Jack Crawford...

## Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you?
I have to.

## You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
Because it's his bad luck to be special.

## Talking about 'like,' you don't like me very much, do you?
No. I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...

## Somebody hurt him?
Typed him from semen. He's a secretor.

## Will... you saw this in the papers. The second one was all over TV. Did you ever think about givin' me a call?
No.

## Why not?
The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago...

## He's working on the single print index. What time is it?
Get him to Atlanta.

## What do you want to do?
Mrs. Leeds' fingernails and toenails. I think he took off his gloves, Jack. And dust all the corneas of all their eyes.

## Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you?
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.

## Why?
Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack.

## For Christ's sake, why?
To recover the mind set.

## Is it weird?
The mark? Yes.

## After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it. Where's Lector now?
We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler. The stuff about me and Lector? I don't know any other paper that carried it...

## Personal ads?
Twenty-five minutes. We won't make it in time.

## Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper?
Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says.

## It's your call, Will. What do we do?
Run it.

## What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
We will feel sick for a very long time.

## Who is it?
Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.

## What'd it say?
I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me, everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you.

## What's it narrow down to?
Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit.

## When are you coming back?
When I'm done.

## He's a very shy boy...
VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?

## What?
Something Lecktor said.

## That's why the boltcutter.
Will?

## What's that?
Because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed.

## You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered?
He had to.

## Is there a label on the Jacobi can that says what lab processed it?
No. It's Bob's Photo Store in...

## How far away's the back-up?
Three minutes.

## Wait for the back-up! Will?
It's happening again, Jack...

## Let's get to the physical.
...but if we find him, the print as evidence will get a conviction, Hold on. What?

## ...twenty-eight minutes. Cryptography at Langley?
They got shot a Telex. They're on if now...

## What's being photographed?
The activities of nocturnal animals.

## When do you need it?
In eight days.

## Come on in. How about a gin and tonic?
Tonic will be fine.

## How did you come to Gateway?
They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.

## Ready to tell me what kind of 'outing' this is?
It's a surprise.

## No! Don't go back into the house... It's too nice outside.
Is that you. D?

## My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too?
I have work to do at the plant.

## Do you want a Coke or something, Reba?
I'm fine, Francis.

## Francis? Where are you?
The developing room. I need to... see you.

## You'll come by?
Yes.

## Who is it?
It's me.

## Who?
Me.

## Some remarkable events have happened in Birmingham and Atlanta. Do you know what I'm talking about?
No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine.

## What am I doing here?
Atoning, Mr. Lounds.

## Do you know who I am, Mr. Lounds?
I don't want to know.

## According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said. You know now, don't you?
Yes.

## Do you feel privileged?
I'm very scared.

## Do you pray to God, Mr. Lounds?
Yes.

## Do you believe God is in attendance here, Mr. Lounds?
I don't know...

## Look at the screen. That is William Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with the Sun.' Do you see?
Yes...

## Do you see?
Yes.

## Do you see?
Yes.

## Mrs. Leeds harlequined with blood, her husband beside her. Do you see?
Yes.

## Mrs. Jacobi after her changing. The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
Yes.

## Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?
Oh, God.

## Do you see?
Please, no.

## No' what?
Not me.

## Are you a man?
Yes.

## Do you imply that I'm a queer?
God, no.

## Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
No.

## Dr. Chilton.
You'll let me go now?

## Yes?
When we were cleaning out Dr. Lector's cell, he heard us coming and hid something in a book... We got him out of there and dug around...

## Do you have it?
Yeah. It's right here.

## Put it down on my desk blotter and don't touch it again. Has anyone else handled it except you?
No.

## How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious?
Three, four hours.

## This is Will Graham. Can I help you?
No. I can help you.

## Why do you think I called?
I get a lot of calls. Most of them are from people who say they know things.

## Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you?
You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not.

## Let's get straight who we've talking about. Are you the man I'm interested in?
I don't think I'll tell you.

## He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse.
Why do you think he took his gloves off?

## What's average?
Sex murder, three. He likes to bite. Six bad ones in Mrs. Leeds. Eight in Mrs. Jacobi... ...that's all I have.

## The Commissioner was saying you were the one that caught Dr. Lecktor three years ago. He killed nine people, didn't he?
Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.

## What happened to them?
One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.

## What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.

## What would you call him?
To yourself...

## What about the dog?
It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl.

## Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it?
No.

## Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a dog?
He stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here.

## What did he want?
He asked how you are.

## And you said?
I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.

## We have it good, don't we?
All the things that happened to you before make you know that...

## What the hell can I do?
What you've already decided. You're not really asking.

## Huh? Will? Is that you?
None you'd notice. I'm lonely...

## Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff. How's Kevin?
Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing.

## To do what?
I have to see somebody.

## I'm thinking about painting the kitchen. What color do you like, Will? Are you there?
Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.

## You didn't do it to me, Will; it's happened to us. And if I survive the wallpaper we'll be okay... He's after you now, isn't he?
Good for him. Thanks a lot, Freddie! Kevin. We're going grocery shopping.

## Do you remember what you said?
Yes. I said this is too good to live...

## Can I have one of your cigarettes?
You haven't smoked in two years.

## Have you ever omitted telling me. things before?
No.

## Then why?
I wanted it over fast. It felt dirty to not tell you.

## Can you quit?
No.

## And... where are things?
Where we're at is nowhere. We have nothing. We're running out of time.

## What will you do?
I have to go back to Birmingham.

## Is Crawford going with you?
No. I have to be in there... alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.

## I was out in the garden. Mama came out and told me when she saw it on TV. Why didn't you call me?
Mama was probably asleep.

## Will? Are you okay?
Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer. I want to see you.

## What's this Mama shit?
It's what Kevin called her when he was little...

## What's the problem, Molly?
Small difference, I'm not dead, yet.

## It's Will Graham. Is Molly there, Mr. Swenson?
Sure he is. Blond. Probably Scandinavian, too...

## Yes. Is Molly there?
Tell her I called.

## Yes. Who are you?
No, I'm okay. I just wanted to... ...stop by and...

## Will it keep them out?
Yeah...

## How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.

## Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh?
Yeah, but not now... These will all make it... guaranteed.

## Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom?
No. You're very well-protected. No one can find our where you are.

## Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?
Yes.

## I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it. This guy wants to kill you?
We don't know that.

## Are you gonna kill him?
No. It's just my job to find him. I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.

## How did it happen?
Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.

## You went in the apartment?
Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him.

## Did the girl die?
No.

## She got all right?
...after a while.

## And Hobbs died?
...yes.

## You like that Colombian stuff, don't you?
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.

## Did you get my card?
I got it. Thank you.

## Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will?
No.

## And?
Very interesting, even to a layman.

## It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
It doesn't matter to me, Will.

## There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.

## Then how did you catch me, Will?
You had disadvantages.

## What disadvantage?
You're insane.

## Pictures?
Yes.

## Do you dream much, Will?
Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.

## Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
That's interesting.

## You came here to look at me, Will. To get the old scent again, didn't you?
I want your opinion.

## May I keep the file?
I haven't decided yet.

## Do you know how you caught me, Will?
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can leave messages for me at the number on the file.

## What do you want?
You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing, your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.

## I don't believe in God.
Fight what?

## Why does it feel good?
It feels good because, if you do as God does, enough times, you become as God is, powerful...

## ...if he's smart he'll approach from the front, pass, and take you from the back. How well do you hear?
Pretty well.

## Glaser Safety Slugs?
Kevlar Second Chance.

## So I understand you're from Lithuania?
No. Caspiar.

## \"No\"? \"No\" to which part?
No to the whole thing. None of it sounds good.

## Eh, hi, Andy. Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
Of course. But only on Monday nights.

## I'm here with Ed over at Taxi. There's been some trouble with Tony.
That's alright. Where...?

## Oh no! Did he get hurt?
We were just trying to push the envelope --

## Hey! Our first phone call! Hello?
Andy... it's me. I've got some crummy news. Taxi's been canceled.

## What was that all about?
It's visualization therapy. He's helping me turn inward and fight the disease.

## I don't care about the money. I just want the show to deliver.
So how can I help you...?

## So who's gonna pay for it?
Tony Clifton.

## So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?
Eh, I dunno... Andy. I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...

## What do you want? \"Take my wife, please\"?
Sure! Comedy! Make jokes about the traffic. Do impressions. Maybe a little blue material...

## Excuse me -- ?
I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant. I love this time of day.

## Oh. So you were just pretending to be an asshole.
Gosh, you scored! Look at all those goodies!

## Hi... am I late?
No, I'm sure we'll be fine.

## Popcorn?
No, I'm sure we'll be fine.

## Popcorn?
No thanks.

## Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married?
Yes.

## And all this will be for real?
I can shtop whenever I want...

## Jesus, Andy! Can they cure it?
They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.

## Have you told your family?
No, NO! Not yet. I feel bad -- I've jerked 'em around so many times.

## What?!?
Each show is worse than the next.

## What is this, World War Two...?
You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...

## Sir, do you have a problem?
Um, yes. I haven't fought with them, since I started here.

## Yes, your Holiness?
This is very difficult for me to say... but -- perhaps it would be best if you didn't attend the retreat.

## \"Philosophically\"?
Please! You've GOT to let me take the classes! It's how I keep myself BALANCED!!

## Are you sure?
Positive.

## Really?! You want Tony Clifton to headline Harrah's Tahoe?
I used to think you were original.

## Is he in his room?
Sure...

## What's your name?
Bob.

## \"Bob\"? BOB! Bob bob bob. Bob what?
Bob Gorsky.

## \"Gorsky\"? What is that, Polish?
Yes.

## Expect it. Did you get anything from the room?
Their next target. The name is Neo.

## Know what?
The sewers. Of course.

## And you are?
Smith. I am Agent Smith.

## Lieutenant?
Oh shit.

## What?
That's the third white van I've seen.

## Oh, God.
Should Tank I.D. it?

## Who is it?
It's Choi.

## You got the money?
Two grand.

## You ever have the feeling that you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?
All the time. It's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly.

## Do you?
I... it doesn't matter what I believe.

## You don't, do you?
If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.

## Are you sure this line is clean?
Yeah, 'course I'm sure.

## Don't tell me you're a believer now?
I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle? She would know.

## Cypher? Where's Tank?
He had an accident.

## What are you doing?
Midnight watch.

## Is that...?
The Matrix? Yeah.

## Why you're here?
... Yeah.

## Really?
You bet your ass. It keeps him going. Maybe it keeps all of us going.

## How many were there?
Five. Since I've been here.

## What happened to them?
Dead. All dead.

## How?
There was an accident. A fucking car accident. All of a sudden. Boom. Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.

## Are they any agent?
We found him, Trinity. We finally found him.

## What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure?
Give me your phone.

## What is he doing?
He's beginning to believe.

## How long?
Five minutes. Maybe six.

## Hello, Neo. Do you know who this is?
Morpheus...

## Who's coming for me?
Stand up and see for yourself.

## Right now?
Yes. Now.

## Good. Now there is a window. Open it.
But what if...?

## How do you know all this?
No! It's too far away.

## What do you know?
You're the One, Neo. You see, you may have spent the last few years looking for me, but I've spent most of my life looking for you.

## Do you still want to meet?
... Yes.

## I imagine, right now, you must be feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole?
You could say that.

## Ironically, this is not far from the truth. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Can you tell me, Neo, why are you here?
You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.

## Yes. Thank you. But I think we both know there's more to it than that. Do you believe in fate, Neo?
No.

## Why not?
Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.

## What truth?
The pill you took is part of a trace program. It's designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location.

## Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real?
This can't be...

## ... am I dead?
Far from it.

## What are you doing?
Your muscles have atrophied. We're rebuilding them.

## Why do my eyes hurt?
You've never used them before.

## A.I.? You mean artificial intelligence?
No! I don't believe it! It's not possible!

## For what?
Your training.

## How did I beat you?
You -- you're too fast.

## I know what you're trying to do --
Do you think my being faster, stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place?

## Because... I didn't think I would?
I thought it wasn't real.

## If you are killed in the Matrix, you die here?
The body cannot live without the mind.

## Do you understand, Neo?
I think I do.

## No you don't. Did you see the woman in the red dress?
Yeah.

## What? Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets?
No, Neo. I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.

## So is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy?
Yes. She's very old. She's been with us since the beginning.

## The beginning?
Of the Resistance.

## And she knows what? Everything?
She would say she knows enough.

## How does she know?
She is a true psychic. She sees beyond the relativity of time. For her there is no past, present or future. There is only what is.

## She helped you?
Yes.

## What did she tell you?
That I would find the One.

## What do you believe in?
That's why we're here.

## And you still believe I'm the One?
Yes I do.

## Did you believe in them too?
Morpheus, I don't know --

## How is he?
I know. You're Neo. Be right with you.

## You're the Oracle?
Yeah.

## What vase?
That vase.

## How did you know...?
You're cuter than I thought. I see why she likes you.

## Who?
Not too bright though.

## So? What do you think? You think you're the One?
But you already know what I'm going to tell you.

## What?
Your next life, maybe. Who knows. That's how these things go.

## What's funny?
Morpheus. He almost had me convinced.

## What?
Hello, Neo.

## How do you know that name?
I know a lot about you. I've been wanting to meet you for some time.

## Who are you?
My name is Trinity.

## Trinity? The Trinity? The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
That was a long time ago.

## What?
I just thought... you were a guy.

## Do you want to go somewhere and talk?
No. It's safe here and I don't have much time.

## How did you do that?
Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger. I brought you here to warn you.

## Of what?
They're watching you, Neo.

## Who is?
It's the question that brought you here. You know the question just as I did. It is a hacker's question.

## What is the Matrix?
When I asked him, he said that no one could ever be told the answer to that question. They have to see it to believe it.

## From what?
From you.

## Why?
Because you've been down there, Neo. You already know that road. You know exactly where it ends.

## What is this thing?
We think you're bugged. Try to relax.

## What?
I used to eat there... Really good noodles.

## What does that mean?
That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.

## Should I be?
No.

## Did you go to her?
Yes.

## What did she tell you?
She told me...

## Are you all right?
... right as rain.

## What did you just say?
Nothing. Just had a little deja vu.

## What happened? What did you see?
A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.

## How much like it? Was it the same cat?
It might have been. I'm not sure.

## What is it?
I don't know. It just went dead.

## What are you doing?
I'm going in after him.

## What?
I'm not the One, Trinity. The Oracle hit me with that too.

## Why?
Because...

## What?
I believe I can bring him back.

## What are you doing?
I'm coming with you.

## Do what?
You moved like they moved. I've never seen anyone move that fast.

## Are you all right?
I'm fine. Come on, we have to keep moving.

## Morning. Did you sleep?
No.

## Zion?
If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be.

## It's a city?
The last human city. The only place we got left.

## Where is it?
The Oracle.

## What are they doing to him?
They're hacking his mind.

## How?
They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems. It's like cracking a computer. All it takes is time.

## How much time?
Depends on the mind. But eventually, it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this.

## What do they want?
The Oracle. She told me this would happen. She told me...

## Why?
Because I believe in something.

## Dozer?
I don't know. I lost him.

## Isn't this Jack Groppi's place?
Yeah. But he ain't here now.

## Know where he is?
Follow me.

## What are your plans?
Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...

## It's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it?
Look fella...this is private...

## Hey! You want good stuff, or you want shit?
No.

## You got sparklers?
No, all we got is $40.

## You sure?
Riverdale.

## Well, maybe they do that in Riverdale, but down here we take cash. Now, you got it or not?
Sssh! Quiet. Y'know that's illegal.

## Well, my stuff comes from Maryland... you know what that means?
Yeah.

## And cherry bombs...ash cans...and rockets?
Ok. For another $5.00 a special on the packs.

## Why?
I gotta get the stuff.

## Can't we come with you?
Nobody sees where I get the stuff. That's good business. I'll be back in thirty minutes.

## A check? What the...hey, where you kids from?
You are with out a doubt the biggest, most pretentious bullshit thrower I know. Like to see what kind of business you'd do.

## Look who's talking. Pretentious bullshit. Who's the guy with William Blake and the tigers, eh?
No.

## Anybody wanna have a game?
Jewish...

## How do you know?
Look at her.

## Where to?
Kennedy.

## I know, I know, stupid. I mean where you goin'?
It's an open ticket. I can go anywhere up to $350.

## So?
So I'll send you a postcard from wherever. If I get there.

## Nervous?
Yeah.

## You flew before?
No.

## And say what?
I'll say that I'm travelling.

## Waddaya think?
Not quite...but keep trying.

## What happened to you Flash?
Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.

## All right, forget it. Tony, you got anything we can put on his face?
Nah.

## C'mon Tony, waddaya say?
Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie.

## I don't think I should go home looking like this. You think I could stay at your place tonight? Your mother's not there is she?
No, she isn't.

## What do you mean?
Didn't show up.

## You sick or what? You forget what we had to do to get you on the trucks, stupid?
I don't like loading crates.

## What about your attitude...Where's your job...eh? You talk and talk and I go to work...what do you do?
Ok, ok...take it easy. I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise.

## Ok, now that that's over with...what are you gonna make me for breakfast?
I won't wait until Tuesday. I'll break your arms right now.

## It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?
I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.

## How?
If you had a little talk with your uncle...if anybody can do it, he can.

## I don't get involved with anything, you understand that? Nothing! I'm clean as far as you know...right?
Yeah, take it easy. Will you relax.

## Oh, that's too bad, Teresa...
You tell me that in front of these creeps?

## Well kids...have the bans been announced yet?
Don't be smart.

## I'm not smart...I'm stupid, remember. I'm so stupid that you have to look out for me, remember?
Johnny, I swear to God, if you open your mouth about any of this...

## No you're not...
You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you?

## NO!!! What do you think I am, crazy?
No, I just want to help myself, that's all.

## What are you going to do? Hide me?
Good idea.

## Don't ask...do you have any idea what I've been doing all morning...eh?
No.

## What pipes?
What pipes...the ones from last year...those pipes.

## That bad, huh?
I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.

## I don't understand, where's Groppi?
My uncle figured that this week was bad...but about next week...I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him yourself.

## Oh great...hey - Winstons?
For these prices don't be particular. That's all they had - but next week we'll see...

## You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
Nope...

## You getting out too?
Yeah, thanks, it's ok.

## What's a'matter?
Nothin'. Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.

## How much?
$20.

## How much was the original loan again?
$500. He borrowed that because he wanted to pay off his other loans... now, counting the interest...it's almost $3,000.

## $3,000. Shit! Can we hold it at $3,000?
Charlie, this is business.

## Be seeing you and Johnny tonight... here...right?
We'll be here.

## Look, Michael, I'll get him here. What do you want me to do, kill him?
Whatever.

## Yeah, where's the rest?
You're really crazy.

## Diane, how are you feeling?
Fine.

## Stripper?
No...no stripping...as the hostess.

## Chinese food?
Ok. Chinese. We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish.

## Fine. Did you have a good time last night?
About that shooting last night...I was there and...

## You heard what happened to GROPPI, eh?
Who me? ...No, I don't know, not me...all I know is...

## Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth... ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning? Heming?
Hemmingway. Killed himself. I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.

## What did he do?
His whole family has problems...his cousin, the girl who lives next door to you...

## What do they expect you to say?
All right.

## Well, maybe you missed something?
Oh yeah, that's a possibility.

## What was it?
Nothing.

## Why don't you take a look around the place if you want?
Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times.

## Do you have enough?
Well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen...

## An apartment uptown? Downtown?
Maybe, who knows.

## Charlie...?
Nobody knows anything, believe me.

## Anything specific?
You know...like restaurants, night clubs...

## What is it now?
Don't ask.

## Did you?
No.

## A paper on that one too?
Yeah...but don't worry about that now. The Hemmingway one is first.

## No. Of course he lives there. Would I point it out to you if he didn't?
That W.A.S.P. bastard.

## Uhuh...probably a good idea. Why don't you do it this time?
You know why...with my parents.

## For God's Sakes...I told you before...nothing. Charlie, I can't stay in here too long at this hour...will you please listen to me?
I feel fine--nothing wrong with me.

## Which one, the big tab or the little tab?
Put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one.

## Will you guys shut up with the witches and tigers. Tony, you gonna close the place, we get out of here, get something to eat, or what?
We'll close up as soon as everybody leaves.

## Hey Johnny, where're you goin'?
Sal!... fourteen street.

## This is some boat. Your father's?
Yeah...just had it delivered...

## What'sa matter...forget your registration?
Of course! A double for Michael, Tony.

## You what?
Just keep him quiet.

## How much?
Not bad. $20. Here, $5.

## Can you spare it?
Sure.

## You think so?
Look who's talking.

## Did you speak to the Governor?
He's coming.

## His wife?
Unfortunately. I sat between them at the Bronx Zoo benefit -- it was better than Seconal.

## Just plain 'Joe'?
Allison, I trust you. This is your thing.

## Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart. I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.
What, honey?

## A name?
-- Black.

## Who?
From the Korean War.

## What is this?
Annie made them.

## What about the Mayor?
...This shit's not bad.

## And that?
Pinot Grigio. We're considering it for the appetizer.

## What do you do that for?
Well sir, it's 9,30 in the morning.

## Red or white?
Both.

## Oh, Mr. Parrish, I could never buy Parrish Communications. I could pay for it, of course, but it would always have your imprint.
We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?

## Yes, sir?
Hello. I'm Joe Black. Nice to meet you.

## I would say, sir, it is right up there with Jif and Skippy. But miles ahead of Peter Pan. Like a taste?
I would prefer some peanut butter.

## How would you like that, sir? On some kind of toast?
Toast? No...just the butter.

## What 'business'?
...See you tomorrow night.

## Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me. And vice versa. Okay?
No, not okay. I thought we had a good thing going here. It shows you never know.

## And what would that be?
You're taking this too far, Drew.

## Am I not obligated to?
Thank you for coming.

## What side of the industry did you say you were on?
I didn't say.

## Incidentally, Joe, where're you staying?
Here...

## Here'?
Why yes, thank you.

## \"Death and Taxes\"?
It doesn't matter.

## May I interrupting?
Yes.

## Who are we talking about?
But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.

## Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
Susan's patient is whom we are talking about.

## The dagger --?
Good morning, Drew. Thanks for coming out.

## Well, it's a big day. Wanted to line up a few ducks before kickoff. Any thoughts? Last minute refine- ments or variations?
Thoughts'? Not a one -- but I did hear a voice last night.

## A voice?
In my sleep.

## What'd it say?
Yes'.

## Yes' to the deal?
Maybe, who knows? You know how voices are. Let's go.

## ...Tomorrow we sign off -- photo opportunity, you and Big John, it'll lead network news. Okay so far?
You have a way with words.

## So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right?
As close as a deal could be.

## Sorry. I know it looks like I'm reversing my field.
Is there any more to it?

## You're not familiar with the phrase, \"In this world, nothing is certain but Death and Taxes\"?
I am now.

## No.
Shall we adjourn?

## Just kidding'?
Sit down, Drew.

## I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, Drew. Forgive me. I want you to know I value your advice.
Why?

## As much as Joe's?
You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money. Joe is just... around.

## For how long? And why?
Please. Don't worry about him. And above all, don't antagonize him.

## Mind if I throw up?
Please, Drew.

## What are their feelings?
If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer.

## What do you think the Board is going to say when I tell them that?
I don't care.

## Whose?
Yours.

## Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?
Certainly, Bill.

## Are you running this Board or am I?
I've already introduced Mr. Black to you all.

## But who is he? What are his creden- tials? What is his relationship to you?
In English, please.

## And what do I get?
You get not to go to jail.

## Never mind Bontecou. I've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and I'm putting them to see old man.
Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill. More people might --

## Are you?
We'll do it together. I'll clue you in. Timing's got to be right. The old man says it's up to Joe.

## It's up to Joe'? Those were his words?
Yeah.

## It's up to Joe', huh?
Yeah, that's what he said.

## How did Bill react to the leads you've developed?
He was interested.

## -- But he was concerned about the timing?
The timing -- yes. He says it's up to Joe.

## It's up to Joe'?
That's what he said.

## He said that?
Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.

## What you then?
I from dat nex' place.

## You wait here'n to take us? Like you bus driver to dere?
No, no. I on holiday.

## Doctor? What could be wrong wit' you?
Nuthin'.

## Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady?
Yes.

## My Doctor Lady?
Mine, too.

## You loved back?
I am.

## She knows you real self?
She knows how she feel.

## I've been buzzing you, Mr. Parrish. Are you all right?
Sure.

## Nothing?
-- And call my family, I'd like them to come over for dinner tonight.

## Didn't the family get together last night --?
Jennifer.

## Didn't you call a Board meeting?
Joe Black'. Won fifteen and lost two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952.

## Yes?
You bet. I'm king of my Rotisserie League.

## How long you here, Joe?
As long as it takes.

## Confused, huh? About what?
Love.

## You love Allison, don't you?
Oh yes, I do.

## How did you meet?
I was a world-class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl -- and for some reason she took me in.

## But she loves you?
Because there's nothing we don't know about each other and it's okay. I mean the deeper, darkest secrets -- they don't matter.

## The deepest, darkest secrets --'?
Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free.

## What do you mean 'free'?
Free to love each other. Com- pletely. Totally. No fear.

## You think so? How do you know?
Because that's the kind of man Bill Parrish is.

## Do you think I should wait to tell him 'till after the party?
No.

## What are you doing here?
I'm lost.

## Big'?
I am Joe.

## Come again?
When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.

## I'm sorry. Do you live here?
No, Joe, I'm swimming here. Then I'm going home.

## Yes --?
I'm sorry to say I know what you're saying.

## Did you know you have a wet spot on your shoulder?
Goodnight, Joe.

## Yes?
Oh goodness, no.

## Then why are you here, Joe?
I came to see you.

## Watch me do what?
I mean I appreciate that.

## Why do you love peanut butter so much?
I don't know.

## I adore things like that....food I can't do without. Don't you?
Yes...

## It comforts you, doesn't it?
Yes...I've found that it does.

## Has her pain abated?
We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.

## How long have you been standing there?
I don't like the way Drew spoken to you. But I feel better about it now because of the way you spoke back.

## Why?
Because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married.

## Girlfriend?
No.

## Gay?
No.

## Where are you going?
To bed.

## To bed'?
Yes. I'm tired.

## Why don't you get off his case?
Almost.

## Never tried, 'til now. Joe, may I kiss you?
Why, yes. Thank you.

## Yes?
Faster. And I want the scent from underneath your ears and the taste of your lips and the touch of your tongue to stay with me -- forever.

## You're here?
I am.

## Did you like making love to me?
I loved it.

## Where are you going?
Nowhere? I'm...here.

## For how long?
Oh, I hope a long, long time.

## It beats a surgical, doesn't it?
Yes. Your father and I, our time together has come to an end.

## Don't. That will come later.
Where are you going?

## What will we do?
Love will find out the way'.

## Love will find out the way'?
It's a saying.

## I believe that, don't you?
Yes, that's why I said it.

## Did I say that?
Thank you for loving me.

## You think so?
Yeah...and you're the prettier thing here.

## I didn't know her. The body I took knew her. The man she met in the coffee shop this morning. I - uh - took him.
Threw' you? Where?

## So there's nothing between you and Susan?
What a good idea.

## Thank you. Would you like the man's name?
No.

## How long have I got?
You're putting me on the spot, Bill.

## Good morning, Bill.
No --

## And what?
And I won't tell anyone who you are.

## A 'deal'?
You've got a deal.

## You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
I guess so.

## Joe --?
Yes, Bill.

## Make an exception?
There's one to every rule.

## Can you keep a secret?
Yes.

## Perhaps you would like to wait in my office --?
No.

## Would you like to sit down, Joe?
Yes.

## -- What's the deal here? Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end?
I don't understand.

## You're not thinking of going some- where, are you, Bill?
Joe, could I ask you to take a walk? Buy a tie or something. I know I'll be seeing you.

## Excellent. What is it?
Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro. A little Coleman's mustard.

## Why didn't you stop me?
Well...I don't know.

## Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?
Okay.

## Why did you go to the hospital?
I don't know.

## You were just curious?
I guess...

## About Susan?
I wouldn't put it that way.

## What way would you put it?
You tell me, Bill.

## Are you going to fire me, Bill?
Hello, Bill.

## Hello. Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?
Um -- not right now.

## What's okay?
Just a manner of speaking.

## Fish'?
Never mind. I'm tired. I'm going to take a nap.

## You're violating the laws of the universe.
Spooning'?

## This universe?
-- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.

## You are?
Yeah.

## What the hell do you care?
I was just asking, Bill.

## Say again?
I'm in love with your daughter, and I'm taking her with me tonight.

## You're what?
I think you heard me, Bill.

## Then what is it?
Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging. It's missing everything that matters.

## So that's what love is?
Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.

## With you?! Who is 'you'? Did you tell her who you are?
No.

## Does she know where she's going?
I don't like what you're saying.

## Are you threatening me?
Okay.

## Am I dreaming this? Are you a dream?
I am not a dream.

## You're not Death. You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
You're coming to 'take me'. What is that? Who the hell are you?

## You want me to be your guide --?
You fill the bill, Bill.

## I do? How long will you be staying?
You should hope quite a while.

## And then --?
This is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us.

## Excuse me? Could I say something?
Yes' is the answer to your question.

## What are you talking about?
What you were talking about.

## No, you're not. You're trying to 'handle' the situation but this is the one situation you knew you never could handle.
Are you giving me orders?

## About what?
I want to have a look around before I take you.

## Take me'...? Where?
It requires competence, wisdom, experience -- all those things they say about you in testimonials -- and you're the one.

## The one' to do what?
Show me around. Be my guide. And in return, you get...

## Get what?
Time.

## In return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, I'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that I stay interested.
What the hell are you talking about?

## Yes what?
Yes' is the answer to your ques- tion.

## Good morning, Quince.
What question?

## I'm doing great. You ready?
I am, this is it. B Day.

## How's that, Quince?
...I read you all the way on the Bontecou thing, and I know where you're coming from. And I'm with you a hundred and one percent.

## Next week?
Yeah. Or the week after.

## But he does give a shit. Don't you, Bill?
Yeah, I give a shit.

## See. There. What'd I tell you?
This one.

## It's okay, Quince. I understand. You've always meant well and I appreciate that. Sometimes things just turn out -- wrong.
The vodka. What'd I tell you?

## Come in, Joe -- I want to thank you -- okay, Bill?
Sure.

## You think Drew will go for it?
Quince, I've got confidence in you.

## Well said, Eddie. Mr. Black, shall we?
...It's not over, 'til it's over.

## I still sense some doubt in this group, we could turn it around. You'll be up in the country?
Yes, the big 'celebration' of my mandatory retirement birthday. You're an honored guest, Eddie.

## Fine, fine. Big doing up here. Why are you still down here?
No, I'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede.

## Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your cake, blow out the candles and make a wish. Talk to you Monday. Okay?
Okay, Eddie -- anyway, thanks for the memory.

## How did you know?
Drew told me.

## Does Drew tell you everything?
I hope so.

## You like him, don't you?
Yeah. I guess so.

## Not my birthday again?
You're only six-five once.

## So what's wrong with that?
That's for me. I'm talking about you. It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.

## That's all?
Be deliriously happy. Or at least leave yourself open to be.

## Daddy, what's the matter?
Nothing. I'm sorry.

## What is it, Daddy --?
Nothing.

## Are you okay?
A-Okay. Got my gloves on, my ears pricked. I'm ready for action.

## You know each other?
We've met.

## Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.

## Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
Raise away.

## What is the nature of your interest in Joe?
Nothing.

## Then what is it?
It's something.

## Where is he?
I don't know.

## I'm sorry.
Where's he going?

## But what?
Daddy --

## Oh, Dad, you're not old. You'll never be old.
I'm still here. Would you like to dance with me, Susan?

## What was that?
The fireworks are about to start.

## So you're a one-girl guy?
Damn right. Looking for her right now. Who knows? You might be her.

## How'd you know?
Me? Internal medicine.

## So if I needed a doctor, you could be it?
I could be her.

## And I want to get into my apartment and go to work. Please, what do you say, another cup of coffee?
...It's kind of a pro bono job.

## You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?
No, it was so right it scares me.

## Because I like you so much. You have coffee here every morning, don't you? If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?
Sure, I'll give you the name of a doctor. ...And I don't want to examine you.

## Why not?
It's simple, you just go to the bathroom.

## Slam it?
Just loud enough to wake me up.

## That's it?
That's it.

## Should I wear it?
No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.

## I'm sorry... um... ?
I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.

## You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them. Don't you remember?
That's the thing. I have this condition.

## Condition?
I have no memory.

## Amnesia?
My wife.

## How long have I been here?
Couple days.

## So you're holding my calls?
As requested.

## What makes you think he's my friend?
Seen you together, that's all.

## He's not my friend, Burt. But if he calls, or if he turns up here, then you give me a call in my room, okay?
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, But I've misplaced my key.

## What?
This isn't your room. You're in 304. I Fucked up.

## This isn't my room?
No, let's go.

## Then why is this my handwriting?
This was your room. You're up in 304 now.

## When was I in here?
Last week. Then I rented you another one On top of this.

## Why?
Business is slow. I told my boss about You, about your condition. He told me to Try and rent you another room.

## Leonard, it's Burt from the front desk.
So how many rooms am I checked into in this dump?

## Yeah?
I know you said you didn't want any calls...

## That's right I did, didn't I?
Yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy. He's a cop.

## Who did this to you?
You did.

## Interested in buying one?
I just want you to tell me how you came by that car.

## Do you remember me?
I don't want blood on them.

## Yeah.
Wait! Did he tell you what I was bringing?

## Is that what your little note says?
Yes.

## Tell me about her again.
You know him?

## Why?
Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.

## Deals?
It's isolated.

## Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
I wasn't helping you for money.

## They treating you alright?
Don't remember.

## Yeah. You?
Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.

## Who is he? What have you got me into?
Calm down. You're not into anything. It was my problem, you offered no help. It's got nothing to do with your investigation.

## How do I know he did that to you?
I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.

## So I just take your word?
Yes.

## What?
Kill him.

## Your wife?
She's gone and the present is trivia, which I can scribble down as notes.

## What happened?
He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.

## What do the police think?
They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.

## And what did he say?
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.

## What are you gonna do?
I'll go see him.

## And?
Give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.

## Yeah?
Yeah, I hated it.

## Me? Why would he be interested in me?
I told him about your car.

## What's wrong?
Somebody's come. Already.

## Who?
Calls himself Dodd.

## What does he want?
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.

## Help me.
Did you?

## How?
Get rid of Dodd for me.

## What?
Kill him. I'll pay you.

## What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
They're not looking for him.

## Dying.
Why not?

## What?
I remember my wife dying.

## What do you want?
I'm meeting someone called Natalie.

## Oh. But haven't we met before?
My boyfriend told me about you.

## Jimmy Grantz. Know him?
Chronic alcoholism ~ one cause of short term memory loss.

## Did Teddy send you?
I don't know. I'm sorry.

## I'm not appealing the decision.
So why did you come here?

## Mrs. Jankis, what do you want from me?
I want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds, and tell me if you really think that Sammy is faking his condition.

## How can you read that again?
It's good.

## Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building. * Why are we going there?
I don't remember.

## John Gammell?
You said you were leaving town.

## Why?
Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.

## Yeah, well I go on facts, not recommendations, okay?
Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.

## You really want to find this guy?
He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live.

## No! Should I?
I don't think so.

## Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
I might have fallen asleep before I did.

## Why?
We've got to get him out of here.

## How'd ya get him in here in the first place?
I don't know.

## So was he scared?
Yeah. I think it was your sinister mustache that got him.

## What's wrong with this one?
You like it? Let's trade.

## So what are you gonna do now?
I'm gonna ask Natalie what the fuck that was all about.

## Who the fuck are you?
Teddy. Your buddy.

## What do you mean \"bad news\"?
She's involved with these drug dealers.

## Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?
She couldn't.

## Happy now?
I won't be happy until you leave town.

## What sort of questions?
The sort of questions you should be asking yourself.

## Like how'd you get this car? That suit?
I have money.

## Don't go back in there. There's a motel out of town.
So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?

## How'd you know I was in here?
The Jaguar's out front. You didn't even Bother to put it around back.

## How do you know this?
Cos he fucking told me. He thinks it's funny. He's laughing at you.

## How do you know him?
I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town looking for information. The local boys put us in touch.

## No. Don't worry, I'm a cop. Everything'll be okay. Is he still breathing?
Maybe. Maybe just.

## Gin and Tonic. Plymouth or Boodles.
Are you sure?

## Lemon doesn't go in Gin and Tonics, darlin'. Where ya' from?
Gottingen. That's in Sweden.

## Recruit us to do what?
He is fine. And we know the jokes. When it gets vengeful, things get messy. When they get messy the wrong people die... Everybody gets it.

## Yeah?
Jos Yero changed-up the drop plan on us. He's grabbed Gina.

## Where's the new drop point...?
They'll have surveillance on us. We'll know only at the last moment...

## What do you think?
It's a rip and a hit.

## Safe house is empty... Air Support's set to jump when we know your drop point. Gina?
We're not certain...

You said Nazi Low-riders...?

## So...?

## Really? So, what is this, a party?
I thought we had to meet the Man.

## When?
Right now.

## There is one thing you can do for me in recognition of the death- defying risks we took to recover your product...
What's the recovery? How much are you looking for?

## What do you like to drink?
I'm a fiend for mojitas.

## How fast does that go?
It goes very fast.

## So where's the best place for mojitas?
Bodeguita del Medio. It's the only place for mojitas...

## Where's that?
Off a little alley with cobblestones. Hemingway went there...

## The Keys?
Havana.

## You do business in Cuba with your husband?
I never do business in Cuba. And nobody goes to Cuba but me. And he is not my husband...

## Where's she now?
She's dead...

## Later! Do you dance?
I dance...

## You know how improbable this is...?
\"Probable\"...applies to an event that may be real. Doesn't apply here.

## ...and therafore there is no consequence?
Exactly.

## And why should continuing excellence cost more?
Cost less. That's the point.

## Good samba dancing...?
Zero risk.

## Cause you don't lose loads?
Cause we guarantee every load. Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good. Your operations will, from now on, run risk-free.

## And you're our thirty-percent partner?
The range should be between fifteen and seventeen-point-five percent of the P.O.E....to even consider it.

## What if I pushed to twenty-one...?
I would say you're... ...four percentage points away from a deal...

## Why?
...to fall back on. You know, a fail-safe. Insurance.

## Do I need it?
Everybody needs it. Ask Prudential. Or Allstate.

## Really?
Sure. As far away and as fast as you can.

## When?
Whenever. Maybe later, maybe sooner.

## Would you find me...?
Of course.

## Where would I go?
Zanzibar. The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There's twelve-hundred islands there...

## And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...?
A few more moments, still in this business. Then I'd find you.

## Yero, by himself?
Maybe. Maybe with the crazy whites.

## What are you going to do with me? Are you taking me to jail? You think I will turn into your informant, is that it?
No.

## I know. And now?
Jos...

## You afraid of violence?
I am not John Wayne. There is no \"S\" on his chest. We get down if the play calls for it. But we are into business and making money.

## Red light, green light, Jos?
Client got delivery. But there were...\"extras\" in the back of the truck.

## He didn't. Interrogation's not in our skill set. So c'mon, what suspicions have you master-minded off these associations?
Here's what this is...ask how much they want to turn back to us our load...

## Packaging?
Fifty-gallon drums. Thirty-two. A hundred kilos in each. You transship that to the Malaysian boat.

## Yeah?
Hey, Captain Kirk. I think maybe I have second thoughts.

## Proof of life. How do I know Mrs. Rico's alive?
Cause she will tell you.

## What's our deal?
Backup in case the Russians get physical.

## How lucky's Miss Universe gotta be?
And there's Dmitri...

## What is it?
Alonzo...

## Stevens?
Something's wrong.

## So?
We could try to run loads into these guys. Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida. Into this group.

## What kind of weight?
Money thing is done in advance in places where there are no guns. Because when money and guns get together, there is violence...

## Anything?
Nothing.

## Where we meeting 'em...?
Port-Au-Prince.

## What do we got?
Five minutes...

## They watching us watching them watching us waiting for them? Or what?
Who knows...

## No. You gonna give me phony reassurances?
No.

## How much we looking for?
Nothing.

## Where the hell are you, man?
On my way back...

## Where'd you go?
Hit a couple of jazz clubs. Fell back to her place.

## Where?
Verdado.

## Verdado where?
It's in the suburbs outside Havana.

## ...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?
No.

## You're not makin' a move on her...?
We're makin' moves on each other.

## And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
I am asking. You to me.

## Do you believe...I have forgotten I am a cop?
I would never doubt you.

## What's your take?
What's the point? It's going down.

## Switek?
If we were for real, and knew our shit, we'd fade this one...

## Hello?
This is Agent James Fujima.

## What's your Miami PD badge number?
4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.

## How do I discuss operations over an open line?
Guy's involved in a \"meet\"...

## That's right.
\"Buy and walk\"? \"Buy and bust\"? \"Reverse undercover\"? What?

## OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders, prison gangs?
NLR, we think. I wanna know...

## How?
We don't know.

## So what do you want?
To recruit you.

## From whom...?
A Colombian producer. Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono.

## Out of...?
Haiti and Puerto Rico. Money through Dubai and Geneva maybe.

## Sonny...?
Yeah.

## Where's Riccardo?
On the phone.

## Alonzo? What are you talking about? Where are you...?
They had me from the gate.

## Goodbye.
Where are you?

## Correct. Flash samples. Flash cash.
How'd they get onto you?

## Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
White supremacist types.

## Break your encryption? Hack your e- mail? Employee databases? Somebody on the inside?
As in, your ass is dead in the water.

## Reverse undercover? WE supply to them?
They got a steady stream of supply. So, no...

## Who are you talking to?
He's talking to you, bro. What he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization...

## So?
Switek pulling this off...? That's not faith; that's delusional...

## What am I supposed to do after I get my nails and hair done...?
Reality TV and stay by the phone. That's what all wives-in-crime do...

## You okay?
Yeah.

## Nothing. Calling to say hi... What's up with you?
Bored.

## What flowers?
The bouquet, here. Five-hundred dollars worth of roses...yellow.

## ...and we're looking at Nigerian crude...
You mean with the flowers...?

## Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.

## Not French registry?
They've been targeted. And Pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now.

## Why?
I think Jos suspects anybody he doesn't intimidate. And people, who are good at what they do? They have egos, too...

## What would you do...?
Define small.

## Conveyance?
Maritime. Jose will fill you in.

## Meaning...?
They will kill you. And then they will kill your wife, too.

## And violence is extra. And expensive. So how much weight you looking to move?
Nothing. 'Cause how you do delivery on the beach, I don't like. Maybe this does not work.

## Then what were we talking to you for?
I had to lay eyes on you.

## What do I care what you think about how he looks? You wanna fuck my partner or do business?
Wait by the phone. You get a call. Or maybe you don't. Until then, piss off back to where you come from...

## It is. He try to take tonight's load?
I walk into Neptune's house...very nice. But I also see you... and our drugs that got ripped from Maguda.

## What the hell did you do?
I gotta, I gotta go...!

## What...?
Alonzo, you don't need to go home.

## You're hoping to get a look at what?
The Statue of Liberty.

## Beg pardon, ma'am?
Said, a person's gotta make a living.

## Scuse me, hon, fraid I'm only half here. Maybe you oughta run on along. But why don't you take this phone number?
You're such a doll. I hate money, don't you? God, it's been fun.

## You ain't coming to work?
Don't guess. Just come for my day's pay owing and to tell you I'm heading East.

## What you gonna do back there, East?
Lotta rich women back there...

## Yeah?
Men, they mostly faggots.

## No, ma'am, I'm not.
Ain't gonna collect your pay?

## I can tell, can't you?
Yeah, oh yeah.

## What'll we do? Leave now or what? Your place or mine? Oh God, the second I looked at you I knew. Did you?
He's got taxi fare.

## Well, that's something never happened to me before, you can bet your bottom dollar. Uh, where's the matches, ma'am?
Top drawer. Maybe if you didn't call me ma'am, things would work out better.

## Maybe we should take a little nap, see what happens?
I ain't sleepy.

## That is one hell of a shirt. I bet you paid a pretty price for it, am I right?
Oh, it ain't cheap. I mean, yeah, I'd say this was an all right shirt. Don't like to, uh, you know, have a lot of cheap stuff on my back.

## I'm a hustler, hell, didn't you know that?
I think you just put your finger on it, I do.

## Hey, listen, how about you take me to mee this Mister O'Diddle bird right now?
Tomorrow when some piece like that's scratching your back in a Fifth Avenue townhouse, where'll your pal Rizzo be? Nedicks.

## What's in your socks?
Not a cent, I swear to God, I swear on my mother's eyes.

## Smart thing for me to do is haul ass outta here.
Okay, right, right, okay. Another subject. Where you living? Still at the hotel?

## Whatsa matter now?
You don't seem like no fag...

## Well now, Ratso, I'm gonna tell you something for your own good, only first gimme a cigarette.
What's that supposed to mean?

## I ain't forcing you, like, I mean, who's forcing you?
Oh. Guess I got the wrong impression.

## I want you to stay, okay? I goddam invited you, didn't I?
I'm impressed. You're a killer.

## I been sick. Hold this, will ya?
This is an okay setup you got here, but I'd say you ain't just exactly, uh, flush, is that right or not?

## What's all this sweet talk about Florida? Your friend O'Daniel got a stable down there now?
Look at yourself, Joe, no offense, but frankly, you're beginning to smell. For a stud in this town that's a handicap.

## You ain't got a chance in hell. You need threads and glitter, baby. A front, hey?
Well, uh, my manager's gonna manage all that crap, or else he gonna get a coconut up his flue.

## Shee-it. Cough yourself inside out, then light a fag, a goddam fag. You make me puke. Where'd you steal it? In the movies?
The coat? A guy I did a favor once gave it to me. Christ.

## Forty-second Street. Where'n hell you think it come from?
You wanna know the truth? You dumb bastard, I got it for you. Look at it. Goddam thing's ten sizes too big for me.

## Can he smell the difference, eh?
Well, uh, he dam well know he ain't 'be-loved Aunt Winifred'.

## Now I'm here. I'm in New York City. Getting picked for things. Don't you see what I'm driving at?
What you're driving at, you want me to get lost so you can go to your fancy-ass party.

## You got a comb?
Don't need a comb.

## Well, if you're awright, why you hanging on the bannister. Can you walk or not?
Walk? Naturally I can walk.

## They wrong?
No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.

## But thanks. Hey, Joe, don't get sore about this or anything. You promise?
Yeah.

## And what?
I'm scared.

## Well, just exactly what the hell you think you're gonna do? Die on me?
I'm going to Florida, that's my only chance.

## You know what's wrong with you? You got fevers. You kinky as a bedbug. How you gonna get to Florida?
I'll find the money. If you just get me on the bus, that's all I ask.

## How'n hell a dumb Bronx kid like you know that?
I read it.

## If you have to shiver, why don't you pull the blanket up more?
Keep the goddam blanket on.

## Hey -- whatsa matter?
I'm wet.

## You're what?
I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.

## I'm falling apart, that's funny?
You just -- just -- what happened, you just had a little rest stop wasn't on the schedule.

## I'm zipping your fly, what the hell you think I'm doing?
Thanks, Joe.

## You want me to leave?
No, yes. No, I mean yes please go. Help me to be good. Come back tomorrow. Promise.

## Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?
Uh, yessir.

## Ready for hard work, son?
Ever stationed at Kennedy? Those Florida chicks...

## Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain, right?
You got it.

## Who's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you two are a couple -- ?
Sold. Let's go.

## Getchmis...?

## Twenty months?
Twenty fucking YEARS, man - YEARS! I figger ten at the least.

## Tunnel?
Hey! I'm getting this together man and I don't need no fucking Gastro-head along on this trip! We go through the wall.

## We go through the wall?
Don't make me laugh.

## They went out over there, must be some kind of exit.
Anybody bitten?

## To what?
Too bad you didn't have a machine.

## And what do you do when you in the catacombs?
The catacoombs? Whaddya want, a door? There's miles of em like a sewer system but they got to come up someplace in Istanbul.

## Haps, railroad, bus timetables?
Everything.

## No, don't let her! I'll... How about Peg? Robbie?
Dad... I'll pay you back for all this, I Promise.

## Where'd you get that limp?
Nothing. Just twisted my ankle.

## Where you staying, Dad?
The Hilton.

## You know where they are?
Sure.

## How far?
About ten kilometers.

## Two miles! Minefields over there. Do you know where this campground is or not?
Okay! Ley me out right here. I'm getting tired of all this bullshit from you. I'll walk it.

## Good. Now, where did you get the hashish?
A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar.

## Would you recognize him again?
Yes. I think so.

## Good. Would you go back to the Pudding Shoppe now and point him out to my men if you see him?
You decided to fly at a bad time Billy Palestinian Guerrillas all over the place blowing up planes and all.

## Just what?
I just needed some extra money. I was broke, the guy offered me the hash and...

## How much you pay this joker... this cab driver?
Two hundred dollars. It was my last two hundred.

## How much did you figure to make?
Three, four thousand...I don't know. The guy offered me the hash-- ...it just seemed like easy money.

## Got a family back there?
Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.

## What's your father do?
He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.

## Girlfriend?
...She was on the plane.

## How's it feel?
About as good as it looks.

## Feeling all right?
Yeah. That guy who beat me? I feel stoned.

## And you?
Hashish. Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish.

## What they give you?
Twelve years.

## How much did you have?
A hundred grams.

## He wasn't even in the car?
Aslan, there...

## How long?
Seven years...

## What's wrong?
Sit down a moment, Billy. I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.

## What do you mean?
The Prosecutor objected to your sentence for possession; he wanted a smuggling conviction and the High Court in Ankara reviewed it.

## And?
We've been notified that they rejected the sentence...

## What do you mean?
Get the... midnight... express.

## But how would you get into the shaft, Jimmy?
I suppose you knock three times and ask for St. Peter.

## Where is it?
I don' t know. It's someplace down in there.... ..deep.. A big door...a wheel....

## You got your stuff?
Yeah.

## What time is it?
Two thirty.

## After we're outside the kogus?
Oh we... we...

## What?
Cut his fucking throat.

## Whose?
ZIAT... What do I got to lose huh! What do I got to lose. And I'd really enjoy it.

## What?
I know where it is.

## Yeah? Where?
Hishradyo.

## Max - where?
His radio Back of his open, radio...

## What?
Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again.

## Why the suit?
Maybe he's changing jobs.

## Susan - forget it. Go get us a seat on the plane. Now.
Billy, what's the matter?

## Take it off! Take it off! ...S'il vous plait?...
What is it? ... Billy?

## Look, you don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you, right?
Was.. ...seven years old. I was on street in Suk. Buy. Sell. No family to take care. I learn.

## Learn what?
Dog eat dog, Hi-yes. You fuck other man before he fuck you. And you must fuck last.

## Lawyers?
Yeah... there's no straight lawyers in Turkey... They're all bent bent as hairpins...

## Who got the Frenchman out?
Oh Yesil... Yesil's his name but I...don't know anything... 'bout...Yesil...

## What's your name?
Jeremy...

## Okay, Jeremy...go get Dr. Chris Raymond, will you?
Internal hemorrage. 2 our of 5 have it. No definite signs of TB, but we'll quarantine them a week just to make sure.

## Did they get the sleazebag who owns this place?
There are thirty five listed in the reverend Wong's roster...

## Yeah...?
There's some weird shit here.

## Weird shit...?
Take a look.

## There's really people living down here?
Mole people. This section was pretty popular, all the way to Fulton Street...

## What?
Track bunnies. Rats. They're usually around.

## H-how do I get...?
Way we came. Take the first tunnel to your right...

## Go left. Go left again till you hit the fork... Then right again. You got that?
I think so. One right, two lefts...

## Fine. You want me to call your supervisor?
Please do. He's a lonely guy.

## For Chrissakes. You gonna lay a two- bit bureaucratic, territorial number on me?
You wanna keep up the conversation, you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude.

## Oh, that's gonna work.
20 minutes. Susan?

## Any luck?
Well...there's an old service elevator half a mile down the tracks. Ain't gonna be much use, though. Lines are dead.

## You said those cables're still live. Can't we rewire...?
Oh, man, there you go again.

## What?
Those things bring juice to the new stations. You just can't rewire that shit...

## For Chrissakes, what's the problem? You need a memo every time you fart?
Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...

## Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy. You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
I'm sorry. But I don't think letting you bleed to death is the best apology.

## \"Mistake\"? What's that supposed to...?
It doesn't matter, all right? It's dead.

## Is there a switch?
Third rail is dead. Get me up. There must be a manual override in the booth.

## Can we get this car there?
Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.

## Depends. You got a memo?
The kid...

## What are you doing down here?
Chuy. He was taken. He's down here somewhere... Oh, please, hurry. I saw what was after her.

## What are you putting that crap on me for?
You know what I mean...

## Is this a Catholic guilt thing...?
Who know? We get lucky, maybe a couple of 'em'll be ours.

## We're down to a \"couple\" now, huh?
You know where they get this fertility stuff? They extract it from the urine of menopausal Italian nuns.

## Monks bottle their own wine. Don't they?
You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that.

## We?
Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop...

## Even if they did... that's all we have, isn't it?
Metaxonycha Godmani.

## So?
Honey, just leave it.

## You give someone a fucking uniform and... Did you hear how he talked to us?
I heard how you talked to him.

## Oh, so I'm the bad guy now?
He was just doing his job.

## It's me. Can you hear me?
Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...

## Try not to sweat?
I was just thinking how I could use a pair of pliers... and I remembered where they are...

## Gross. What is it?
An \"Ootheca\". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh \"weirdbugs\" inside.

## What?
She used a baster.

## What's this?
Oh, right... They been here since noon. I told them you're real busy.

## I have no idea. Are you ready?
It bit you.

## What?
That's impossible. Insects don't...

## Guess you can tell from my reaction, I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?
I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.

## What do you want to know?
Anything you can tell me might help.

## Well, I just thought--oh, look at me. You'd think I'd never had a house guest before. Would you like something to drink?
Sure.

## How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?
Sounds good.

## Here.
How long...?

## What are they...?
They're called Novril--they're for your pain.

## Shouldn't I be in a hospital?
The blizzard was too strong. I couldn't risk trying to get you there. I tried calling, but the phone lines are down.

## Will I be able to walk?
No, it wasn't a miracle at all... in a way, I was following you.

## Following me?
Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--

## You want to read it?
If you wouldn't mind.

## What's your new book called?
I don't have a title yet.

## But what?
Nothing.

## Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to make a criticism to someone like you?
I can take it, go ahead.

## The profanity bothers you?
It has no nobility.

## The phones are working?
My daughter must be going nuts.

## Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
No. No, it isn't, it's-- --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would \"great\" be insulting?

## I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?
You'd be amazed at what some people will believe.

## Misery?
Yes. I told you I was your number- one fan.

## The Sistine Chapel?
Yeah, that and Misery's Child--those are the only two divine things ever in this world...

## Done?
Yeah, thanks.

## I DIDN'T...
You...you dirty bird. She can't be dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! How could you?

## Then who did?
No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.

## I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
Yes.

## You want me to burn my book?
Yes.

## You want me to burn my book?
I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.

## Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril. How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?
Great.

## See, isn't this nice?
Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.

## Set what up?
That's the big surprise. Your new studio--after all, writers do need a place to work.

## Misery's Return?
I know you didn't mean it when you killed her, and now you'll make it right.

## You just expect me to whip something off, that it?
I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.

## You--fooler...! Did I do good?
But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.

## Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating?
I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written.

## Paul, you're dripping with perspiration, your color is very hectic--what have you been doing?
You know goddamn well what I've been doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.

## What?
Nothing.

## Yeah, yeah...
Well, is it fair? Should I keep going?

## Will she still love him with that special perfect love?
Have to wait.

## Oh...
Not even a hint?

## I've never had meatloaf this good, what do you do to it?
My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.

## A toast?
Yes, to Misery. Let me pour you some more wine.

## Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles?
Oh, I don't know. I think so. I'll go look.

## Did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair?
Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.

## You really think so?
Absolutely. Listen, if you can't find any, it's okay. I just thought it might be nice.

## Annie, what is it?
The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.

## Why would you lose me?
The book is almost finished. Your legs are getting better. Soon you'll be able to walk. You'll be wanting to leave.

## What?
You've been out of your room.

## Why would I run away? I'm a writer, Annie--it's all I am--and I've never written this well--even you said that this is my best, didn't you?
Paul, don't you think it's time for you to start writing again? It's been over a week.

## Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me?
Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner, you make me burn my book, you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles...

## The stranger staying at the Inn, is he someone from Misery's past?
Maybe.

## Maybe. Are you ready for the next chapter?
I'm glad you like it.

## You don't know?
Dome Pear-igg-non it is.

## Four or five days ago. Why?
Virginia, when you're in this car, you're not my wife, you're my deputy.

## What? What is it?
Could be the weight of the snow.

## You really think Sheldon's out there?
Hope not--if he is, he's dead. Let's go to the newspaper office.

## Here's the list of all Sheldon's credit charges. Nothing after the Silver Creek. Any calls?
Just from his agent.

## You don't think he's dead, do you?
It was an old car--those dents could have been there forever.

## What do you expect to find? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm?
Oh, I like that tone.

## What thing?
That thing. Here it is. Right where it's supposed to be.

## What is it?
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.

## Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?
Yes.

## He's your client, huh?
Yes, he is.

## You think he might be missing?
I hate that I made this call--tell me I'm being silly.

## No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary?
So do I...

## Answer me a couple things?
If I can.

## Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?
We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.

## You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
Are you kidding? Every time that fella writes a book, she makes me set aside the first copy.

## Has she been buying any odd things lately?
Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff. --Lest you call paper odd.

## Newspapers?
No, the typing kind.

## Did they win?
Yeah. They're in the semis.

## Wasn't exactly gagging for it when she left you six months ago..The question is, do you trust her?
Well, you've thorough about it, at any rate.

## You're not scrutinizing any casual shrug for some hair-splitting nuance, are you?
Sean, please..

## Where is it?
In the envelope in my pocket. My right.. jacket..pocket..

## How grateful?
Well that depends.

## How hard you had to work to get me out of there..how in the world did you ever find me?
How I usually find you, Nyah.

## And my room?
Yeah. Naturally vain -- but they're about to close the betting table and I haven't a sou..

## Well, that's good, isn't?
Sean, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about... Isn't going to be easy for me to say.

## To do what?
Sort it all out.

## A change of plans?
Yes. We won't be able to have dinner tonight. Something's come up. I hope you don't mind.

## Feel like pleading for your life?
Not as much as you feel like hearing it.

## God damn it, Nyah! Why did you do it? Why did you save that bastard?
If it'll make you feel any better I won't do it again.

## What are you talking about?
In just a few hours you can be assured of going down in history as the typhoid Mary of Oz. G'day.

## Where?
In downtown Sydney for a start.

## And you're happy about that?
Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.

## Why, you going to make me a better offer?
Than thirty-seven million pounds? Not really.

## Not exactly. Wallis?
More like two-two point two million.

## A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?
..or hard wired..

## Not at all. But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site?
Oh well, if that's how you feel about it.

## What are you talking about?
It is, Billy.

## What manic invents disease like that in the first place? Why would he do it?
So Ambrose has Bellerophon and McCloy's got Chimera.

## There guys are walking around with different halves of the same dollar bill?
..in the building...

## That's it? That's it? That's it?
And the check's in the mall.

## How much longer before you can reach him?
Five and a half minutes. He's breached the hot zone..

## How're we doin', then?
He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.

## What can we do' mate?
Hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one.

## No. Should I?
No. You just looked as if you did.

## What if I pay the rent?
Uh-huh.

## Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
I see. You're not just another pretty face..

## Would you mind if I'm on top?
Oh, either way works for me.

## right..where is it?
Far right.

## Do what?
Indeed.

## If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?
Wanted to see how good you were. I'm hoping we might work together.

## Pull over and listen to me, will you? Just listen..
Hi. Would you mind slowing down?

## Listen to what?
I need your help and I thin you can use mine.

## Your help? What are you talking about?
Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority. I can make them go away.

## What's you name?
Ethan Hunt.

## Well, Ethan Hunt, what is it you want to talk to me about?
Awfully short notice..

## Care to wait a decent interval?
Who wants to be decent?..

## They've got a book for this?
They've got a book for everything.

## Which is?
That they're lying.

## So where did I got right?
You're not a liar. Or you're an awfully good one.. ..this thing these blokes pinched..

## Of what?
Ask a question, you get an answer!..

## What's the population of Seville any idea?
Five, six-hundred thousand.

## That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that?
Sean Ambrose, for one.

## You've either got it or you don't. Let your conscience be your guide?
Something like that.

## Someone in possession of all the facts. Are you telling me I have to do this?
Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.

## Can you think of a better one?
Not me. I was just hoping you might..or that..somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical.

## Look, would it make you feel better if I didn't want you to do this?
Much.

## What wouldn't make him suspicious?
Probably that I needed him in some urgent way..destitute - in serious trouble..the kind I couldn't possible sort out myself..

## Yes?
You'll be fine. I'm going to lose you.

## How's it going? Everything okay?
Just like old times.

## Just like old times?
Just about..

## Have you met them?
I've no doubt.

## Affirmative.
Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the London Times. What's that about?

## Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
I'll muddle through.

## Why? What's happened. What did you see?
Nyah, you've done more than enough. Even the best of snake charmers get bit.

## How do you suggest I go about it?
Easy, easy, easy, shhh!

## Are you okay?
I am now. Get me out of here. Just get me out of here.

## Ethan, you know what frightens me most when I'm with him?..the thought of never seeing you..how are we getting out of here?
Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose..

## I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?
No.

## No. Should I?
No. You just looked as if you did.

## An idea, yeah.
Why did you phrase it like that?

## If he didn't want to go anywhere without me, how did you get him on the flight?
You were there.

## When I couldn't find you, I had to replace you. Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice. He double you, what? Two, three times?
Twice.

## You know we had reservations about each other. Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that?
Not necessarily.

## Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers?
Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.

## The question is why? What was this Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying?
Right now only Ambrose knows that.

## And then what?
Then makes sure she continues to see him. Gets him confide in her and report to you.

## Aren't you even curious? About why she did it?
No. I can't afford to be curious. And neither can you, Hunt..

## Sorry, Ethan. I don't quite know where to begin. Any suggestions?
You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.

## Where is she now, by the way? Do you know?
I don't. No exactly.

## Well, Hunt, what are your plans?
Not sure. Some sort of vacation. I'll let you know where I'm going.

## He was quite a man. Did he know before the end you two had succeeded?
Yes, he knew. Just..

## ..I'm fine..and you?
I'm fine..

## Why not?
Luther..get us everything you can on the outbreak of influenza on Bruny Island last month, including photos of the victims.

## Nekhorvich's boss?
Yep.

## Left jacket pocket?
Roger that.

## Nyah still on the property?
Let's start from the inside out.

## So what did he say?
Good job. And thanks.

## It was in the bloody papers, on the telly..what's this about Gradski?
You are infected with Chimera, my friend.

## You took it! All of it! And what if I need it?
If?' My, my, my...the five hundred people on Bruny Island that you deliberately infected with Chimera needed it as well.

## Oh, please! How was I to know they had to be treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours?
That's S.O.P..

## What about him...?
Only four more cars.

## Whats Hunt doing on the TGV?
High speed train. No-one gets on. No- one gets off. High security. Good place for a pass off to Max.

## But why tell us?
Hes putting on a show, Barnes.

## Course he did. Just exactly when he knew is something of a question. Before or after I showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan?
Two minutes til Krieger shows. Thisll have to be quicker than Id like. Certainly quicker than youd like.

## Well Claire do you? Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them?
Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.

## Satisfied?
All ten million.

## Now we dont have to eliminate him? You like that, dont you Claire? Dont you?
Yes.

## Is he serious?
Always.

## Krieger can get it. Right?
We got it. On your feet.

## Are you all right Ethan. What's wrong with you?
If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.

## Oh yeah?
Sarah's reconsidering. Claire, transport in five minutes.

## Ethan -- Ethan, it's okay. It's Claire. Ethan what's wrong with you?
Don't move.

## What happened to Jim?
There was nobody on the bridge.

## What happened to Jim?
They're dead. Jim's dead.

## Where were you?
I walked away. He said abort. He was gone so I walked away.

## What are you going to do?
Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...

## Max made a deal with you?
I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.

## You're sure about this?
Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him. I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.

## May I come in?
Sure...

## What about you?
He's expecting my call. I'm going to the station... And I'm going to call him.

## What happened?
I sent the message to Max. Were on for tomorrow.

## Is this the only way?
Yes.......come here....viens pres moi...

## Two cars. Where are you?
You are my eyes. Stay with him.

## Ethan?
Claire...Hey...

## Are you damaged?
They knew we were coming. Golitsyns dead too. The disk is gone.

## Let's just bring you in safely, and then we'll worry about that, okay? Were you followed?
I dont think so.

## Dont think. Are you clean?
Yes.

## Youre in Prague?
Heard a lot about you, Hunt. Dont disappoint me.

## Who else is left?
Yes. I see your point.

## What?
Of IMF agents. At the Embassy. Tonight.

## Can I ask you something, Kittridge?
Certainly Ethan.

## What are we downloading?
Information.

## What kind?
Profitable.

## What makes you trust me?
Because if you knew what you were getting into, you never would have done it.

## Exactly, that's your job. Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open. What's the range of this thing?
It's hard to tell. I'm gonna have to be close.

## About what?
The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.

## You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and then, maybe, talk about it.

## Why don't you come back with me?
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.

## He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough. Gotta catch my flight.. So. How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
Oh man...I don't know. I'm gonna miss being disreputable.

## Who are you and what are you doing here?
I need one hundred thousand dollars.

## Really? And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you?
Why not? You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.

## On what?
Whether you like a paradox. I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

## Like Job?
Ah, but, we're asking about you.

## Why, may I ask?
That's the question I want to ask Job.

## Why should I?
It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and see if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir.

## Tell you what. How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?
Very good.

## What was your deal with Job?
Done. Bring it to me in London. I want it by the end of the week.

## How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days? It's been a delight. Now where can I drop you dear boy?
I'm not being dropped anywhere without my money.

## What about Job?
I wouldnt worry about him. Once youve got the money -- hell find you.

## What sector's the air conditioning?
Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.

## Do you want to blow the fire through the whole building?
Wait! Hold it - it's on. Let's go.

## Bank?
IMF mainframe.

## Where exactly is it?
In Langley.

## What's the matter, you don't know this trick?
Claire.

## Sorry, am I interrupting?
You wish to meet Max? This is the price of admission.

## Then what am I doing here?
Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say.

## Oh? What's the problem?
I don't know, I had to go to Chicago again. You were in Kiev. You tell me.

## Ah, God, forget it. What are we talking burnout here?
I guess.

## Why not?
Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out.

## You're going to use Walter?
He's our guy.

## Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides.

## No, not in a hurry. What do you think? You think the plot'll work?
Sure. If the main character does.

## If you were me, Ethan, who would you trust to make him believable?
Jack's pinned down Sarah. Should be a second. Keep dancing.

## Can you lose him?
No. Abort.

## Where are you?
Yeah.

## Whats going to make him do that?
What he didnt get in Prague. The NOC list.

## Jim...?
Keep counting Claire.

## No, in your...ear piece. You have a lovely smile . Can you hear me now?
Loud and clear.

## What's going on?
I don't know.

## Why don't you take a look?
Jack...that's spying.

## That's what we do isn't it?
Jack you're so wicked.

## Too wicked to have a drink later?
I think I might just take that look.

## How long until we reach the Chunnel?
Twenty minutes.

## Is something wrong with the phone? Well is something wrong with the batteries?
I always check the batteries.

## The Shawfish?
Just across the bay, at the fuel depot. The men wanted to try to get home. I can't explain.

## Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
Very good, Mr. Johnny.

## Who's dead?
Nobody. Loretta is getting married.

## Rita. Pass the wine.
You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. Do you love him, Loretta?

## Where you been?
I don't know, Rose. I don't know where I've been, and I don't know where I'm going. You should have your eyes opened for you, my friend.

## What?
I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else.

## Have I been a good wife?
Yes.

## Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great and about time. What's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married?
I don't wanna talk about it.

## Where's Ma?
Bed.

## You're not sleepy?
I can't sleep anymore. It's too much like death.

## What's your news?
I'm getting married.

## Again?
Yeah.

## What killed him?
He got hit by a bus.

## Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he here with you telling me?
He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.

## More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it?
In a month.

## He did?
Yeah.

## That don't sound like Johnny. Where's the ring?
Here.

## So you'll come to the wedding, right?
Let's go tell your Mother.

## What'd you do to your hair?
I got it done.

## And then there is copper, which is the only pipe I use. It costs money. But it costs money because it saves money.
What are you doing here?

## And what did they say?
The man understood me. The woman wanted to be cheap, but the man saw that I was right.

## Why you looking around so much?
I don't know. I got a feeling.

## Why didn't he call himself?
He's in Palermo.

## Have you come from my brother?
Yes.

## Why?
I'm going to marry him.

## You are going to marry my brother?
Yes. Do you want...

## That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
That's it.

## Loretta. What's that smell?
I'm making you a steak.

## Where'd Johnny find you?
He knew my husband who died.

## How'd he die?
Bus hit him.

## When you get engaged?
Yesterday.

## Why what?
I don't know.

## So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
No.

## When your husband get hit by the bus?
Seven years ago.

## How many men since then?
Just Johnny.

## You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey?
She was right to leave me.

## You think so?
To the bed.

## Alright. Alright. There will be nothing left.
What about Johnny?

## What?
That light.

## What? What have we done?
You ruined my life.

## What?
That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.

## What are you talking about?
Alright. Meet me at the Met.

## Alright. Where's the Met?
Hi.

## So. Where are we sitting?
Come on.

## What do you want to do now?
I wanna go home.

## How can you ask me that?
You're making me feel guilty again.

## The deal was if I came to the Opera with you you'd leave me alone forever.
He didn't come!

## Why?
I'm afraid of who I am.

## Why not?
He's coming.

## No, I'll tell him. What am I going to tell him?
What the hell are you talking about? We're engaged.

## Will you marry me.
Loretta, what are you talking about?

## Bye, Aunt Rita.
Will you marry me, Loretta Castorini Clark?

## Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
Yeah, I'll be in.

## Is there anything you want to tell us, honey?
You? No.

## No?
It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.

## What's the matter?
My scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes.

## Will you marry me?
Bobo, take the cart away.

## Yes?
You know I was married and that my husband died. But what you don't know is I think he and I had Bad Luck.

## What do you mean?
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.

## On the floor?
Yes, on the floor.

## What time is it?
Seven-thirty.

## What about the wedding?
My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married.

## How near is she to death?
A week. Two weeks. No more.

## Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?
Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.

## A month from today?
Yeah.

## Who is he?
He's my younger brother.

## We haven't spoken in five years. There was some bad blood. I want you to call him and invite him to the wedding. Will you do it?
Sure.

## How was your plane ride?
The waitresses were very nice. My mother is slipping away.

## Have you told her we're getting married?
Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.

## WHAT?
If I marry you my mother will die.

## Where's the ring?
No.

## Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him?
Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception.

## And who's gonna pay for that?
Pop.

## Will you live here?
No.

## Why not?
Pop don't like Johnny.

## How's the mother?
She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.

## Not yet. That old lady makes him sweat. Where's that card?
Hi.

## Where you been?
I don't wanna talk about it.

## Thanks. What's the matter with you?
Cosmo's cheating on me.

## What! How do you know?
A wife knows.

## What the hell happened to you?
Well. I don't really know where to start.

## No. Are you drunk?
No. But I have a hangover.

## Where's pop?
Upstairs. Johnny Cammareri showed up last night.

## Do you love him, Loretta?
Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.

## Did you see it?
No.

## You gotta date?
Hi, Loretta.

## Hi. Why ain't you at the store?
We just come from the bank.

## Then it was not a sin. But what was that second thing you said, Loretta?
I... a... slept with my fianc's brother.

## Moving in?
I came right from the airport.

## Where is she?
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.

## Maybe I should go?
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.

## Yes.
You're kidding?

## But why would a man need more than one woman?
I don't know. Maybe because he fears death.

## You don't know where Loretta is?
No idea.

## Have you come to make peace with me?
I am alone in the world.

## She was just too young for you.
Don't mind about me. But could you do me a favor and clear her place and take away all evidence of her, and bring me a big glass of vodka?

## Ouch. Too young! I just got that. You know how to hurt guy. How old are you?
None of your business.

## Are you sure?
Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that.

## What do you do?
I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U.

## That woman was a student of yours?
Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.

## There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?
Yes.

## I'll remember that. What do you do?
I'm a housewife.

## I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
Go ahead.

## Why do men chase women?
Nerves.

## May I walk with you a ways?
Sure.

## You knew that man?
Yes.

## I guess you can't invite me in?
No.

## Good night. Can I kiss you on the cheek, too?
Sure.

## You mean the whole house?
Yes.

## I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do?
He's a plumber.

## What? What?
Look.

## Is who down there?
Cosmo.

## What would he be doing down there?
I don't know.

## You got me.
Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What's got into you?

## You see that moon last night?
Burn her anyway.

## Tell me ... what do you do with witches?
Burn them.

## And what do you burn, apart from witches?
I see. Yes, of course.

## So how can we tell if she is made of wood?
Ah. Yes, of course ... um ... err ...

## Does wood sink in water?
No, no, It floats. Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her. To the pond.

## Wait. Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
Bread? No, no, no. Apples .... gravy ... very small rocks ...

## Get away!
Halt! Who goes there?

## ...What?
You've got two empty halves of coconuts and you're banging them together.

## Where did you get the coconuts?
Well, this is a temperate zone.

## Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
Not at all. They could be carried.

## What? A swallow carrying a coconut?
Well, it doesn't matter. Go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.

## Am I right?
I'm not interested.

## And ... the Grail ... The Grail is there?
There is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.

## But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...

## King of the WHO?
The Britons.

## Who are the Britons?
All of us are ... we are all Britons.

## Please, please good people. I am in haste. What knight lives in that castle?
No one live there.

## Well, who is your lord?
We don't have a lord.

## You don't vote for kings.
What?

## Well, how did you become king, then?
The same!

## Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery. May we go now?
That is a good shrubbery. I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.

## None shall pass.
What is that?

## What?
None shall pass.

## Well, what's that then?
I've had worse.

## What?
You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.

## Had enough?
You stupid bastard. You havn't got any arms left.

## Had enough ... ?
I'll have your leg.

## You'll what ... ?
Come Here.

## Hello.
What are you going to do. bleed on me?

## I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table. Whose castle is this?
This is the castle of of my master, Guy de Loimbard.

## Well ... can we come up and have a look?
Of course not! You are English pigs.

## Well, what are you then?
I'm French. Why do think I have this outrageous accent, you silly king.

## Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?
I am Arthur, King of the Britons.

## Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot, and join our number at the Round Table?
My liege, I am honored.

## What is your name?
Bedevere, my Liege.

## Who ... Who breaks out?
Er ... We ... Launcelot, Galahad, and I ... Er ... leap out of the rabbit and ...

## What with?
It's the ... oh ... it's the ... it's on the tip of my tongue ...

## What manner of man are you that can conjure up fire without flint or tinder?
I am an enchanter.

## Greetings King Arthur.
By what name are you known?

## You know my name?
I do. You seek the Holy Grail.

## What?
A G...g...g...

## A Grail?
Look, you're a busy man ...

## Too late.
How shall we find this cave, O Tim?

## Where?
There.

## Behind the rabbit?
It is the rabbit.

## What?
You got us all worked up.

## Man. I'm sorry. Old man, What knight live in that castle over there?
I'm thirty-seven.

## What?
I'm thirty-seven ... I'm not old.

## You didn't bother to find out, did you?
I've said I'm sorry about the old woman, but from the behind you looked ...

## Well?
... Well, we did do the nose.

## The nose?
And the hat. But she is a witch.

## Why do you think she is a witch?
Make a bridge out of her.

## Ah ... but can you not also make bridges out of stone?
Exactly. So... logically ...

## And therefore?
Nothing... There's your ninepence.

## You're not fooling anyone you know. Isn't there anything you could do?
I feel happy... I feel happy.

## What is your name?
My name is Sir Launcelot.

## What is your quest?
To find the Holy Grail.

## What is your favorite colour?
Blue.

## I promised I'd be at the Robinson's. They've lost nine today.
What is your name?

## When's your next round?
Thursday.

## Who's that then?
I dunno, Must be a king.

## Why?
He hasn't got shit all over him.

## Did you kill all those guards?
Yes ... I'm very sorry ...

## Camelot? Are you from Camelot?
Mm ... very nice castle, Camelot ... very good pig country....

## Do you want to come and have a drink?
Oh ... that's awfully nice.

## Oh, don't worry about that ... Tell me ... doesn't Camelot own that stretch of farmland up by the mountains?
One day, lad, all this will be yours ...

## What - the curtains?
But, Mother ...

## Rather what?
I'm ... your son ...

## How?
Well ... I'll tell you ...

## Got it?
Er ... if ... we ... er ...

## Yes?
If we ... er ...

## Oh, I remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us?
No .... keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...

## What?
Make sure he doesn't leave.

## The Prince ... ?
Yes ... make sure ...

## Where are you going?
We're coming with you.

## Well, look er, I ...
The Castle Anthrax?

## What is your name, handsome knight?
You are in great peril.

## Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?
It's too perilous.

## Oh, let me go and have a bit of peril?
No. It's unhealthy.

## They're doctors?
No look, really, this isn't nescess ...

## You've come to rescue me?
Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...

## What's he do? Nibble your bum?
Well, It's got huge ... very sharp ... it can jump a... look at the bones.

## So?
So, there are rules. Things you do and things you don't do.

## So what did Ponsonby do when she started shouting?
I think he nearly ruptured his truss.

## How much?
Seventy a year.

## How about yourself?
Sixty.

## Prince Leopold? Is he the one who bleeds all day? So what does his valet do? Wash his poultices for him?
It's better than shovelling horse shit.

## Three years, John. Is that not a bit long to be grieving?
She loved him.

## What?
You know what I mean.

## Which one of us is she flirting with?
The good-looking one.

## Aye, but will they?
John, it's not your problem what she eats.

## They said you were drunk. Why don't you tell her the truth?
It's a diary.

## What do you take me for?
You should have someone look after you.

## What's your name?
Mary Taylor, sir.

## Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?
I hope to go up next year.

## You wouldn't happen to know what the Queen's reading for recreation, would you, Mary?
Checked and locked, sir.

## Good man. And is she all right?
Yeah.

## Good. She's a good girl. Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl. And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?
Yeah.

## Are you all right, Barney?
Mr Disraeli. Ma'am.

## Have you met Mr Lyle? He's in sugar...?
I don't think I've had that pleasure.

## A situation?
I'm flattered you think so.

## I beg your pardon? Mama...?
I wish to see my mother.

## Do you know who you address, sir?
It's so infernally cold in here.

## Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?
It is quite late enough.

## By whose authority?
My own.

## How will I know what she requires?
You'll be sent a message.

## Who'll bring it to me?
Her Highness' Equerry.

## Do you?
Yes. I do.

## I beg your pardon?
I thought I made myself perfectly clear. You do not leave your room until Her Majesty requests it.

## It can wait. Anything else?
A man can refuse only so many invitations from his Queen. It was remiss of me not to come earlier.

## What do you know about the Highlands?
I am a blank sheet.

## Do you hunt?
Occasionally.

## Was there never ambition?
Maybe, once.

## Why?
To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.

## But yourself? What about John Brown?
I said. I serve the Queen.

## No other aspiration?
You will not be unaware of the threat now posed by Republicanism.

## So...?
Her mind is set. She won't change now.

## See what?
The threat. I tell them, but they don't see it.

## You are well?
I am.

## And the pony?
She's well, too.

## Then why do you persist in doing it?
Aye, ma'am.

## What?
I am told so.

## Who by?
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.

## What does he know about the Highlands?
He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.

## What is it, John? John?
I heard something.

## Must they always follow us?
I ordered it. It's for your own safety.

## Am I not safe enough with you, John?
Aye. But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.

## Yes, ma'am?
I was told you were in a fight.

## Has someone seen to those bruises?
Yes, ma'am.

## Yes?
I do not accept.

## What can we do?
Oh, several things.

## Is that not enough?
In so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave. A figurehead.

## I stay here because I am happy. Is that such a terrible crime?
No, ma'am.

## The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
Well, both.

## My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion.
The question is, do we need her?

## So?
We'll see which way the wind blows.

## What did he want?
To know when he'll be king.

## Who?
Mrs Brown.

## What's her excuse this time?
The Princess Louisa is too ill to move. Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity. You're smiling.

## We think she can be dissuaded. Have you had a glance at the diary?
Yes.

## Where did you find it by the way?
Some young page was boasting about having seen it. Lucky.

## The same, your Majesty.
Whom?

## Why was I not informed?
I did not consider it wise, in the circumstances, to tax your nerves.

## How ill is he?
The Royal Family and senior members of the household, ma'am.

## Just them?
Yes, ma'am.

## What is he doing there?
He appears to be ... standing by his horse.

## I made no request to go out riding today. How long has he been there?
I don't know, ma'am. He was observed earlier, I believe.

## Well?
Mr Brown is unable to attend today.

## Why?
I believe he is unwell, ma'am.

## Unwell?
I understand he was in a fight.

## Has he been hurt?
I believe not, ma'am. I understand -- he'd had rather too much to drink.

## How long has he been this sick?
A few days, ma'am.

## Why was I not told earlier?
Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the courtyard. I have no wish to go riding.

## Why?
He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.

## Who told them that?
I have no idea.

## Why not?
I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself.

## What is it?
I have a letter, ma'am.

## From whom?
From Princess Helena and other members of your family.

## What do they want?
They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.

## Ma'am?
Ma'am.

## Where is my son?
Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.

## Why is he not here?
He is sick, ma'am.

## Then why are you not with him?
You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.

## What is the matter with him?
He has typhoid fever, ma'am.

## What do you mean?
It's a tough game. Hard to pin that bastard down. Keeps on changing the rules.

## What's the riddle?
If I tell you, then it's no fun.

## Could you play ARCADE with that?
Well, technically \"yes\", but this is only the prototype.

## Thanks, Albert. Think you could print up those schematics?
Sure.

## What's the question mark?
Level Ten. That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.

## Dead?
Well, brain-dead anyway. Coma patient. It's really not all that important.

## He?
The donor. Maybe he's alive inside the game.

## How'd you know it was us?
Security camera. Pulled your files before I came down. Be careful what you say, kids ... I know where you live.

## Now what seems to be the problem?
It's the game, ARCADE.

## You don't like it?
If this is a joke, I'm not laughing.

## Has anyone seen Greg?
He's probably outside. You know how he is. Gets bored...

## Sick?
Everybody's sick, huh? It's fifteen after. We always meet here, you know that.

## Did you play ARCADE last night?
Actually, no. I was just telling Nick, here, that my t.v.'s busted...

## Liar. Did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right?
I came from the city on the left.

## Hmmm. He said you were going to have dinner?
Yeah...

## Hello?
Hey, kid.

## What the hell are you talking about?
I have to talk to you.

## What do you mean by \"weird\"?
Greg never came home. A few hours is one thing, Nick, but this is different. Something's happened to him.

## Can you turn off the game?
No. Look, I know you're not going to believe me, but listen anyway... I think the game's alive somehow.

## So how did it know my name, then?
You imagined it.

## All of them?
Because I didn't know where else to go.

## It's not this weird. It'll make sense. Everything gets weird this late anyway, right?
Sure.

## Well?
She thought Benz was at school.

## Where to now?
Laurie's.

## This is like a movie or something. I mean, am I paranoid or what?
My house. I want to try something.

## What?
It's not just the cable system. It's in the phone system as well, the electronic net. It's everywhere.

## Like the fractals?
It's growing. Getting stronger. Maybe it's only localized now...

## What?
You mean we learn the rules...

## Virgin sacrifices?
Drives 'em crazy every time.

## What are you going to do?
Everything.

## What are you looking for?
A way to hook this helmet into the game. I'm sure there are interfaces...

## What?
I don't want anything to happen to you. I care about you.

## Okay. Give us a kiss?
One. In case...

## Which way do you think Level Two is?
I don't want to talk about it.

## I just thought of something. If we came back from the game... ...what if ARCADE did too?
I know.

## And then keep on driving?
Sure. Never come back. Disappear forever.

## So how did you do it, Alex?
Well, it's a long story...

## Then we'll go home?
Then we'll go home.

## Which way?
That way.

## I miss you so much, Alex. I want so much to be with you...
What did he do to you?

## I love you, Alex. I never wanted to leave. You know that, don't you?
Yes...but...how did you...

## Is...is that where we are? Did I die?
Not yet, honey...

## \"Escape\"?
In case things get too intense. It automatically freezes the game, gives you a breather. Things can get pretty wild...

## So how do I start?
The game will guide you.

## So what do you think?
Sign me up.

## Can you say anything but \"cool\"?
Of course I can. I can say all sorts of things...

## I am the Truth Teller. Where should I take you?
So start at the beginning...

## What's going on, Cynthia?
They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.

## What did you say?
They fired everyone.

## What do you mean \"you know\"?
Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls.

## But I'm not broke.
And?

## I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
Beverly Hills Hotel. I've got enough cash in my pocket for one night.

## The Cowboy?
Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.

## Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the Cowboy. Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters?
Something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening, Adam, and I think you should do it and I think you should do it right away.

## Cynthia...what's going on?
It's been a very strange day.

## And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?
Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.

## Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?
I'll call him, then call you back...If you want you could stay at my place.

## So what's the problem?
There is no problem.

## Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?
Whatever.

## A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. Is that somethin' you agree with?
Sure.

## What did I say?
That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.

## Well, just stop for a little second and think about it. Will ya do that for me?
Okay, I'm thinking.

## There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
One.

## Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?
I understand.

## So, this is the last time I see you then unless I do bad?
No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again.

## Yes...what is it?
I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.

## ... What?
The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us.

## How... how'd they know I was here?
I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.

## So, what did they say?
Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.

## Unbelievable. Look... here. I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?
That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.

## It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?
His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever.

## I understand. I saw the dress. I...I'm sorry. Are you all right?
A car ... a car accident.

## Are you okay?
I think so. I was just taking a shower.

## Betty Elms?
Yes.

## Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?
No, no, I'm fine.

## I want to play this one close, Bob. Like it was with that girl, what's her name, with the black hair. That felt good. Whaddya think?
Betty.

## You're still here?
I came back. I thought that's what you wanted.

## Before what?
Yes, there was.

## Can you tell me what happened?
No. I can't.

## Diane?
Number 17.

## What is it Rita?
I'm...I'm... oh no... I thought when I woke up... I thought sleep would do it ...

## How do you remember how to talk?
I don't know.

## You don't remember anything else?
No There is something...something there I can't tell... I can't describe it. There are things there.... but I'm... here.

## The money. You don't know where it came from?
Unh, unh.

## When you think about them... the money... the key ... does it make you remember anything?
Mulholland Drive.

## Mulholland Drive?
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.

## There's nothing?
Not that I can see.

## What's wrong with that?
I'm all right.

## To my audition.
Is everything all right? Is it bad for you that I'm here?

## And who are we auditioning for today?
Wally Brown.

## And do we know which of the fifty-seven buildings Wally Brown is in?
No, we don't.

## Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?
Yes, Sir.

## Yeah, what for?
Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all.

## What's the matter now?
Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this.

## Why did you want to go to breakfast if you're not hungry?
I just wanted to come here.

## To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?
This Denny's.

## Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.
Okay. Why this Denny's?

## So, you came to see if he's out there?
To get rid of this god-awful feeling.

## MCKNIGHT You feel it?
DOMGAARD Yeah.

## MCKNIGHT Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?
DOMGAARD No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.

## MCKNIGHT The one of 'em still alive?
DOMGAARD Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You remember Dr.Scott.

## MCKNIGHT Find out who they are?
DOMGAARD Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.

## MCKNIGHT Where at?
DOMGAARD Palmdale.

## Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?
Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff for this guy.

## Not a coke or anything?
No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.

## A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
No...

## You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?
Sure.

## So many tubes to get in, only one is the way out.
Where's the dock ?

## Jesus, my legs are asleep. I'll never be able to win this shit.
Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?

## Is that it ?
Yeah, I'd say that's it.

## Good morning. What do you have today ?
I have an embezzler and his accomplice.

## What's going on ?
Please don't be alarmed, Ma'am.

## Where are we ?
No time. Get him up.

## Why should we trust you ?
I made this place..... now listen to me. I'll get out of this room, we have bigger troubles than this....

## What about Matt ?
You're both embezzling. I saw the records.

## Now where do we go ?
I don't know.

## How do we get out of this room ?
We wait. This is an elevator.

## Now what the hell are we supposed to do ?
We have to climb up that.

## So where does this lead ?
No where. We've got about seven minutes before this thing slams into a concrete wall.

## So what do we do ?
I'm working on it.

## Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this place ?
It's called Murderland. It's paid for by First Bank.

## First Bank ? But how ?
It's a tax write off for John C. McCay.

## McCay knows ?
Knows ? He watches every \"Guest\" on tape. This whole place is here for his sick amusement. And no so are we.

## What are you doing ?
NO ! I wouldn't do that.

## Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
Why would he ? His parents are rich.

## What's the trick here ?
We drown.

## Obviously, but what's the way out ?
Once the room depletes it's oxygen, we have about 30 seconds, then a door opens on the bottom over there. Then we swim out.

## How long till the room fills ?
I'd say about thirty to forty minutes. Give or take a few.

## Do you have something better to talk about ?
I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.

## But how do you know if the people are guilty ?
I do a very thorough background check. I go through police files, personel files, anything.

## There are other things too. They had everyone start taking those psych tests. Did they make you take one ?
Yeah, everyone has to when they get hired.

## What do you do with the company, if I might ask ?
I... I .....

## Know what ? That it was your fault ?
It wasn't my fault. I was just part of a team. I was doing my job...

## You okay ?
Fine...

## Okay Mr Inventor, how do we avoid it ?
You don't. It's random, there no trick.

## Where are we going ?
The Brooklyn Bridge.

## Do you know where you're going ?
Yes.

## What was that ?
Girder, watch your head.

## What about you ?
There's one more person here for me to visit.

## I work here, remember ?
That was eleven years ago.

## Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.

## Who are you anyway ? What the hell is this ?
Just shut the fuck up.

## Okay, NOW I'm worried. What exactly is on the other side of the door ?
Either you'll be shot with bullets, impaled with a large spike, or nailed like a super model. Basically you're fucked any way you go.

## I don't help criminals.
And that's different than this because...... ?

## Is it over ?
Not quite....

## What's next Walt ?
A dragon.

## So what happened ? Did you have a real bad theme park experience as a kid and this is your revenge ?
Be very, very quiet...

## Are you hunting wabbits ?
The room has sound sensors. If you wake it up, it breathes fire.

## An elevator ?
Yeah, we're about a hundred an fifty feet below the subway stations. We're heading a little higher up now.

## Why don't you tell us a little about yourself ?
Look pipsqueak, I'm having a real bad day here and we're just starting.

## You okay ?
Ow...

## This probably isn't the bet time, but I really have to pee. Can I pee ?
Knock yourself out.

## Is it over ?
Almost. Look, you two get out of here.

## Where ?
In the jail cell is a spiral staircase. It leads to the surface. Take it all the way up.

## What ?
Don't eat at the console.

## What ? Are you my mother ?
It's my control board and I don't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard, no put the shit away.

## Here. Am I ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers ?
When I think you're ready.

## When will that be ?
When you are ready.

## I've been working with you for four years, don't you think that's worthy of at least one turn at the controls ?
No.

## And who bailed you out when a hit was put on you, you sorry sack of shit. Who put you up ? Who gave you a job ?
You did.

## What's wrong ?
I just want to double check the facts.

## So ?
He already had a balance of $600,000.

## Any priors ? Any police record ?
Checking..... Hah ! He has a shit load of unpaid parking tickets...

## Parking tickets ? That's it ?
Yeah, but we're talking 43.

## A real criminal.... I still think that's our in... What about her ?
Checking........

## You think I'm that easy, Bitch ?
For once in your life, shut the fuck up.

## Well ?
MCCAY Fire the whole division.

## Excuse me, sir ?
Sir, I came from the Chicago offices myself, and if I may say, sir, there are still some very good....

## MCCAY If you want, I can fire you and have someone else who has the balls terminate these worthless people. Which will it be ?
We will start work on it now sir.

## I thought that was Darwin, sir. Or perhaps Nietzsche ?
Yes sir, I do. Last night's, fresh from the Park.

## Thank you , sir. Sir, may I ask you a question ?
MCCAY Of course.

## MCCAY Zach, how old are you, son ?
I am thirty two.

## MCCAY And how much do we pay you annually ?
I make roughly four hundred thousand a year.

## MCCAY What about that time when the mail room kid was accused of stealing and we put him in the \"Park\" ? Wasn't that a computer glitch ?
Bruce may still refuse. It is my belief that he is becoming more belligerent.

## MCCAY I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.
What do you mean sir ?

## What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
MCCAY Do you think the assistant, what's his name...

## MCCAY Yes, do you think he would like a raise and a new position ?
Sir, this is not like firing any employee. We can't predict what will happen.

## MCCAY Zach, my boy ! How is tonights adventure going ?
Good, sir.

## MCCAY Is it as good as I hope it is ?
Better, sir.

## Sir ?
Yes sir. It will be the best of your collection, I assure you.

## We have new \"guests\" for the park. I have a file on them. May I see Bruce ?
He's been expecting you.

## What did you hear ?
I was.

## Might I ask why you no longer work for the mob ?
There was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs.

## What are you looking for ? A blow job ?
No. I am not a homosexual.

## Then what do you want ?
Have you ever considered running your own \"Park\" ? I mean, since you will not be returning to your former profession.

## Are you happy with your salary and position ?
No I am not.

## So who are these people with the Boss ?
Just a temp who pissed me off and a girl who turned me down for the night of her life.

## How long till the drug wears off ?
We should have another fifteen minutes at least.

## What is Bruce doing ?
I don't know.....

## He'll never make it out of the park alive. I promise you that....
What was that ?

## Will he make it out ?
Of course, this one's a gimme. Just be patient, even Ol' Bruce can't outwit some of these traps.

## I'll see that bet.
What's next ?

## Aren't you going to switch exits on him again ?
Why ? The crocks are all going for the dead crock. There's no fun in it. Besides we've got plenty more for them. The night is young....

## Was that the Old Man ?
The room will fill to the top, then if they wind up in the next room, they lived, if not, they're dead.

## What happened ?
The power went out in half the park.

## How can this happen ?
I don't know. I think that a power grid just needs reset. Don't get your panties in a bunch. I'll go down and reset it.

## I meant him.
Go in there ? What if Bruce finds you ?

## Listen, I was thinking, you know. Would you go, it's I think you're...
Just look at this tie. You could fry an egg off that orange, yow. Have you ever considered the Jerry Garcia line of ties ?

## It's sounds so much better when you say it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's important that I ask. Will you go out with me ?
Yes.

## Really ? On a date ?
Yes.

## Dinner at my place then ? Say, seven o'clock ?
Sure.

## Thank you, won't you come in ?
Thanks.

## Are you okay ?
Yes, Excuse me for a second.

## Like what, a Porsche ? A Ferrari ?
Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.

## No ! Just get up. This is serious.
My own sit down Star Wars arcade game. Wanna play it ?

## What the hell kind of cop are you ?
I think we should follow him...

## Are you okay ?
Fine, fine, I feel like a chicken McNugget.

## We just having our first date when you showed up.
The roof is coming down.... hey, you.... Which door gets us out of here ?

## I think I'm very quickly getting over my phobia of public urination.
How's your foot ?

## What ?
Nothing.

## Are you okay ? Any holes ? I mean aside from the one's that nature gave you ?
I want to go to sleep for about a month.

## Ow. Son of a ..... Did I ever tell you my theory on Star Wars as Porn ?
No.

## I am equally impressed with your knowledge of the market. How long have you been with the company now ?
Four years. I came over from the Capitol merger in Chicago six months ago.

## Umm, where do you want this?
Oh, just put it over there.

## Do you still teach?
No, no, no, I gave it up ten years ago...actually it gave me up.

## How did you know my name?
Your Uncle Phil told me.

## Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
This is California, anything is possible.

## What kind of sleazoid geek would turn her in?
I would do it again in a minute.

## What about living in the real world pal?
Give us a break. All you have to do is make a phone call.

## What do you remember about her.
So charge him with something...who's gonna know?

## She was the uhh...first girl ever suspended for smoking.
Wow, you walked out with my mother?

## Suspended from school, my mother?
Everyone was really surprised when Maggie was turned in, she got kicked out for two weeks.

## His name is Jeffrey Pommeroy and he used to drive a 54 Ford pickup, black with red interior. Please?
Yeah, this is Sergeant Tanaka from Holenbeck, I need a current address for a Jeffrey....

## Do you wanna be a hall monitor all your life?
Hello, I'm gonna need this right now...this guy...well we think he might be going after the governor. Twenty minutes? Fine.

## You want me to move?
Well not far, just down the hall. Plus Grammoo's room's a lot bigger, and you get a view of the whole neighborhood.

## Visualize a spare?
Well you know what I mean.

## Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.

## Seriously?
Seriously.

## What boy likes you?
It's just a question, it's not about anybody.

## So you're saying...What are you saying?
Well, I kinda just blurted it out over a root beer float.

## You were just having a fight about me. Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?
Of course.

## What?
No nuns, got it.

## What does that mean?
Bye Dad, I'll miss you.

## Totally groovy huh?
Totally.

## I will. How's Shelly?
Okay...bye daddy, I love you.

## What happened to Shelly?
She just had a baby that's all.

## We have a baby?
Uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother.

## Can I see him?
You can do anything you want. You're his sister.

## Oh, Shell, that's ridiculous, where are my needle nosed pliers?
Well if there was an article about it I'm sure she did. She was always reading.

## Yes I know, it runs in the family. New book?
Never heard of him.

## How about a nice glass of milk?
And some taco chips so I can dunk.

## I told you about the pumpkin didn't I?
No.

## Reason? What reason?
Phil's moving to LA, Grammoo's passing, the baby being born, Vada's report, I think...

## Maybe he's wet?
Maybe he's hungry.

## Maggie Muldovan? Did you...know her?
It's okay really, I was just a baby.

## What're you saying?
Ummmmm, look, I...I...

## Are you saying my mother had another husband?
Oh honey, back then...people did crazy things.

## Sure am, who are you?
I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...

## Umm...can you come in for a minute?
I'd like to, thanks.

## Does she?
I'm glad you're here.

## You are?
Yeah, come on, let's talk.

## I told you it was a long story.
I told you it was a long story.

## Special effects?
I don't know very much about her...I was hoping that you could help me.

## Do you have any pictures if her?
I've got something better.

## Would you like...eh...to have these movies?
More than anything in the world.

## Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.

## Wait...woah...woah...wait a minute...Do you think I'm your father?
Well...

## What are you staring at?
It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.

## What's the matter?
He likes you.

## Hi.
That's ridiculous, so, if you really can't stand someone, then you pretend that you're really crazy about them?

## Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow?
ehh...I don't know I mean....

## Then what did she do?
Well...I'm not supposed to talk about it, but since I'm gonna write about it I might as well tell you. She was a spy against the Russians.

## So she had you in jail, in Russia?
Well actually I was born in Siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my Dad.

## Is it okay if I drink this?
It's okay with me, hi Kevin.

## You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?
No-one invented gravity, it just exists.

## All right, so when did she have you between all her acting and spying and getting caught?
Hello.

## What can I do for you?
Ehh...I'm staying at the chateau and the guy who runs the garage there said that you're the best Jag people in town...so uhm.

## He's writing. Hello?
If you're selling Girl Scout cookies I'm borderline diabetic.

## Vada what about you, who have you come up with?
My mother.

## Your mother?
I never met my mother.

## Hey Vada. How's your report coming?
Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know where to start.

## Nicholas! What are you doing up?
I...ahhh...umm...I'm thirsty.

## And you're gonna solve the mystery?
You know eavesdropping is a very unattractive habit.

## WHAT?
Calm down! We just have to ask ourselves, where your books come from.

## What difference does it make?
A big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time.

## Get married?
Change my name.

## What, you think the guy should change his name?
I don't think anybody should change their names, that way you can always find them when you need them.

## Why do you argue with everything I say?
You saved a lot of lives, you should be very proud.

## Care for a smoke?
This'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking.

## Does it work?
Well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.

## Boyfriend?
Well he was a boy, he was my friend...he was my best friend. When we were kids we were gonna...move out here and move to the Brady Bunch.

## Do you think your friend's up in Heaven now, looking down on you and watching you all the time?
Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.

## What do you mean Uh Oh?
...I dropped it.

## In the tar?
It was an accident, I'll get you a new one.

## Where are you going?
Owh...

## Right.
What's he smoking?

## And you'd be my cousin?
Yeah I guess...sort of.

## But we wouldn't really be related right?
Good. I mean...

## Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
I already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.

## Yeah?
This has been a real confusing day.

## You mean...it wasn't that terrible?
I wouldn't say it was terrible...it was...kind of...

## An adventure?
Part adventure...part miracle.

## Write me a poem?
Write me a poem?

## No?
I'll write you ten poems. Bye.

## Muh?
I'd consider it a personal favor.

## What's that?
Ten bucks.

## What's it for?
For the mini-bike fund.

## Well, wha...what kind of arrangement?
And you certainly shouldn't settle for anything less that you deserve.

## Vada!! Vada runs and jumps into Phil's arms Look at you, oh hi, hi, hi!! How are you? You look great, how's Shelly? Your dad?
They're great.

## How about Nick? Did he take good care of you?
Ahh, that's right, like one big happy family. This is Nick's room and uhh....

## But...are you engaged or something?
Dating, seriously dating. You're thirsty, want something to drink? Sure you do, it's been a long trip.

## Committed?
Committed.

## So does that mean that you sleep here every night?
Yes, it does.

## Do you think I should tell my dad about Jeffrey Pommeroy?
I don't know, he's got an awful lot on his mind right now.

## You want me to come with?
I should do this myself.

## Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah look, I've gotta get back to these bills, Phil will you help Vada get settled?
Come on...I'll show you where you're gonna stay.

## What's with the touching, why was he touching you?
He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...

## Oh...what's that?
Oh, yeah, sure, help yourself.

## I'm saying he asked me out for coffee, like a real date, when was the last time you did that?
Wha...what do you mean? We have a date every night.

## You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on Rose...what do you want from me?
I don't want anything you don't wanna give me.

## You're Nick's mother?
What, did you think he was raised by a pack of wolves? Don't be misled by the haircut.

## Go to your room. And you...I don't suppose your father gave you permission to pierce your ears, did he?
Not exactly.

## So what's wrong?
Nothing, nothing at all.

## Excuse me?
I was commenting on your hair.

## Oh, are you a hairdresser?
I'm a pediatric cardiologist.

## Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
Mostly...little babies, but...not exclusively.

## ...It's all in the hands really. You know you have nice hands, you operate?
Yes, I do.

## Something wrong?
Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.

## You couldn't?
Well I'm sort of involved.

## Sort of?
Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.

## Is there milk in them already?
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.

## What's this? December 8th, 1958?
I don't know, Dad doesn't either.

## Is that why Uncle Phil moved there?
Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little adventure.

## What do you mean?
How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.

## Shelly?
Hey! Oh look.

## Did it hurt a lot?
You have no idea.

## Beidermeyer?
Beidermeyer that's it, what a mad man.

## Do you know him?
Everybody did, walk along Citrus between Fountain and Sunset any afternoon.

## He'll remember my mother for sure. STANLEY It was a big class Vada and...but...well of course he'll remember, who could forget Maggie?
No it doesn't but... I...I wish it did.

## Wanna play?
You're such a baby.

## Uhh, it's nice to meet ya. Uhh, we got burgers and hot dogs here if you'd care to join us?
Can't stay, I'm just here because my wife.....

## Oh really, okay fine look, go cook, Gimme the goddam keys.
This guy bonking you?

## Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
The boss is watching us...

## Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?
No.

## Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.

## It's still available I hope?
I think it's still available.

## They're dead?
Yes they are.

## Stiffs?
I need the job.

## Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?
Yeah.

## You don't like it?
This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker.

## What do you mean?
Well the other night at dinner...

## She's a perfectly happy eleven year old girl, look, don't give me any advice about my daughter, okay?
Can not do without, Harry's wild about me.

## Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.

## No kidding?
Oh it's good, In lieu of I love that word lieu.

## You have to learn how to take a complement. Movies, movies, ahhhh, Love Story at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?
I haven't been to the movies in AGES.

## Does it make it easier to win?
No. Just, more activity.

## What's that?
I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.

## Oh, how do you mean?
You can be in a room with 100 men, and not like any of them, or you can be in a room with just one man, and he's exactly the one you want.

## No, why?
I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and...

## What happened to her?
Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born.

## Did she ever see Vada?
I brought the baby into the room a couple of times, she opened her eyes, yeah, yeah I think she saw Vada. It was.....

## Here?
This is where we are.

## Is there enough room?
I haven't danced in.....

## Rock?
See, you're not that out of touch. You're good.

## What are you wearing?
Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic.

## Want to what?
Kiss me.

## You know this is gonna be my first 4th of July picnic in a long time.
Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?

## How's it going chef?
Okay.

## Shelly?
You can get the general idea...

## Did you ahh, love him?
I would never marry anybody I didn't love.

## Dad?
I'm embalming my high school teacher, don't sing. All right Arthur, just a slide of the needle.....

## Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?
They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.

## Is it for a child?
Of course not.

## Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?
That's a lot of money for a little girl.

## Any more soda left?
Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.

## The money?
Ahh, maybe next summer.

## Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
Ahh, I just wanna look nice.

## Why?
She likes to play bingo.

## Can I go too?
Naah, I think you'd better stay here and keep Grammoo company.

## Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL bad?
Ahh, Vada, just put anything you want in the cart, anything at all. I don't know what's gotten into her today.

## Are they ready yet?
No, sweetie, not yet.

## When?
Soon honey, soon.

## When?
In a minute, look it's hot, sweetie you'll burn your nose, look out.

## Is that the fish you won at the carnival?
Yes.

## I told him not to tease those bees. Did he get stung?
Maybe I should go over and yell at him.

## Why not?
He was allergic to bees.

## He's okay isn't he?
The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.

## I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?
In the garage.

## What was my mama like?
She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her.

## Do you miss her?
I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J.

## Well well well, what's going on in here?
Nothing, I'm dressing.

## Oh, you're dressing, uh huh, Harry Harry Harry Harry, don't you know it's not nice to lie to your big brother?
Oh yes, oh that's great.

## Why?
The last date I had was twenty years ago.

## Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?
Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute.

## No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look?
Like a Sultenfuss. Go get 'em.

## That's what I do. Do you wanna do it?
No, no no....

## Hi, is Vada home?
Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone.

## Will you tell her I came by?
Sure.

## Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. J! How's the summer treating you?
It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.

## Mr. Bixler, how come you're painting this old house?
Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.

## How are you gonna get the money for this old house if you're not working?
Well I'm gonna teach creative writing this summer, so, I'm doing some work.

## How much does it cost?
Thirty five dollars.

## Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. This an interrogation Vada?
No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.

## For this class?
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.

## Okay, okay we don't have to talk about him, Vada, Vada we don't have to talk about him, it's okay. We won't talk about him all right?
Justin and Ronda say that I should tell people what I feel.

## Who's that?
That's Suzanne. She and I are gonna be married this Fall.

## Cool, can I get one for Vada?
Oh yes, yes.

## Do you think she is?
No.

## Why do you think she says that?
You know what I think? I think Vada's very lucky to have a friend like you.

## Does he love her?
Probably.

## Do you like her?
Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father.

## Why?
After your mother died, he was sad all the time, but before that, he was pretty funny.

## Really?
Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry.

## My Dad was funny?
Well he wasn't one of the Marx brothers, but he made me laugh.

## Is that your camper?
Yes it is.

## Who's winning?
I am.

## Chocolate?
Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing.

## I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?
He won't give it to me.

## Vada? VADA? What happened?
My ball, I lost my ball.

## Can we look around in your camper?
Sure. I'll give you the royal tour.

## Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?
I would.

## Did you read ALL these books?
Uh huh.

## What are they about?
Mostly love, and romance.

## Are you married?
No, I'm divorced.

## Can I use your bathroom first?
Sure.

## Are you going out somewhere?
No.

## So how come you're putting lipstick on?
A girl's always gotta look her best.

## Have you ever tried any?
No.

## Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?
Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.

## Do you like putting makeup on people?
Ssshhhhh, I don't want them to see me.

## This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit. We used to be married.
Hey Shelly, like seafood?

## Are you here to take Shelly back?
I'm hemorrhaging.

## What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
I don't want, I don't need your help....

## How old are you?
I'm eleven and a half.

## My Mommy and Daddy did THAT?
It's actually a very beautiful thing, and look there wouldn't have been a Vada.

## Thomas J?
I'm allergic to it.

## Wow, this is the coolest thing, like you really eat and sleep here?
Uh huh.

## Liverpool?
Eeeeuuuww, gross.

## What are you saving for?
Nothing in particular, just putting it away for a rainy day.

## At what?
That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.

## I don't like touching fish, how do you pull the hook out without touching it?
Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.

## If I do it, can we go?
No.

## What's wrong with your eyes?
A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.

## Where's your bike?
Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.

## What?
You have no personality.

## Hey, where does it say that?
Never mind.

## Is that your Dad?
Yes.

## Who's that with your Dad?
It's my mother.

## Do you remember her?
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.

## What?
Heaven.

## But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?
You know I'm not allowed outside my myself after dark.

## So?
Stand back.

## What do you want it for anyway?
For their meat.

## Hi, wanna ride bikes?
Sure.

## Get up!?
I'm tired of running away. Besides, we past this place two times already. We're not getting nowhere.

## Why are you running away?
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.

## Wow, was it a decoder ring?
You're such a retard, it was an engagement ring.

## They're getting married?
So now you'll have a mother.

## You can come to my house for dinner?
No, I'm hiding out.

## Hi Vada, can you come out?
I dunno..

## Please, it's real hot, maybe we can go swimming?
Well when you get older, you just have to.

## Like they do on TV?
Uh huh.

## Like this?
Uh huh. Okay, enough practice.

## For what?
Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.

## And I'm supposed to respect your fashion tips, because you're what, a New Yorker?
Something like that.

## What?
I'm just glad someone finally put this thing in its proper perspective.

## Stay, huh?
I honestly wish I could...

## Is it ever embarrassing, having your bum kissed in public?
If your ass isn't chapped, you are not a good-writer of note.

## Is it sad to be an editor, and bask only in reflected insincerity?
I've adjusted, and thanks for asking.

## There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
Then why are you compulsively eating? If you're not hysterical?

## You've been working on this, huh?
I wish.

## Neosporin?
Try less appropriate.

## I can't even say it.
Elmer's Glue?

## What do you suggest?
I suppose it's too late to start over.

## You're going to say it, aren't you?
Tell him you love him. With all your heart.

## And what will he do?
Digger and George are with family in the Hamptons until Monday morning. Brevity is even more in order than usual.

## Excuse me?
I can be quick. I can even be funny.

## Can you watch the road?
The twin part. I like to remain impartial in my contempt.

## So your honeymoon is exactly where?
It depends. If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there. Or Phoenix. Or depending on Indiana- Clevel...

## ... his snoring, yeah. He says it's worse than ever. That snaffle one...?
How about...

## Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
So it's sweet of you to be protective...

## Exactly what?
What you said. Make it appear that he's doing you the favor.

## He won't get mad, huh?
Your call. You can live a lie. In a fabulous selection of Red Roof Inns. Or you can make one desperate stab at hap...

## Uh, Kimmy...?
We settled this. And I reneged. That wasn't fair.

## Who? The jerk who's running your life?
This must be... very, very, hard on him.

## When are you gonna come clean with your folks?
Don't you see...

## ... that this is all my fault?
Yeah, well, lots of couples are imcompat...

## Have you ever heard of. Irony?
I never want to go through this again.

## It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
Oh, she's slipped out, the little monkey. Prob'ly with Michael, doin' the nasty.

## Ex-cuse me?
I had this crank call? From some guy who thinks he saw her? I said, what would a bride be doin', on her wedding...

## You are <u<so right. What a nerve on that guy! Bring my dress to church, huh?
If he gives you grief, I'll have him skillfully beaten, where the wounds won't show.

## Is anybody watching?
I hope so. This is all too mysterious to waste on just me.

## Sir, this is important! Haven't you ever in your life cut one corner, to make something important turn out right?
It's a fax from Sports Illustrated from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss.

## I haven't caused... a problem, have I?
Nobody has. So far.

## Best everything, Joe. But I'm going to dance with you.
I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office?

## Dance? You don't dance! You learn to dance?
... see, that's what I thought at first. How can you like someone that perfect? No potential for long-range livability.

## What's next?
Gimme like, eight and nine off the top ten list...

## Where was that, Florence, huh?
Firenze.

## The Vespa? Me hanging on behind in the rain all night?
Till the gas ran out.

## Hey, cabs are expensive. I'm cheap, remember?
Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.

## Wow and wow. You have a date, after this?
Never can tell.

## You miss her, huh?
No. I've got you.

## Don't you throw up on boat?
If you like.

## And I was thinking this could be our last time. Alone. Together. You know?
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.

## Dance card filled?
I'll check. I have it on powerbook, these days.

## Will she like it?
Yes.

## Listen up, huh? Even if you blow this deal, how big could it be?
It's over.

## I just want to be alone. Is that okay?
Get married, apparently.

## And your point?
Well. How come she didn't...

## ... your one chance for true happiness?
... yeah, that.

## The Big Hurt, huh?
Nellie Fox. Walter likes the past. And he likes the little guys.

## What's up?
Shhh.

## I mean, do you realize what you've... well, of course you realize, that's why you're confessing, I mean... I mean... how could you do that?
I didn't know it would get sent. I just wanted you to... get mad at Kimmy... and...

## It's not just a gag, huh?
No, it's, uh... a real big favor.

## Like family, huh?
It would only be, maybe, six months? Or three or four? It would mean so much to him...

## Oh the way out of the crab house? We asked Michael if we could see the ring?
He said you told him. It'd be safer with you.

## You got the money?
Right here.

## What do you have to buy?
Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids.

## Come on.
What?

## You're from out of town?
Yes. I'm cutting a record.

## Is there food?
No.

## You have to what?
Go to the King Of the Road and thank her.

## What?
Oh, Barnett, I'm so sorry.

## Honey, it's okay... How do you feel now?
All those people...

## Am I disturbing you?
I'm really all right, Barnett. Don't you worry really... I just don't want you to leave me that's all.

## How did you come in here?
Well, I guess you caught me at a weak moment.

## What did you say your name was?
Green.

## You going today?
Thank you-- Yes, I am.

## What do you really want?
Not a thing, Barnett, really. I need a little information. But, ah, it can wait.

## Barnett, John Triplette. How's she doing?
She's fine.

## How is that?
Everybody likes to be as good as their word.

## Whose word?
His Word.

## What?
They can come to the concert in the park.

## No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.

## How is she?
A little slow, but she'll be fine.

## Who the hell is he?
He's lining up talent for Hal Phillip Walker.

## Who the hell is he?
He's going to run for president.

## Third party?
He has that sign with the tree.

## What does he want?
Barbara Jean.

## Well, how about the shopping center?
Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.

## Whose?
Hal Phillip Walker.

## What's he running for?
President.

## National television?
ABC.

## How much?
Minimum.

## D.C.? Tammany Hall? He came there?
It's an appearance. It has nothing to do with support. I don't even like him.

## How come?
Yes, but we're just singing.

## Where are you going?
To the bathroom.

## National?
Yes. Percy Warner Park'.

## What crook?
He saw us at Tammany Hall.

## Oh... Well... Have you heard from Barnett?
Not yet.

## Let me know when you do, all right?
You bet.

## Haven Hamilton is your father? Can you arrange an interview?
He got killed at a turkey shoot.

## Your brother?
Yes. I was in my Sophomore year at Harvard.

## Harvard?
Some guy was drunk and hit him. Accident. Haven almost killed him.

## Do you know Barbara Jean?
Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.

## I'm fine. Can I go up?
Let me see if I can get the doctor hold on one second.

## You want me to wait?
No. Mr. Green, I don't know how to tell you this -- your wire passed away -- I thought they'd called you at home.

## What?
Your wire Ester - she passed away.

## She sure sings nice.
Can I help you?

## A little. What do you need?
Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, too.

## You know anything about the stations here?
It's hard to say. Doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. All it was was appendix.

## What did you say?
I said, maybe I'll change my name again.

## What's this?
Replacement party.

## Who's that?
A guy named Walker. Amazing person. He's developed a huge following.

## I don't really know what you're talking about.
How do you know?

## Have you seen a woman about so high?
No.

## She had on high heels?
No.

## Hey, there - You seen my Winifred?
No.

No. Probably stay at a motel tonight.

Nash.

## What year?

## I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
Nashville.

## How are you going to pay when you get sick?
I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.

## He doesn1t have fungus, does he?
I don't think so.

## How do you know if they do?
Weather's been awful. All those bombs dropping. It changes our weather. Sure not like the good old days.

## Does their hair fall out?
Your hair fell out? Just like your father. Weak hair.

## When did you start singing?
When I was little, in church.

## Well, can you tell me why?
It just is.

## How long have you been with them?
About three years.

## And before?
Just my church and my boys. We all had to go to school and learn hand talking. I just thank the Lord they can see.

## Do you ever do any writing?
No, I don't.

## Do you like him?
He's a member of our congregation.

## Yes. Who's this?
I'm here.

## Remember, about a month ago, your church choir cut a record?
Yes.

## Oh, Tom, of course. What are you doing in Nashville?
I'd really like to see you.

## Well...How have you been?
Well, they removed my heart last week, but I'm doing fine except my nose fell off. Looks a little funny.

## Who is thin?
Who is this, right? I called you last night.

## Oh?
End of Church Street. Next to a grocery store.

## Doesn't it have a name?
I can't remember. In out/out in, something like that. Around eight.

## When did you think it would happen?
I'm not sure.

## How old are you?
Older.

## Thirty?
Well...

## Terrific! Who was that black guy? A friend of yours?
That's unkind.

## Come on, you ever been attracted to a black guy?
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

## Just got out. Had me thirteen lawyers. Missed the electric chair twice. .. Been out three months. Are you heavy?
I'm not sure...

## High? Do you ever get high? A walk on the wild side. Ever do dust?
All I need is fifteen minutes a night.

## Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married?
What...? 0h, yes.

## You know who that is?
Yea.

## What?
They said go see the chaplain.

## Linnea?
Yes.

## It's me. What is it?
Can you make a rehearsal in the morning...? Courtland wants to...

## What time?
I can only give you fifty a week here and ten bucks for the benefit.

## Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Hundreds of times.

## For him?
Yes.

## What for?
You're real favorites of his.

## You're doing some recording here, aren't you?
An album.

## Where's Bill?
Sleeping.

## Where are you going?
Out.

## Pretty good. Sure was surprised to hear from you. You talk to Bill?
Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...

## Oh?
I mean...

## Mary?
We just got a gold record.

## Do they have a show to give it to you?
No Hell, some secretary in New York just hands it to you. Only this one kept dropping it out of the box.

## Did it break?
Dent it a little. Boy -- just she couldn1t even find it. She had a hamburger on her desk that looked three weeks old.

## How long have you been together?
Probably a little too long.

## Do you study at all?
Depends on what I'm studying.

## Yeah, you bet. You're really terrific. You know what I mean?
Come on.

## Why?
Hal? Well, Hal and I have been friends for a long time.

## Oh --
Well, I really think he's got a chance.

## You do?
Oh yea -- There has never been a better time for something new.

## Where are you from?
Southern California.

## Well, I admire your optimism, and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars?
I know a couple.

## No kidding -- Wait till I tell Linnea. Who?
Ah... Peter Finch.

## Who?
Peter Finch -- he's English.

## You really do? ~ God -- How come you know them?
Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.

## I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?
Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.

## You want a ride into town?
You bet.

## You think I got any kind of a voice?
You sure do it loud.

## Is that good?
It's not bad.

## You think I should take lessons?
If you're serious. Being serious is real important.

## You serious?
Wade -- I've been working toward this audition for years.

## You think it will?
Sure thing.

## May I see your costume?
I see.

## Don't you think they'd just love another song instead?
Now, Sueleen, you know that's not what we talked about right here in this very room.

## What was the color of Tim's belt?
The style of fighting that Tim studied didn't believe in belts.

## Is that a fact? Well then, Grace, could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that Tim was schooled in?
Tim studied several styles, but his favorite was Jeet Kune Do.

## Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands registered as lethal weapons?
Yes, they were.

## That means his hands are considered a weapon like a gun or a knife. Am I correct on that point?
Yes, you are.

## What kind of pies do you have?
Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.

## Which do you recommend?
The key lime is great, but it's an acquired taste.

## What did you think then?
I wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. And I wondered if I could wait that long.

## Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?
Try to keep it to a minimum.

## You got something you want to do?
We still got a few tricks up our sleeves.

## Who is we?
The prison board and the doctors who examined them.

## Were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the Knoxs mental state asked to re-examine them?
Using the same doctors is not common practice.

## I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
Thank you, sir.

## I can appreciate that.
Who isn't?

## The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?
By all means.

## Who's the song bird?
Mickey's better half herself. Mallory Knox. This little lady drowned her father in a fish tank.

## How's it goin'?
She's in the holding cell, on this floor.

## How come you never talk?
She was born without a tongue.

## What?
Anything.

## There's a chocolate cream filled in there?
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.

## How is it?
Ready.

## Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?
Yes.

## Whose ratings were higher?
Yours.

## How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on him?
Manson beat you.

## She doesn't talk?
Not to anybody. She sings.

## Mickey, how do you feel about cross- examining Grace Mulberry?
I'm keen with anticipation.

## We're about ready to go here. Are you ready?
Let's do it.

## Much obliged. What do I do for fun? Do you want to know what I do for fun or what I did for fun?
What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun for starters.

## Do you miss Mallory?
Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in a long time. What a stupid question.

## Do you think up these questions or the girl with no tongue?
Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.

## Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?
That's only part of it. I mean, it's a big, big, big part. But it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song.

## You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't understand. What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies?
Tell me about the purity.

## Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe Mallory. What's up here? What's in here?
That's indescribable.

## Says who?
Says the United States of America.

## When have they ever been right?
Okay, let's cut it.

## You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?
Sure.

## Where's it parked?
Out front.

## Mickey, can I talk to you alone?
No.

## Every week by forty million people. I am a respected journalist.' Have you won any awards?
Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The Edward R. Murrow award...

## So, what now?
Just wait one fucking minute.

## ...developed between the three of us. We're kindda in this together, don't ya think?
No. Not really.

## Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?
They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.

## And they made the first move?
Unfortunately, yes.

## Where do the air ducts lead?
Here.

## What do you think, Pitney? How much Explosives do you think that they really have in there?
It's hard to say Capt'n.

## The entire wing?
That's my opinion.

## How immediate is immediately?
Next week's episode.

## You can't be serious?
Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.

## So you're giving a man who butchers whole families, little babies included, my chocolate cream filled?
Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County Jail. Julie, just park in the front.

## Scotty?
Pleased to meet ya, Jack. I read your book. I'm impressed. Good work on Curtis Fox.

## And where do you keep Mickey?
We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place. But it just so happens that right now he's got a special visitor.

## Who?
Two-thirty. Shhh...

## Are you all set?
Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.

## They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?
Waitin' in the lounge.

## How 'bout Mallory?
Coolin' her jets in a holding cell.

## Jack, could you stay up here for a while?
Yeah, sure.

## When do you want the assembly?
Tomorrow.

## It's gonna be beautiful.
How's it working, Scotty?

## But how can you say that?
They're mesmerising.

## Why?
They passed the 'edge' along to us.

## How so?
But you'll never be whole again.

## Same here. Let me introduce my crew. Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie ...this is...I'm sorry. What's your title again?
I'm the superintendent here at L.A. County Jail. Me and my deputies are who you'll be working with while you're here.

## How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle?
Everything's coming along just fine. Phil, I wanted to know if I could have a small word with you.

## You met the kids I have working for me? Great bunch, aren't they?
Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.

## Is that her real name?
I see.

## Really?
I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago.

## See what I mean? It's a funny business, isn't it?
It sure is.

## Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do?
Lose 'em.

## Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very familiar with Mickey Knox's career.

## Two guys?
Okay. I'll take two guys off.

## Why don't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing?
Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes.

## How 'bout that furniture plant?
Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola.

## Where' you goin'?
Out.

## Want me to come?
No thanks.

## What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
It sure is.

## You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?
See Duff. He's the money man.

## What d'you say, Duff?
You know, Doris - you'd make some guy a swell wife.

## You think so, Frankie?
Hell, you got steady work.

## Fill her up?
No, boy. Thirty-eight cents worth of gas. And watch you don't make it thirty-nine.

## Goddamnit, nigger - you must think you're white! Who d'you think you are - king of Harlem?
That'll be thirty-eight cents.

## That dyin's gonna be done two ways.
You in a big hurry, boy?

## You Duff Anderson?
That's right.

## You a union man?
Used to be. On the railroad.

## All right, then. All I want you to do is tell these boys here you didn't mean what you said about stickin' together an' all.
Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?

## What's the matter, boy? Never smile?
I'll smile when it's funny.

## Where was that?
Walker and Williams.

## What did you say your name is?
Anderson.

## What d'you want?
Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.

## Where's Wilma?
She done moved to Detroit.

## Ain't she goin' to take the boy?
She got herself a husband now. They don' want him 'round. And I tell you, man, I got no use for him neither.

## Like where?
I don't know. He's your boy.

## Where's he at?
I don't know.

## How 'you doing?
Okay.

## Don't say much, do you?
Guess I don't.

## Would you like me to say anything tomorrow?
Guess so.

## Have anything in mind?
No. What you usually say, I guess.

## Where was your father born?
I don't know.

## His profession?
Well, he worked around.

## And his age?
I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.

## Any other family?
No. Just me. Me an' her.

## That's right. How' you doin', Barney?
You know, man, that guy was trying to be friendly.

## How 'you doin' man?
Okay.

## Oh yeah?
You know, over at the mill, there's just one guy that talked. It's kinda late to say it, but we shoulda acted different.

## Been over to the other mill?
Yeah, I been there.

## Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
Okay, I will.

## Haven't seen you around, have I?
No. I'm new in town.

## You working?
Yeah. On the section gang.

## You work around town?
I'm a teacher.

## Went to college, huh?
In Birmingham.

## No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?
My father's the preacher.

## Look, I don't know what you been told 'bout section gangs, but how 'bout seein' me sometime?
Maybe.

## What d'you expect?
You know, baby, I can't figure you out.

## Why d'you come out with me? You slummin' or something?
No.

## You don't think much of yourself, do you?
Well, that's a funny thing to say.

## How about another beer?
They must work on the section gang.

## I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?
That's fine with me. Keeps me out of trouble.

## How d'you mean?
Well, I don't get on so well most places.

## How come you stay 'round here?
Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids.

## That's why you come back, huh?
It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway.

## Scared, huh?
Not here, Duff.

## What d'you mean?
You almost got into trouble back there.

## Hell, baby, I'm not in the third grade. Well, look - what' we gonna do next time -- have a nice long chat in the parlor?
No, on the porch.

## What?
Well, either we're gonna hit the hay or get married. Now you don't want to hit the hay, and I don' want to get married.

## All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?
Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.

## Why did you?
I don't know. 'Guess I belong here more than there.

## Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
No.

## What d'you mean?
Hell, I don't belong here. I don't know what I' been thinkin'.

## Just for the day?
Goin' to see my kid.

## Are you married?
No, I ain't married. Well, good-bye.

## Surprised?
No. Women're always followin' me 'round.

## How old is your boy?
Four.

## What's he like?
I ain't seen him in a couple of years.

## What?
Your boy.

## What d'you mean?
Just what I said. Don't look so scared.

## Look, baby - I don't know 'bout you, but it's the right thing for me. I just know it is. So, what d'you say?
Don't push me, Duff.

## She don't mean nothin' to me. That's all over. Hell, baby - I'm askin' you to marry me. I guess you want a big scene, huh?
No. But a small one.

## It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
It'll be fine when we get done with it.

## Hey, watch out! Guess you want a house full of pickaninnies too, huh?
Don't call them that.

## What about him?
He could live with us.

## Is that so?
Yeah, that's so.

## What's wrong?
Hmmm - good coffee.

## Uh-huh. Why?
My kids want me to teach them.

## Huh?
Don't look so scared.

## You jivin' me?
Well, I haven't come around.

## How come you keep askin'?
I keep thinking about him.

## Hell, baby - I met this beautiful chick and she's just dyin' for me, okay?
Yeah. But just how're we goin' to make out? I got to get me a job.

## Don't ask, baby - huh! How much money you got with you?
About ten dollars.

## What the hell could you do?
Day work.

## How come you don't hate their guts?
I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.

## Ain't you goin' to say something?
There's nothing to say.

## Where're you going to go?
When I get set, I'll send for you.

## Where' you goin'?
Round town.

## What's so hot 'round town?
Take it easy, Frankie.

## How 'bout the key?
I bet she's easy jam.

## Like what?
Like a home, for one thing.

## What 'you signifyin'?
I wasn't thinkin' about you, Frankie.

## What's eatin' you, Jocko?
Nothin'. I just figure you were the right man for the job.

## Who're you?
I'm Duff.

## What's on your mind?
Nothing. Heard you were in town.

## Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
Yeah. That's right.

## How about a drink?
Okay.

## What happened?
Workin' a saw mill. Here's to.

## Plannin' on getting married?
No.

## Pretty good for a one-armed nigger, huh?
Great.

## My son? I ain't got no son. You Duff?
That's right.

## How you doin', boy?
Okay.

## Want me to hold the light for you?
No, thanks.

## Most folks around here got no use for nigrahs. Got to understand them, that's all. How you doin', boy?
Whenever he's got an edge on.

## How often is that?
He's been hitting it pretty hard. Got high blood pressure, too. I guess it's hard on him, having you around.

## Come back some other time, will you?
Yeah, sure. Good luck.

## Well, what're you going to do?
I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.

## Going back, huh?
That's right.

## How 'you gonna live?
I can always chop cotton if I have to. If you want a ride, I'll take you home.

## How are you?
All right, son.

## How come you all ain't sendin' them to the same school?
Well, you've got to go easy. We haven't had any trouble in town for eight years, and we're not going to have any now.

## Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
I guess I ain't.

## Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?
Aw, I do. But 'seems to me us colored folks do a whole lot of church-goin'. It's the whites that need it real bad.

## You'll be in trouble, son. Now just how do you intend to support your family?
I guess I'll rob a bank.

## Oh yeah?
I'll be seeing you.

## Why don't you guys buy your own?
Musta knocked her up.

## What're you gonna get out of it, huh?
Ol' Doris sure goin' to miss you.

## I guess you'll be quittin' the railroad, huh, man?
Yeah. All a colored woman wants is your money.

## What d'you know about women, Pop?
Well, I got married to one of them.

## Is that right? Think you're gonna make it with her?
I understand.

## No. Why?
Let's stay here, Will.

## Your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. Did you know that?
Shut up, Will.

## Is she good in the hay? No point marryin' her just to find out. Is there, baby?
If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving.

## Better now. Where 'you at?
Right here.

## Whoa. No way. You can't enter the kill zone.
You hate Raoul?

## Since when?
Since you got married. You got someone else to think about now, Danny.

## How long's it been?
I'm still on my honeymoon.

## We got any shots?
Bathroom. But he's nowhere near it.

## Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you?
I'm fine.

## They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
Of course.

## Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?
No. I only needed the code from you.

## She's very striking, don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?
She was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware.

## What about her?
Of course...

## What are you doing in here?
The Elders, mon...

## Can you get us into Straylight?
Gettin' in is easy. It's getting out I'm thinkin' of.

## I'm getting used to it. Where are we?
Straylight. Kitchen dock.

## What the hell is that?
Skeleton key. This opens the gates of Babylon.

## What you lookin' for, mon?
A place to tap in. I can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen.

## A little incestuous, but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume?
He's a vat grown Ninja, the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him, he's no joke.

## How's the villa's security?
Alright. Let's talk business.

## Why not?
I was set up. She looked at least eighteen.

## What?
Then you'll have to persuade her to tell it to you.

## And how do you suggest I do that?
Are you sure you're up to this, Mr. Case? We could reconvene tomorrow.

## What does this have to do with me?
Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.

## What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?
I'd say you were full of shit.

## It's the people close to me that tend to die... and I get the feeling you and I are going to be real buddies. Terms?
We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.

## Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
Questions make me nervous. Part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many.

## Why'd you do it, Armitage?
The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.

## What are you talking about?
Working with a dead man. Shit, I've done about everything else.

## And then?
Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now, that's all you need to know.

## What's this?
Could be your A.I.'s calling card.

## Did you trace it?
No, but it traced me.

## He's got a little attitude problem, being that he's dead and all, but he'll come around. Where's Molly?
Prepping your trip.

## Linked?
Yeah, well it's working.

## You see the couple up in the balcony?
That's Lord Frederick Tessier. Owns most of Freeside. Wintermute's mainframe is centred in the Royal Family's villa.

## The old man cheats on his wife with her own clone?
That's nice, but we can't dodge this kind of heat for long.

## Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
As long as you cooperate. I want it now, Armitage.

## What are you talking about?
The antitoxin. I'm not waiting until this is over. Give it to me now or there's no run.

## Can you read my mind?
I can access your memories, but I have my limitations. Hard wired programs designed to keep me from my full potential.

## Are you even really alive?
My problem, Mr. Case, is simply that I am a soulless bastard.

## The words?
The access code to your mainframe.

## What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.

## Ah, Herr Case. And how is the artiste tonight?
Fine, Ratz. Thanks.

## No girl? Only biz, my dear artiste?
Too bad. I likes you better with her. Now, sometime you get maybe to artistic; you wind up in the clinic tanks, spare parts.

## Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
Yeah.

## Case... Yeah, Miami Joeboy, quick study. How you doing, kid?
Fine, Dixie. Fine.

## That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?
Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck...

## Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.

## What elders?
Founders of Zion. Builders of Freeside.

## Maelcom... Do you think there's a hell for computers?
All things possible in Babylon.

## Ready?
I an' I, Case. Jah guides us.

## Do we have enough fuel to make it back to Earth?
Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.

## What you're telling me is that I'm dead. Right?
Right...

## What?
I'm surprised you still are. Should'a told me you had an A.I. running probes at you.

## Who got you into this?
A guy who calls himself Armitage.

## I duped these prints off him. Can you run an I.D.?
No problem, amigo.

## What?
When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.

## How are we doing?
That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web.

## Can you take me to it?
Not unless you have an unreasonable fear of dying.

## It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend?
Bright enough to be dangerous.

## The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
I'm workin' on it, Bro. I'm workin' on it.

## Where the hell have you been?
We got problems topside.

## We run. You crack the pattern?
You can make your move when it comes after me.

## What are you talkin' about?
I'll let it access me. That'll give you a free shot. Make it a good one. Dix.

## Not for long. It needs me alive and I still need its access code. You got a better idea?
Yo.

## How's the ice break?
Slow, but good. I got a nice safe blind spot going. C'mon.

## How long, Dixie?
Fifty-seven minutes twelve seconds.

## How much time you got left?
Less than thirty minutes.

## One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?
It's coming.

## You haven't got it?
I said, it's coming. Just get me in, man.

## What about the route to the core?
I'll get you there. Your problem is making it alive.

## What about the mainframe's access code?
3Jane's the only person beside Tessier that knows the code.

## What?
The angels... I think they're calling your name.

## Want to fucking answer them?
No!... No...

## Why did you come here tonight, Linda?
People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.

## Where did you here that?
Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case. I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.

## Case... are you okay?
I don't know. I don't know...

## Why would you want me to kill you?
Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.

## What's my end?
You want to hear the pitch, you gotta meet the man.

## What is it?
... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.

## Since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the Japanese?
Since Armitage sold them a program on it. Put them years ahead of the competition.

## He's a resourceful guy, your boss. How long you work for him?
Couple of months.

## What about before that?
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.

## Then you don't really know who he is, do you?
I know who he isn't. Not C.I.A. Not Sense/Net. But... money comes in. Doors open. He's onto something.

## What's that supposed to mean?
You've been calling her name.

## What?
Holy shit...

## How long have I been out?
Almost two days.

## How soon is soon enough?
Couple of days. They'll examine you.

## What the fuck... are you serious?
Go ahead...

## Too late?
Suicide. I just needed to set the record straight.

## Won't that mean you're dead?
Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.

## You okay?
...Yeah, but the Hosaka's history.

## I don't sleep much. You packed?
Yeah.

## What's wrong? Don't like flying?
Not when Sense/Net throws the going away party. They'll be on our asses from now on.

## Case... Are you alright?
Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.

## So... did you get a look at heaven?
Le Vingtieme Siecle. We're meeting Armitage there for the midnight floor show.

## What went down between you and Riviera?
I know you have. C'mere.

## When they did my eyes, I made them promise I'd still be able to cry. Sounds stupid, doesn't it?
No. It's important to be able to feel those things. We're going to pull this run off, Molly, and we've got to do it soon.

## Sure... Maelcom's a rude boy, right, Maelcom?
The code's some riddle of 3Jane's. Once I'm in the matrix, you'll just have to take a shot at it.

## ...And if I guess wrong?
Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.

## What is it?
Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.

## Peter... What do you think you're doing?
Surviving, darling. It's my specialty. Only this time I'm doing it my style. I've beaten him, you know.

## Like what?
Perversity, darling. The enjoyment of the gratuitous act. Tough to manipulate someone who doesn't give a flying fuck.

## What the fuck kind of questions are those?
Shut up.

## How long will they watch us for?
Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.

## Because he's Guy Perkins. Listen, you want to walk to Na- Na's and get something to eat?
Yeah. Let's do that.

## So what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be?
Professor of medieval literature. Novelist. Weekend flautist.

## Hey, Josie, how are you at Calculus?
Petty good.

## What is with this school and prom?
That's the old drive-in. They call it \"The Court\". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group.

## Have you ever wanted to go to The Court?
Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.

## It is?
Yes, it's lame.

## Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?
Exactly.

## I'm late for lab.
Hey, where's your sweatshirt?

## What?
Last night. 7,30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.

## Oh, man! Who told?
Roger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating.

## Gus, have you ever been in love?
Leave.

## No Roger from op/ed?
Nope.

## Hi. You're here for the sex talk?
Well. I like a man who gets to the point.

## You're Pam?
If you say so.

## What about the \"Roaring Twenties\" or \"The 80's\"?
Guess who I did it with last night...

## Okay. Remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it?
Yeah.

## I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?
Senorita Josie.

## And Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles?
So, you were a geek. Big deal.

## Anita, remember espadrilles?
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.

## Bridgework?
Very romantic.

## How about this?
Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.

## You need my help?
No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.

## George! What are you doing here?
Just get in the van, Josie.

## What is this?
Hidden camera.

## I'm not doing this until I speak with Gus.
Wings?

## Hey Josie. It's Josie, right?
Can I just say--I totally love Ex- Lax.

## That you would trip on your Barbie heels and I'd get named prom queen? Did I say that out loud?
That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day.

## Transitioned?
You crossed over.

## Why?
He is totally crunching on you.

## Hey Josie- who did Archie date Betty or Veronica?
Betty.

## Rosalind and Orlando. From \"As You Like It\"? Shakespeare?
Computer's down. Septuplets story. I need it back by five. Hopefully the copy's not a mess.

## Eh.
How many times have I fired her?

## Hey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk?
Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.

## They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
A flack jacket.

## You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
Yes, urm, she's right. I have learned it is a very popular place for the young people to go.

## Have you been there?
Uhh, no.

## Gus I, the popular kids and I, we just don't- I mean, I don't think I can do this.
Have you been to any parties?

## What if I say no?
Hey there.

## Maybe we should go in a different room?
I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there.

## You having fun?
Oh yeah. The best. Josie takes in the spectacle around her.

## Hey--what are you thinking about?
My sword.

## Hey Rob, what's going on?
I'm Rob's prom date.

## Don't you remember what they called you?
Josie Grossie.

## Are mom and dad here?
No. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn.

## Why is that impossible?
Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team.

## Is that true?
Little known fact.

## Really?
Because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. They don't even like people in their 30's.

## So what are you thinking for college?
Thank you.

## Are you--scared?
I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights.

## You remember that story?
That's what makes you interesting. As a teacher.

## Why do you do that?
That's okay. It's nice to have someone to talk to--

## When are you going to open your eyes?
I'm thinking when I'm home.

## Thanks. They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.

## Do you think you'll find her?
Yeah, actually I do.

## Well, are you here with anybody?
No, I'm alone.

## So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?
Wait, I was going to tell you--

## What?
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.

## Why?
I don't know.

## You so do not deserve to be prom queen.
Who are you guys?

## I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.

## Rob, what do you want to be when you grow up?
Well, a ball player.

## Are you having fun?
Yeah. Definitely.

## Where?
The deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, Sally... I thought I'd find you here....

## Didn't I tell you? I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?
Yes.

## If you went away, what would become of me?
I'm grown up now. I have to leave some time.

## Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
I can't help it.

## Just what?
Just me, I suppose... I'm restless. I can't help it.

## Nothing. W-w-what are you talking about?
Taste it.

## Why not?
I'm not hungry. What's wrong? I spent all morning on that soup. I thought you liked Worm's Wart.

## He's conducting experiments of his own.
Can't you make other creations?

## Maybe he doesn't know...
Experiments?

## You got your room straightened out yet?
It's getting there.

## Where are you going?
I don't know. COuldn't get the right price, I suppose.

## And you don't know anything about a murder across the street and a crazy girl who lived here - who saw the whole thing?
Oh, come on, Shirl, how'd you think we got such a good deal? Listen - all old houses have stories.

## Did they tell you she went totally out of her mind - that they had to put her away? And that her mother killed herself in our living room?
Don't tell me it's not the gas! Your mother thought she smelled gas.

## Alright then, what is it? Bird rabies? That cheap seed you've been buying?
Oh, please...

## Are you nuts or something? What the hell is that going to do?
I don't know! I just know he needs help and we don't know how to give it to him.

## Where's Jesse?
Could be all night. Guy gets his rocks off like this. Hangs out in queer S & M joints downtown. Likes prettyboys like you.

## You two got a thing going, or what?
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.

## You got a problem with me, Grady?
Naw. Just killing time.

## Yeah, why?
Shit, you can tell your old man he's a real chump.

## What the hell are you talking about?
You hit that ball pretty good, Walsh.

## Who told you to choke up that way?
My Dad. He played in the minors for a while, when he got out of college.

## You remember your dreams, Grady?
Only the wet ones.

## What are you doing here?
You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.

## Are you nuts or something?
Listen to me, Grady, this is serious. Something really weird is happening. It started out like just bad dreams but it's getting real bad.

## I believe you. You had some scary dreams, okay?
No! I don't know - everything's all mixed up. What difference does it make? I'm in trouble here. I need your help.

## What?
It's happening again.

## How come?
Ah, nothing.

## Look at this car. Are you kidding?
Hi! You didn't have to wait.

## You okay?
Yeah, yeah, sure.

## You know her?
Uh-uh. Before my time.

## This is amazing! Your dream told you where this was?
Only it was more like, you know, sleep- walking. All I know is I woke up on the cellar floor next to it.

## No. Never. You think that's what it is?
I don't know.

## Look, you got electricity in your body, right?
Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...

## And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
I don't know - into the air I suppose.

## I don't know. Where are we going?
It's a surprise.

## Here.
What is this place?

## What do you mean?
I thought you might be able to make a connection.

## Any ghosts in here?
C'mon, cut it out.

## Well, what am I supposed to do?
I don't know. Concentrate or some- thing.

## Anything?
Uh-uh. Wait...

## About not finding any bogey men?
I'll get over it.

## Maybe it only happens when you're sleeping - that's the way it was with Nancy, wasn't it?
Maybe we can do that. Strictly scientific, of course.

## Nancy went bonkers from this thing. You wouldn't be afraid of being out on the beach with a potential lunatic?
Ghostbusters are fearless.

## What is it?
I don't know - a sharp pain.

## Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?
I'm fine. Nothing's wrong.

## you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here. You had another nightmare, didn't you?
yeah, I had a bad night.

## You want to talk about it?
My Dad thinks I'm on drugs, my Mom thinks I'm crazy and I'm not sure I don't agree with her.

## Why won't you talk to me?
Will you leave me alone? Please.

## I killed Grady. I killed Grady, Lisa. I killed Schneider. Oh my God, he's inside me...
Jesse, God - what happened?

## Who, Jesse?
he's just waiting to take me. When I sleep.

## Who? Who's doing this to you?
Fred Krueger. He's been trying to get hold of me, to use me. He needs me to get out of his world into ours...He's gonna take me again.

## What's so funny?
We must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans' hospital.

## Eggs?
Oh...uh, no, just some milk, Mom.

## You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine. Just really hot upstairs.

## So, school going alright?
Okay, I guess.

## Making friends?
Maybe we should call a doctor.

## I'm not taking drugs, Dad. Can I go to bed now?
Sure...go ahead.

## How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
Fine.

## I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks. Any cute guys gonna be there?
All of them.

## Yor dad picking the music again?
Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.

## What's that?
We're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow night.

## You're going out?
We're going to bed.

## Mrs. Parker, was Kristen acting different? Did you notice anything strange before she made the attempt?
Kristen specializes in strangeness. I've spent thousands on psychiatirists.

## Did she always have nightmares?
They've gotten worse since I took away her credit cards.

## The maid packed a suitcase. Teresa! Teresa?
What are you still doing up? It's past one.

## What?
I had such an awful dream.

## Can't it wait till morning?
Please Mom? I just don't want to be alone.

## How's your hand?
Menthol, regular, ultra-light.

## I've been good. When do I get cigarette priveleges back?
Don't hold your breath.

## Girl, what are you doing?
Watching TV.

## If you get caught, I never saw you. Deal?
Deal. Thanks.

## So what do we do about this creep?
Last time, it was me against him. I wasn't strong enough...alone.

## You didn't think we'd let you go alone?
He's close...

## The city that never sleeps. So what will you do now?
I don't know. I'm busy with school. New friends. But I'll never forget the old ones.

## Do you still...see each other?
Yes. I'm going to see her tonight.

## But...it's just a house I've dreamed about. I dream about it all the time. Thank you for what you did last night.
You pulled me in somehow, didn't you?

## Have you ever done that before? Pulled someone into your dream?
When I was still a kid. My folks got divorced. After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing. I guess I didn't.

## That man in my dreams. He's real isn't he?
He's real.

## Nancy? Would you sit with me awhile?
Sure.

## You like gymnastics?
I was on the team at school. I was never very good, though.

## Freddy?
He's heavy in the halls...

## What's that?
They sedated me. We're stuck here till it wears off.

## Are you okay?
I think so.

## So?
So...got the keys to heaven, baby.

## What?
The dispensary. I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high. A night at Club meth.

## What are these, beauty marks?
Those are ancient history.

## Oh yeah? Well, if you're ever in the mood for a history lesson, I'm your teacher, understand?
Stay out of my face or I'll go straight to Max.

## Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
Fuck off.

## Max, where's Kristen?
She's been waiting outside your office since breakfast.

## I just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
Restless. Very restless.

## It'll be my last chance. Pleese?
You got five minutes.

## Crossed over?
But I couldn't go until I told you how sorry I am for all the things I've done.

## Anything?
We lost a kid about a month ago to Fairview. I don't know where he got the razor...but he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake.

## What's that supposed to mean?
I've had some experience with pattern nightmares.

## Only if you call me Neil. What was that nursery rhyme all about?
Just something children sing...to keep the boogeyman away.

## Never been here before?
Must have opened while I was away at school.

## Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood, which isn't saying much. your parents still live around here?
My mother's dead. Died in her sleep.

## I've been to Pittsburgh. Does that count?
I'm serious.

## That's a new one. Is that what they're teaching now at Stanford?
That's what I know.

## With Hypnocyl?
That's right.

## You want me to prescribe an experimental psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers?
Just until we get things under control.

## Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
We're gonna try.

## To who?
Doesn't matter.

## For what?
The truth.

## Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?
Take it slowly. Remember, this is a dream. Anything is possible.

## What are we going to do?
There's nothing we can do. It's out of our hands.

## The question is, what happened to Freddy's body?
They burned him to death in his boiler room, but they were smart enough to hide the remains.

## Who would know where they were hidden?
There's only one man...and its time for him to talk.

## Your dreams?
Hey, everybody has bad dreams.

## What'd you do, take the scenic route?
Sshhh. No time for that. Come on.

## What about Kristen?
We can't get to her. I've tried.

## And what are they?
The by-product of guilt. Psychological scars steaming from moral conflicts and overt sexuality.

## How do we get in?
They used to keep a spare key.

## What are you talking about?
You're about to attend a funeral. One that's long overdue.

## What?
Listen.

## There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort. I've seen you before. Sister...?
Mary Helena.

## You do volunteer work at the hospital?
I come from time to time. When I'm needed.

## This wing's been closed for years. What was this place?
Purgatory...fashioned by the hands of men. Twisted, lost souls, the worst of the criminally insane, were locked away in here like animals.

## You said something before...about laying him to rest...?
You must find the remains...and bury them in hallowed ground.

## How is he?
Cooling down.

## What did you think?
Frankly, I don't understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro.

## I know what it is. I just can't believe what I'm hearing. What has she talked you into?
Nothing. They're my patients. It's my decision. I want the dreams stopped until we get some answers.

## Good. You conquer the demon, but your horse is sinking in the bog. What do you do?
I go to bed and get a new horse in the morning.

## Yeah? What did we ever do?
Mom and Dad? That's...crazy. They never said...

## Where...here?
I'm in.

## I wonder if you could tell me where the...?
Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.

## What do you think of the guinea fowl?
I'm a vegetarian.

## I'm sorry? You think you deserve the brownie?
Well... a shot at it.

## And then I... right.
So I ask you when you're going to tell everyone, and you say...?

## Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
Oh... no one... no one. Just some... guy from the past. I don't know what he's doing here. Bit of an awkward situation.

## So tell me Anna -- what do you do?
I'm an actress.

## Oh splendid. Well done. How's the pay in movies? I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
Fifteen million dollars.

## Right. Right. So that's... fairly good. On the high side... have you tried the nuts?
No, thanks. I'll just look around.

## Really?
Yes. This one though is... very good.

## Would you like a cup of tea before you go?
No thanks.

## Coffee?
No.

## Something else cold -- coke, water, some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest?
Really, no.

## Do you always say 'no' to everything?
No. I better be going. Thanks for your help.

## Oh hi. Forget something?
I forgot my bag.

## Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try. Four o'clock could be good.

## Right. Ahm... the film's great... and I just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it?
Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.

## Are you busy tonight?
Yes.

## You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
If that's all right.

## Floppy, huh?
It's the hair! It's to do with the hair.

## Why is she in a wheelchair?
It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.

## And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
You know, I'm not sure. I don't think they'd tried for kids before, as fate would have it.

## Busy tomorrow?
I thought you were leaving.

## You abide by rules like that?
Ahm...

## What did you say?
Nothing.

## So who left who?
She left me.

## Why?
I don't know, I'm afraid.

## Here we are. Do you want to come up?
There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.

## There are lots of reasons. Do you want to come up?
To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.

## Why?
Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.

## Your boyfriend?
-- this is a fairly strange reality to be faced with. To be honest, I don't realize...

## Hi. Can I come in?
Come in.

## Don't think about it. We'll sort it out. Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
A bath would be great.

## I don't know. It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him. And you... and love?
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.

## I appreciate that absolutely. Is that the film you're doing?
Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.

## Would you like me to take you through your lines?
Would you? It's all talk, talk, talk.

## Hand it over. Basic plot?
Yup.

## What do you think?
Gripping. It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.

## You think I should do Henry James instead?
I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.

## You like Chagall?
I do. It feels like how being in love should be. Floating through a dark blue sky.

## No. What's that?
Big feet -- large shoes.

## You have a stunt bottom?
I could have a stunt bottom, yes.

## Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
Definitely. Ths is important stuff.

## The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
Both.

## What?
It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I'm allowed to see you naked.

## What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
Well...

## But... they're odd-looking. They're for milk. Your mum's got them. You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
Actually, I can't think really -- let me just have a quick look...

## Who was Gilda?
You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.

## Can I stay a bit longer?
Stay forever.

## What?
Don't ask.

## Oh my God. And they got a photo of you dressed like that?
Undressed like this, yes.

## How do you think I'm doing?
I don't know what happened.

## You do?
As far as they're concerned I do. And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.

## Excuse me?
Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.

## Well... how have you been?
I thought I'd give it to you.

## What's the thing?
You were saying...

## You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England?
Sorry about that.

## ... can I just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that?
... Yes, that's fine. Of course. I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.

## I see. That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
I live in Notting Hill. You live in Beverly Hills. Everyone in the world knows who you are. My mother has trouble remembering my name.

## Who is it?
Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job.

## Thank you, Bernie. Hey -- nice surprise, or nasty surprise?
Nice surprise.

## Liar. She hates surprises. What are you ordering?
I haven't decided.

## What's your name?
Rufus.

## Nice one. Would you like my phone number?
Tempting but... no, thank you.

## Is that right?
Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.

## He's bringing a girl?
Miracles do happen.

## Does the girl have a name?
He wouldn't say.

## Christ, what is going on in there?
That's right.

## Where are you going?
Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.

## Anna Scott?
Yes.

## The movie star?
Yup.

## He's cooking guinea fowl?
Don't even ask.

## Do you want to stay?
Why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman.

## This painting isn't the original, is it?
Yes, I think that one may be.

## But she said she wanted to go out with you?
Yes -- sort of...

## What?
Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...

## Is Miss Scott staying here?
No -- it's my 22nd.

## Of course it is. Any favourite among the 22?
Working with Leonardo.

## Da Vinci?
Di Caprio.

## Of course. And is he your favourite Italian film director?
By the way -- it's you.

## Yes. What do you think?
Well, yes. Groovy.

## I was called and I came. What's up?
It was good.

## It is great, isn't it. See you tonight. Hey, Marty-- sexy cardy.
Blimey. What's that?

## What do you think? Good move?
Ahm... room service.

## Oh great. Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
I'll see what I can do.

## What's your name?
Ahm... Bernie.

## Pleased to meet you. Did you like the film?
Ah... yes, enormously.

## Right, right. Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film?
I did.

## Any bit in particular?
Well, you tell me which bit you liked most -- and I'll tell you if I enjoyed making it.

## Ahm right, right, I liked the bit in space very much. Did you enjoy making that bit?
Classic. Absolutely classic. Profit from major sales push -- minus ?347.

## Who? Someone famous?
Topol.

## So it could have been neither of them?
I suppose so.

## Right. It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
Not classic, no.

## Right -- want another one?
Yes. No, wait -- let's go crazy -- I'll have an orange juice.

## Can I help you?
I have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery.

## Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
But it's not for the shop. It's for you.

## Okay. Tell me, would I have to pay a wet rag as much as I pay you?
Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.

## Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you, Martin?
Max. This is Anna.

## You haven't slept with her, have you?
That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.

## Do you ever masturbate?
I think you do, yes.

## No -- did you?
Bloody hell, I can't believe it -- my whole life ruined because I don't read 'Hello' magazine.

## Buggered?
Every time. But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.

## Well?
She's perfect, perfect.

## Any more announcements?
Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months. I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.

## May I help you, sir?
I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.

## How about Miss Flintstone?
No, sir.

## Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead?
No, sir.

## Can I help you?
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...

## Does she know you're coming?
No, no. She doesn't.

## This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.

## What are the choices?
Well... wait for it... First there's this one...

## Cool, huh?
Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.

## Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that?
Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...

## So -- any messages?
Yeh, I wrote a couple down.

## Right. No one else?
Absolutely not.

## Which was?
No, 'fraid not.

## That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
Oh shit, is that the time? I have to go.

## You're welcome. Did you find them?
Sort of.

## I don't mention that Anna's a vegetarian, did I?
I have some parsnip stew from last week. If I just peel the skin off, it'll be perfect.

## I don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it?
Maybe.

## Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
Spike. For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.

## I wouldn't go outside.
Right. Right. You think it's the wrong moment. Fair enough. Do you mind if I have a go?

## Why not?
Just take my work for it.

## Was it you?
I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.

## What's going on?
I'm going to throw out these old videos.

## Which floor?
Three.

## Are you sure you...?
Yes.

## I'm sorry. Which hospital?
Do you mind me not saying -- it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away.

## How was she?
Fabulous.

## Wait a minute -- she took your grandmother's flowers?
Excuse me.

## What?
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.

## So?
So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.

## What book?
The one down your trousers.

## Why?
I can only speculate as to the reasons why.

## Have you ever speculated, Mister Harding, that you are impatient with your wife because she does not meet your mental requirements?
No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's get it all out in the open...

## Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
No. Mister Harding, that is not true.

## Would you like to start?
N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am.

## Yes, Billy?
I-I-I-I-I d-d-don't s-s-see how anyone could lu-lu-lu-love a man who t-t-t-talks the way he does.

## Was it your idea to visit her on Sunday?
Y-y-y-yes...

## What was it about her that disturbed you so, Billy?
I was in luh-love with her.

## Good. Now if you'll just go along with Mister Washington, he'll see that you're properly oriented.
Billy, were you afraid of her, or of her love?

## Is there anything else?
Just that I'm glad to be here, Miss Ratched. I really am.

## How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
That music is for everyone, Mister McMurphy.

## What for?
Patients are rationed to one pack of cigarettes a day.

## Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
No way.

## But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.
Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?

## You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.

## Yes, ma'am?
Miss Ratched, would you please save a space for my aunt? She's comin' down from Portland.

## Yes, Miss Ratched?
Mister Washington, why don't we get a good head start on the day by shaving Mister Bromden and see if we can't avoid a disturbance.

## Yes, Miss Ratched?
Please see to Mister Bromden.

## Whatcha boys playin'?
H-H-Hearts.

## What's your name, buddy?
B-B-Billy.

## Stand aside, son. Any more takers?
That's okay, kid...

## Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.

## W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?
So long, kid.

## H-Hey, M-Mack.
Wh-wh-where ya going, M-M-Mac?

## Ease up on the star drag, keep the tie up, up and work hell outta that fella.
Yeah, kid?

## H-h-how's it g-g-going, Mack?
Just fine, Billy boy, just fine. Full of piss an' vinegar! They checked my plugs and cleaned my points...

## In ya go...
Whatsamatter, kid, what's botherin' you...?

## M-M-M-Mack?
It's okay, kid. Everything it going to be okay... I'll come back an' getcha in a while... 'Kay...

## Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch! Does anybody else know?
No.

## Ya like that, Chief, huh?
Yeah...

## What? Where?
In there.

## That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?
Shhh...

## How ya gettin' out, Mac?
Shhh... That's for me to know an' you to find out.

## Where's Martini and Scanlon?
Come here a minute, Cheswick. You, too, Sefelt. Hey, all you guys, come over here, I wanna show you somethin'.

## What? What?
So long, Freddy. Don't take any wooden nickles.

## What?
He's a big flounder. Could weigh two, three hundred. You got to lift him in with a winch.

## Does that mean we have to cut him loose?
Like hell we will! We got the muscle standing right here. All we need is a couple gaffin' hooks and some rope.

## Yeah, Harding, where do you breathe anyway?
Through the ass.

## Your buddy is callin' ya.
Ya know what, Fred?

## What are you doing?
I'm seeing what a busy man does.

## That's right, buddy. And you want to know who pecks the first peck?
Did to you and all the rest of you guys.

## And how do you propose to accomplish that little feat, my friend?
Just warmin' up.

## What for?
I'm busting outta this place.

## What's your plan, Mack?
Plan?... Oh, yeah, the plan... Yeah...

## Why not?
I'm not running a charity ward...

## What's he talkin' about?
Big king, too bad...

## Hear what?
McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...

## When?
Yesterday...

## Who told you that?
Gary Blinker...

## Can you borrow me a dime?
Sorry, buddy, I'm clean outta change...

## What's this?
Hit me.

## Yeah, Mac?
Bye-bye.

## Oh, what's that?
Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute.

## Is that so?
Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay for just about every season since I was able to haul my own weight.

## My, my... Ah, who are you?
McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy.

## Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.
Oh, what was that?

## In what way?
I see...

## Well, ya know, Doc... Doesn't it say so there?
I don't, Doc...

## Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?
No, this is my first trip, Doc.

## How are you feeling?
Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here.

## Good, good, and how are you getting along on the ward?
Come on, Doc, you know as well as I do what's been comin' down in that loony bin.

## When?
We'll let you know.

## What's the horse pill for, honey?
It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it goes...

## Are you a doctor?
No, 'fraid not...

## What's troubling ya, buddy?
I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.

## How do ya know that?
Because I quit breathing.

## Up an' at 'em, Taber.
You think it's funny, huh?

## What's going on?
Sure...

## That right?
You just come on with that three fifty and Martini will take care of himself... Your dice, Scanlon.

## Yeah, what's up?
Prayin', brother. Prayin'.

## Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?
Kay...

## Now, wouldn't you pray for twenty bucks, a bottle booze an' a piece of that angel cake?
Ah'm on my knees, brother, ah'm on my knees.

## Hey, how ya doin'?
Fine, thank you. Here, please take these.

## What are they?
To help you relax... please...

## You comin' in to hold my hand?
No...

## How's your ass been holdin' up, honey?
He's a patient, Rose...

## Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?
He can't hear you, Rose. He's just a big deaf an' dumb indian...

## Who is he?
He's in charge.

## Are you a doctor?
Sure, I know Chuck. I know him.

## What?
Hi.

## P.A. What the hell is that?
Potential assaultive.

## Huh?
Asshole.

## How 'bout twenty?
No way...

## Is everything all right?
Why, sure, ma'am...

## At this hour?
Cleanliness is a twenty-four-hour job, ma'am...

## What are these men doing up wandering around?
Ah guess the natives are restless, ma'am...

## Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all...
What happened?

## Is he one of the loonies?
They're sleeping, Miss. They're sleeping. An' we gotta keep it down so we don't disturb their sleep.

## Are they dangerous when they're awake?
Oh, no, Miss. Not these loonies. These are nice guys. Nice guys.

## Is he in an asylum?
He's dead.

## He is your husband, no?
Yes, but... He was having an affair.

## Your grandmother?
Look, she wasn't a relative, okay? I don't know who she is.

## May I see your boarding pass, please?
I-- I must've misplaced it.

## You ask what room he's in, okay?
Buona notte.

## Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago. He said his plans had changed unexpectedly. Would you prefer an interior or exterior room?
He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.

## Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.

## Why?
Because.

## So, what's the story with your friend?
My friend has lost her fucking mind...

## What's she doing?
She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker.

## What for?
So she can drive through the streets of Rome paging the man of her dreams.

## No, really. What's she doing?
Really. She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.

## Were they pen pals?
No.

## Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
No.

## Yes.
Did he do some anonymous good deed for her?

## My hair's kind of a mess, isn't it?
Your hair... is perfect.

## Oh, right. Dwayne. You're engaged to Dwayne?
You're sure...

## We found each other, didn't we?
Yes. We did.

## What?
My name isn't Damon Bradley. I just told you it was Damon Bradley.

## I don't get it. She hasn't seen her since she was a kid, now just because she's dying, all of the sudden she's gotta see her again?
Let's face it. Sooner or later we all die.

## Who's dying?
Your great aunt.

## Oh no. Do you?
No.

## Dwayne?
Dwayne Pinsley. From high school. That's how I knew you were here. When you called, from the airport.

## Sa dov'e' lui?
No.

## Ha un numero di telefono?
...has a prior commitment.

## What's mezzaluna?
A restaurant. In Piazza Navona.

## Yeah, but, what if this guy lived a billion, trillion years ago? Like, what if he was a cave man, and now he's dead?
Don't be stupid, Larry. If he's my destiny, then, obviously, he has to be alive.

## Yeah, but, what if he doesn't live here? Like, what if he's a cannibal in New Guinea or something?
If I live here, then he lives here. Fate wouldn't make a mistake like that. And stop talking. You're gonna ruin the spell.

## It was the moth stuff that gave it away, didn't it? I knew that was too much.
Larry, can I borrow your car keys?

## My picture's up?
Congratulations.

## It's an amazing place, don't you think?
Amazing.

## Smoking or non-smoking?
Non. Please.

## Lots of history. For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?
Hm.

## Hello? Is anybody there?
Dwayne Pinsley? I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.

## I can hardly hear you. Could you spell that?
Damon Bradley...

## I'm at the airport. Why?
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.

## I'm on my way to Venice. Why?
Venice? I love Venice. With the boats, right?...

## How could you do this to me?
I'm in love with you.

## Oh, come on... What kind of an excuse is that?
You're limping.

## Are you okay? You want some help?
NO.

## Why can't you just tell me?
If it's any of your business, yes.

## He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
You didn't answer my question.

## What?
He's a podiatrist. Pain is your body's way of telling you something is wrong. Your toe is trying to tell you not to do it.

## So?
So it wasn't real.

## What about the oasis in the desert? Are you telling me that was a lie?
No, that wasn't a lie. That was... a mirage.

## Why not?
Because. I know where he is.

## Where's Positano?
It's in the south. I've still got my rental car. I can get you there by morning...

## Why?
Because-- I want you to be happy.

## He likes to read... Did he mention anyone in particular?
Uh, I'd rather not say.

## Mickey Spillane?
Or Hustler.

## Right now?
Oh, and I forgot to tell you. He's here with his mother.

## Do you want me to do it?
NO.

## Anyway, that's why I came by. I need to fix this button. Do you have a needle and thread?
Nice dress.

## What are you doing here?
We were hungry.

## I just wanted to keep an eye on you. The guy's a total stranger, remember?
The Boston Pops. Season tickets.

## You okay?
Yeah.

## I guess he turned out to be kind of a loser, huh?
I'm sorry.

## No. Are you're leaving?
No. I just came by to apologize.

## You aren't?
No. I mean yes, I'm not. I decided to call it off. Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.

## Are you asking me out?
Yes. I am.

## There's no such thing.
Is something the matter?

## What?
Reptilian swine. There's no such thing. Reptiles aren't swine.

## I don't know what you're talking about. Who told you that?
No one had to tell me. He's starring in the local play.

## I sabotaged it? You're the one who lost him, remember?
Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.

## What would you call it?
I would call it-- unforgivable.

## Rational?! Love is not rational! Are you crazy?
Gee, I'm flattered. What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.

## That's not the point. And what if I had wanted to?
If you had wanted to, you'd have gone home.

## You're Damon Bradley?
Uh huh.

## Been here long?
Just since yesterday.

## Tonight?
Any night.

## Would you be willing to have dinner with me?
Sure.

## You would? Really?
I'll look forward to it.

## Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
Oh, Faith. My name's Faith.

## Really?
Really...

## Nothing. Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
Don't worry about it. You're my guest.

## What looks good?
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...

## So what do you think?
Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too.

## What?
Let's face it. You want me.

## I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it... Is Larry here?
Yeah. He's around somewhere.

## What about that guy you work with, Mike what's-his-name?
No. He smokes.

## How about that guy at the bank?
Scientologist.

## Is everything okay?
But somebody wrote those songs.

## So, what's your point?
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.

## Is he married?
No.

## Is he gay?
I don't know. I don't think so.

## What's he do?
I don't know, Kate.

## You don't have any idea?
He's a podiatrist or something.

## \"Thrills\"? That's what you're waiting for? You know how long that lasts? Besides, how do you know? Have you ever been out with him?
No. He's never asked me.

## If you've never been out with him, how do you know you don't want to go out with him?
He begged me to marry him. I didn't even want to marry him.

## But what?
Oh, I don't know. I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be. You know, like in the movies.

## Kate, is something the matter?
Larry brought me flowers last night.

## Have you seen him with someone?
No... I can just tell.

## What about your job?
I have vacation time coming to me.

## Does Dwayne know about this?
Of course not. I told him I was going to visit a great aunt. And don't tell Larry, either.

## I can't believe we did this. Do I have to remind you that your wedding is in six days?
Look, I know you think this is irresponsible of me, but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person.

## You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
How hard can it be? I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--

## The book said they have boats that are like taxis... Vaporettos. What's the name of the place we're staying again?
It's called... the Gritty Palace.

## \"Gritty\"? Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
I don't know... Maybe. Think of it as an adventure.

## What?
\"Of the Rich and Famous\". Of which we are neither. Are you out of your mind? We can't afford this.

## Are you sure?
Yes. Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.

## What are you doing?
He fell out.

## So?
Ah ha!...

## What'd you find?
A Butterfinger wrapper.

## Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
Only, it's in Italian...

## Couldn't we just have taken a train?
The book said they have a lot of rail strikes in Italy.

## You expecting somebody you know?
Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.

## So, what exactly is Larry's side of the story, anyway?
I don't know, Kate. I just said that. I'm sorry. I'm just on edge. I'm afraid we're losing him.

## You think he misses me at all?
Course he does.

## Larry bought himself cologne?
Polo.

## All of the sudden, I'm feeling kind of nervous. God, I hate blind dates. Why couldn't we just have arranged marriages in America?
You're right. At least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself. Smile.

## You've travelled over six thousand miles and now you're gonna play hard to get?
So what's in a name? I wanna join him. I don't see why we can't join him.

## Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?
Because I'm the one who's single.

## Okay, okay. You join him. But first will you ask if he's here?
He's heeeeeerrre...

## Is he looking at us?
Nope.

## Right, right... Okay.. You don't think he's gonna think I'm too aggressive?
That was really sweet...

## Don't be silly. How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?
Yeah. Sociopaths. They're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that.

## Sightseeing... What're you doing?
Packing.

## Why?
Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning. This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.

## A little bad luck?
Okay, a lot of bad luck. But that means the odds are probably in your favor now. This is no time to give up.

## So you're just quitting? Just like that?
I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.

## It was a ouija board, remember?
...and a fortune teller.

## What?
I'm just not ready to go home quite yet, that's all.

## You sure you'll be okay?
I'm sure. And Kate, thank you for coming. Thank you for being such a good friend.

## Yes. Isn't that amazing?
Amazing...

## What if he doesn't like me?
It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.

## Faith, I'm kidding. Is this how you plan to get what you want from life? When you finally find it, you turn and run away from it?
Kate. Thank God you're there. I need help.

## Uh huh... Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
Not only is he a momma's boy and a fascist, he says \"nuculear\" and \"irregardless\".

## Kate is that you?
Uh huh.

## Well, I realized, if you're getting married, you're gonna be needing the maid of honor, right?
Actually, no. There's not going to be a wedding.

## I'm fine. Have you seen Peter?
He's gone. He told me what happened. He just left for the airport.

## Larry, did you rent a car?
And you are?...

## You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
No. Well, I don't know. Well, maybe. Later.

## My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is. Can you tell us what she's saying?
She's saying he's a-- a-- porco.

## A porco?
A pig! A pig! She's saying he's a pig.

## How old are you?
What do the years matter? I've known you for centuries...

## Huh?
That's exactly what you are.

## No, why?
Well, there's nothing here to eat.

## This is the last one before the wedding, right?
Right.

## And we didn't have to bring another present?
No.

## We're all desperate for the money, doll. That's what made this country great. Back me up on this Candy, am I right?
Don't call me doll, Larry. I hate it when you call me doll.

## What? You know him?
It was just a joke. I was pushing the arrow. I wanted to get to the next question. I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.

## He existed. He was some kid I knew from Little League. He was a real jerk. You say he's a friend of Dwayne's?
Went to high school with him. But...

## It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
She didn't give me a chance.

## She went out to check into skywriting. I can't believe you lied. Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
It was an emergency. I only lied that night because it was the only way I knew to stop her. I knew if I didn't, I'd never see her again.

## I mean, realistically, what are the odds that this is a terrific guy?
Ten billion to one.

## Aren't you gonna go introduce yourself?
Oh, it's you. It's only Peter.

## Right now?
He just got a call from \"Mr. Upstairs.\" Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.

## Well, where are they?
We was robbed last night and we can't find no books.

## Why should he forget it?
Drink up, Charley. We're ahead of you.

## I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary?
I wish I knew.

## What do you want me to do, Johnny?
You said they was only going to talk to him.

## Working hard?
It's a living.

## You don't mind working once in a while to justify this lofty position?
I just fnished work. I counted the bags.

## Absolutely nothing. You do nothing and you say nothing. You understand, don't you, kid?
Yeah yeah I guess I do but there's a lot more to this whole thing than I thought, Charley.

## Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through the locals you know what they're worth to us?
I know. I know.

## Four thirty-seven that isn't where Gerry G...?
Take the boss loading, kid. For God's sake. I don't want to hurt you.

## ...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?
I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.

## \"In the church when you need me.\" Was there ever a saint who hid in the Church?
Father Barry.

## Terry...?
None of your business.

## Things 're lookin' up on the docks, huh, Jackie?
I think we're O.K.

## Which side are you with?
I'm with Terry.

## Everybody loved Joey. From the little kids to the old rummies. Did you know him very well?
Everybody knew him. He got around.

## What did that man mean when he said you were... .?
Aah, he's a bottlebaby, he talks to himself, the joke of the neighborhood.

## You training to be a nun or something?
It's a regular college. It's just run by the nuns. The Sisters of St. Anne.

## And you spend all your time just learning stuff, huh?
The moment I saw you.

## How would you've done it?
With a little more patience and kindness. That's what makes people mean and difficult. Nobody cares enough about them.

## What's that?
Pardon me while I reach for my beads.

## What-what? Where you been the last four five years? Outer space?
When Mother died Pop sent me out to school in the country. He was afraid with no one home I'd get into bad company.

## Do you like pigeons?
I'd better go in.

## What for?
I don't know.

## How do you like that one?
Oh she's a beauty.

## Listen, you like beer?
I don't know.

## In a saloon?
Come on, I know a quiet one, with a special entrance for ladies... .

## I am?
Wham... .

## How do you like it?
It's quite nice.

## How about another one?
No thanks... .

## Were you really a prize fighter?
I went pretty good for a while, didn't I, Al? But I didn't stay in shape and I had to take a few dives.

## Now what are you doing?
Describing you. A square from out there. I mean you're nowhere. Miss Four Corners.

## I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or or human kindness in your whole body.
What made you want to be a fighter?

## Why, Terry, who said it was?
Well, nobody, I guess. But that Father Barry, I didn't like the way he kept lookin' at me.

## His racket?
You've been off in daisyland, honey. Everybody's got a racket.

## And if you don't?
Why keep harpin' on it? Come on, drink up. You got to get a little fun out of life. What's the matter with you? I'll play you some music.

## What are you crying for?
I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm not I'm just all mixed up... .

## Why should I come hollering to you at all?
Because... because... Listen Edie, don't get sore now but I think we're getting in love with each other.

## What are you going to do?
I won't eat cheese for no cops, that's for sure.

## It was Johnny Friendly who killed Joey, wasn't it?
Don't say that, Edie, don't...

## Edie... Edie... ..
I'm tryin' to keep you from being hurt What more do you want?

## Terry, what's wrong?
I've been sittin' in the church.

## You?
Yeah, yeah, it's up to me, it's up to me he says it's up to me.

## Who says?
The Father. The Father.

## Terry what's happening to you?
I just told the Father.

## Told him what?
What I did to Joey.

## You think I stink, don't you? You think I stink for what I told you?
I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go.

## I'm looking for Charley. I heard Charley was waiting for me. Charley?
Charley.

## Are you sure they're your friends?
Jimmy...

## Terry...?
You're all packed. And here's your bus ticket. You're on your way back to St. Anne's.

## Are you trying to tell me Terry is too?
Let me by.

## About Edie?
Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.

## How much is your soul worth if you don't?
Conscience... . I didn't even know I had one until I met you and Edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts.

## Is that all you've got to say to me, Father?
I want to see you, Terry.

## Why don't you go and chase yourself?
Give me that gun.

## ...walk?
Johnny Friendly is layin' odds that you won't get up.

## Who asked him here?
Have a seat. I'm trying to find out just what happened to Joey Doyle. Maybe you can help.

## If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?
I'll go down the line, Kayo, believe me.

## Well, I had my fun, I've drunk my fill and I tickled some good-lookin' fillies I'm on borried time.
Down to the wire?

## What about it?
I thought I recognized you. Saw you fight in St. Nick's a couple of years ago.

## O.K. O.K. Without the bird seed. What do you want?
Our identification.

## Waterfront Crime Commission ? What's that?
We're getting ready to hold public hearings on waterfront crime and underworld infiltration of longshore unions.

## What?
I guess it's pretty tough work at that.

## Didn't I see you fight in the Garden one night three or four years ago? With a fellow called Wilson?
Wilson yeah yeah I fought Wilson.

## You sure looked it. Something go wrong?
Yeah. Johnny Friendly and my brother had other ideas.

## Such as what?
Listen, this ain't for publication.

## Condolences. How you fixed for cabbage this mornin'?
Oh me and my chum are just rolling in the stuff. We only work down here for a hobby, J.P.

## What's the matter wit' you, success gone to ya head?
I told you lay off.

## My ain't we touchy this morning?
How do you like them jokers? Taking me for a pigeon.

## I wonder how long she's goin' to hang around, huh, Terry?
Be sure they got enough water.

## Looking for me?
He's got his nerve, gum-shoeing around here after what you told him.

## You was a Golden Warrior.
Jimmy, suppose I knew something, say a mug somebody put on somebody... . You think I should turn him in?

## Yeah us Golden Warriors. You're a good kid, Jimmy, a good tough kid. We stick together, huh, kid?
You was our first Supreme Commander, Terry. Keep out of sight and I'll tell him you're out.

## Is Johnny in?
No.

## No?
Give me a double.

## What's wrong with your shoulder?
Hit me again.

## Yeah? Must be Danny-boy. I lost him in the last race.
Terry? What do you want?

## Well I got to watch myself these days. Know what I mean?
I'll bring him up to your loft.

## Hey, Skins --get away with that sheet metal all right?
Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss.

## H'ya, slugger, how they hangin'?
So-so, Johnny.

## OK skip it, Einstein. How come you never got no education like the rest of us?
I know, Johnny, I know... .

## Naw, thanks, Johnny, I don't want it, I
Thanks, Johnny... .

## It must have been once too often. I think your brains come apart. What you got up there, Chinese bells?
Aw, Johnny... .

## You want to know somethin'?
I said beat it! At the right time I'll catch up with you. Be thinkin' about it.

## What do you mean?
You know what I mean. Leave her alone.

## You think one bottle's enough for all them toasts?
Patrick, me lad, I'm ahead of you.

## You don't think he'd be helpful?
Nolan... .

## But does it have to be in a cemetery?
Shirley, I wrote for years without selling a single word.

## Who's to say my monsters aren't alive?
All of my books are based on fact, or legend. Thats perhaps why they're more interesting and sell in the top spots.

## Where?
In there.

## Then..then what's that music?
That's what I want to find out. We have to get help.

## What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
Something's making that music.

## Not dead? In a cemetery?
I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.

## Can't we get out of here?
I'm not sure...

## Don't let them hear you.
What do you mean?

## What can we do?
I don't know. I just don't know. But don't give up. We're not finished yet.

## You do?
Yes, that sudden. If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this. It's all your fault.

## What can we do against them?
I don't know, yet. We'll just have to watch our chance. When it comes I'll know what to do--I hope I'll know what to do.

## I love you Bob. I really do. Forgive me?
There's nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.

## You love me then?
Of course I do.

## ...And what is this?
DARKNESS A symbol, Master.

## What kind of symbol?
She came to us on the Day of the Dead.

## She was?
DARKNESS As I said, a worshipper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames.

## DARKNESS Well?
Ahh, she will be yours.

## DARKNESS When!?
DARKNESS There are others.

## DARKNESS Is there time?
You better hope there is.

## They are live ones?
Yes, Master.

## Live ones where only the dead should be?
Yes, Master, and we caught them, him and me.

## Have we in some way made you angry, Master?
You know better than that.

## Then why do you shake so?
It's not often an Emperor like you calls on creatures like us.

## MAN Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
MAN Aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh?

## Did you do something to get us into trouble again?
MAN Aannnnaahhnn.

## Did you howl off-key at the moon again?
MAN Aannnnaahhnn.

## Till it's not funny any more. What do you want, Jack?
You know that Super Bowl party? They changed the date. It's on tonight, eight-thirty.

## Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?
I said not as a rule.

## So why don't you come right out and tell me what you're talking about?
Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth. Out there in the free world.

## What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
What happened to Mandrake the Magician?

## What're you talking about?
Glenn Michaels.

## Oh, is this Adele?
Yes, it is.

## Who is it?
Lie face down on the floor.

## You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
Yes.

## You were both in the trunk? Together?
From Glades to the turnpike. Then I left with Glenn.

## The FBI didn't tell you I was with them?
They didn't tell me anything, they asked questions.

## But you know what I'm talking about, don't you? About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
I know a Glenn.

## I'm getting ready to go out. You can come in if you want, sit down for a minute. Would you like a Diet Coke?
No, thanks.

## He didn't hurt you or anything, did he?
You mean, did he try to jump me? No, but he was kind of talkative.

## Why not?
But you spoke to him on the phone.

## He did? I don't remember. Did he say about me? In the trunk?
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.

## Did you know that when you married him?
Really. Hm.

## Buddy'll take care of him. Keep him out've trouble. He's Jack's conscience. Always has been. He tell you how they met?
Till they got busted.

## Any idea where I could find Buddy? Or Glenn?
Ask him his name.

## Who are you?
You're good.

## Adele? You in there?
Yes.

## You did work for Emil, right?
Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years.

## You were his what, his box?
His assistant.

## You say you perform in the Miami area?
Yes, around here. I was a mayishan in Cuba before I come here. Manuel the Mayishan was my name.

## Why you want to do that, to a frien'?
It's Richard Ripley.

## Where in the hell are we?
That's the turnpike up there. Glenn's waiting with the other car.

## We may as well leave her, we're leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway, what's the difference where?
She's coming with us.

## Jesus Christ, what were you doing in there?
Get the shotgun. And her purse. I'd like to know who she is.

## Do we need him?
The green-and-whites saw us. One of 'em starts thinking, what's that car doing there? Ties it to the break and turns around...

## How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
His idea? Gimme a break. Fuckin' guy's got a vacant lot for a head. Was you and me figured the whole thing out.

## Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
Just that she got away.

## Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
You'll have to ask Glenn. And most likely, he's on his way to Detroit, where we should be.

## Am I going to Detroit by myself?
We'll leave first thing in the morning.

## Jack?
So call her up. Tell her don't talk to any Cubans.

## You at least bring the gun?
In here with my suntan lotion and beach towel. That's her place.

## I been thinkin', if I was Glenn, I was up there to take down the Ripper, where would I go?
Well, first off, if you were Glenn, you wouldn't be thinking.

## Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from Lompoc?
Snoopy. Christ, I thought he'd be brain dead by now.

## Whatta you think?
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.

## What's he do now, tell fortunes?
Outside of that.

## I think she's after Glenn. The girl still with you?
They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it.

## You tell your sister about it?
Just hung up.

## How long you talk to her?
Two hours.

## How long were you with the girl?
Forty-five minutes.

## Yeah? You think he'll let us in, we got Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole with us?
Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while we're off livin' the good life.

## What about that D.B. Cooper guy?
I mean, they don't know for sure he's dead. Look, there's always a chance we'll walk out've there with nothing. I say let fate decide.

## Let fate decide? What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now?
Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.

## Listen, I gotta get some better shoes, few other things before tomorrow. Why don't you drop me off at the Ren Cen, we'll hook up later?
Yeah, and I better call my sister.

## It took you, what, seven hours to buy a pair of shoes?
I saw Karen Sisco.

## And she saw you?
Yes, she did.

## So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?
You know how I felt about her.

## You find out?
Yeah, I did.

## So what's that mean? That you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks?
I don't know.

## Whatta you wanna do?
You know they gonna set us up.

## But you still think you can get the diamonds fore they do?
I'll make you a deal. Get out of here. Right now. I'll do the job with the Snoop, meet you wherever you want and give you half.

## Half for doing what?
Getting me out of Glades for starters.

## And who watches your back?
There's still time, take me up on my offer.

## You ever wear one of these?
I don't ski.

## You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?
Yeah, hi. Nice house.

## What?
They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.

## We made it, didn't we?
All you gotta do is get in.

## Yes, but I want to hear you tell it. Starting with when you tried to grab the wheel -- where was this?
Coming to the Okeechobee exit...

## What'd you talk about?
Oh... different things, prison, movies.

## This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
It was an unusual experience.

## Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks. You recall that?
When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.

## Is that what you would've done?
You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.

## I have to qualify, is that it?
You have to know what you're talking about.

## Yeah, I know. I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?
All right, but...

## Yes or no, Daniel. If I get him, will you let me go after Foley?
Yeah, sure, Karen. You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force.

## You get the key?
They're in 7D.

## Yeah, why?
The manager's door is metal.

## Now you see Foley and this guy Bragg come in behind us, whatta you do?
Call and tell you.

## And you let them come up. You don't try to make the bust yourself. You understand?
Leave it where it is.

## Wait. You not Adele?
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest. Put the gun on the table. I mean, now.

## What do you want to bet?
I could walk out of here.

## You don't, huh?
Daniel Burdon, please. Karen Sisco.

## You excited?
I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.

## Why you think is today?
You want, I tole you you can come. You all right, Foley. I like you.

## How are you, Raymond?
Freezing. But I'm getting warmer.

## What is it with crack and transsexuals?
Yeah, Eddie was a real character. Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes.

## Other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together. You gonna tell me why you're comin' to me instead of the FBI?
I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.

## Who was the friend?
Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.

## We're a few minutes away. Just sit tight, stay outta the house till we get there, understand?
Yeah.

## Yeah, I got a problem. This is the dumbest fucking shakedown in the history of dump shakedowns. Three hundred bucks for a pillow?
That's right.

## How much for your company at chow?
Company, shit. I watch the man's back.

## I bet. How much?
Another C.

## This doesn't concern you, Foley. Why don't you go on out to the yard, have yourself a smoke?
I don't smoke.

## Thirty-two outta what, twenty?
Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.

## It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper. Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?
Low class of people there, Snoop.

## Glenn didn't tell you?
Let's go outside and talk.

## Who's sitting here?
Your homie, Glenn. Only thing, he went to the men's about a while ago and never came back.

## The fuck you talking about?
Snoop, if you don't know where Glenn is...

## Look, what you worried about Glenn for? What's he know?
I thought everything.

## That what they're wearing these days to break and enter?
Break and enter, shit. Take it and git, how it's done. Don't waste any time. That's how you do it.

## So you've done this before, huh?
Shit, yeah. White Boy even got busted for it. White Boy, tell these boys the reason you went down on that burglary that time.

## You know how to use one a these?
I've seen 'em used on TV.

## Jack, you don't use a gun, do you?
Not until recently.

## Nervous?
A little.

## Why you're just a girl. What do you do for a living you pack a shotgun?
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest, both of you guys.

## You comfy?
If I could have a little more room.

## There isn't any. All this shit you got in here. What is all this stuff anyway? Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?
For your breath. You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.

## Where's your gun, your pistol?
In my bag, in the car.

## Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too. Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?
The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.

## Buddy. That's his given name?
One I gave him, yeah. Fuck...

## Why, are you famous?
Time I was convicted in California? FBI told me I'd robbed more banks than anyone in the computer.

## How many was that?
That's funny.

## Basically. Yeah. If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?
I don't have to. I don't rob banks.

## Is that right?
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving. Bonnie was eating a sandwich.

## You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
It was May, 1934, near Gibsland, Louisiana.

## You know who this is?
Yes.

## Who was it answered the phone?
None of your business.

## How do we do that?
Let's see. You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.

## Why not?
Because you're having too much fun.

## Why? You think he might tell you where I am?
Unless you wanna tell me.

## Don't leave me.
Whatta you mean we'll make it an island?

## Those guys bother you?
No, they're all right. I meant, you just got here.

## You like bourbon?
Love it.

## Well, we got that out of the way. Tell me, Celeste. What do you do for a living?
I'm a sales rep. I came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because I'm a girl.

## What, as a sales rep?
A girl.

## You did?
It smelled.

## I don't think it works if we're somebody else. You know what I mean? Gary and Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about anything?
It's your game. I've never played this before.

## Well, does it make sense to you?
Or once.

## If I had answered, what were you gonna say?
Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.

## What were you gonna do with me?
You waved to me in the elevator.

## Where?
Outside Adele's.

## You were going to see her?
To warn her about Chino.

## So she did help you?
I don't think we should get into that.

## You coming back?
I'm just going to the bathroom.

## Why are you mad?
Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill. Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.

## What about my motive? Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal. You think I will?
I don't know.

## You getting serious on me now?
I'm trying not to. I just wanna know what's gonna happen.

## You think I'd shoot you?
If you don't, one of those guys will.

## So. What's your point?
My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.

## You think he's lying?
Oh, hey, Studs? We thought you were somebody else.

## Studs. Man, I haven't heard that since Lompoc. What's going on?
Oh, nuthin'.

## In the trunk?
The backseat.

## What happened to your shades? Someone finally step on 'em?
I don't know...

## Whose blood you got all over you?
These guys, man, they're crazy. Shit.

## How many?
I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.

## Okay. How many going out?
I hear six.

## When?
Looks like tonight.

## You know who they are?
I do, but I won't tell you just yet. Meet me in the chapel at eight-thirty, right before lock-down.

## Sounds high, doesn't it?
Must be a real soft pillow.

## Tell me something. What's it like, walk in a bank with a gun, stick it up?
I don't know. I never used a gun.

## Really?
You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.

## Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do you believe Glenn?
Of course not.

## Twenty-two months, three days, two hours. Why?
It's a little late for me.

## The fish?
I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.

## And the guy sent you a bill for this?
It works. You should try it sometime.

## You goin' right back to work?
First, I'm goin' to Israel for a year, study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz... then come back, maybe take some tennis lessons.

## Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here? What's going on? Who's upstairs?
Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.

## What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her. She told him I was down in Florida.

## You gonna write me a check?
We'll go to my bank. I'll make a withdrawal.

## Dumbfuck Glenn was right, there's about five million worth in there, wouldn't you say, Richard?
Five point two.

## Hejira? What kinda name is that?
Islamic.

## What's it mean, \"No Hair\"?
The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622.

## The flight?
The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name.

## You were at Leavenworth, huh?
For a time.

## Meaning?
Meaning time came, I left.

## You busted out?
I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.

## That time?
There were others.

## The ninth?
Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.

## Like what?
I don't know. It's a long way down to Florida.

## You don't remember me, do you?
It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking. I was never out there.

## Do we have a gun in the car?
I remember you now. Shit.

## What am I supposed to do now?
Glenn, take the exit.

## Glenn, are you trying to steal this car?
Jesus, I don't believe it.

## Another one of those days, huh, nothing seems to go right?
I mean I'm not stealing the fucking car.

## I already stole it. Last week or whenever it was, in West Palm. I can't be stealing it again, can I?
The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.

## You're gonna bust me for picking up a car?
For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.

## What's going on, Glenn?
Nothing. I just wanna get the fuck outta here.

## But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.

## And is Foley a part of this?
He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.

## Why's that?
Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.

## But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.

## Really?
But listen, Glenn. If you're lying to me...

## You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming up here, do this themself?
If they're not busted now, they're gonna be. It's wide open.

## So you still haven't said, how you wanna do it?
I'll show you, soon as I get one more guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother, Kenneth. Along with White Boy there.

## What?
Wait a minute. I'm letting you in on this, not all your friends.

## Me?
Yeah. If you can step up and actually do it. Understand? 'Stead of just talking the talk.

## Can I do what?
Walk in a house with me, do this cross- dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin' on his own.

## What-- when?
Right now, son.

## Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
Yeah, Kenneth, why you have to do that to that poor girl.

## Why would I do that?
Hi, Ray.

## You look great. Your dad taking good care of you?
He took the week off so we'd have time together. So far he's worked on his boat every day. Dad? Ray Nicolet.

## How's it going?
Great. We got one of 'em.

## How you know that?
I can tell.

## Light to super-middleweight, as my body developed. You go about what, bantam?
Flyweight.

## What's wrong with you?
You wanted to tussle, we tussled.

## What do you want?
I'm looking for Maurice.

## That's not Maurice?
That's Kenneth, my brother. He's talking on the phone.

## You like to sit down?
Thanks.

## You not with probation, one of those?
No.

## No, I'm not. Maybe you know him. Glenn Michaels?
Glenn? No, I don't know any Glenn.

## Here? In this house?
He said he stayed with Maurice.

## Your dog was killed?
Got run over by a car.

## What did you call it?
Was a she, name Tuffy.

## Where do you think I might find Maurice?
I don't know -- the gym, the fights. I know he don't miss the fights. Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater. He use to take me.

## You fit another Chanel suit in here?
Something better. Open it.

## Happy birthday, kid. You want another Coke?
Can't. I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.

## Which one is that? The ATF guy?
He was. Ray's with the F.B.I. now, he switched over.

## He's still married though, huh?
Technically. They're separated.

## Oh, he's moved out?
He's about to.

## What're you doing at Glades?
You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators.

## How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
I'd like that.

## Huh.
What'd I say?

## What are you thinking about?
The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.

## No?
No, he looks a lot...

## Off a tip?
Hello? Yeah, she is. Just a minute. For you.

## Hello?
He's pretty laid back, confident.

## He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
Not at all.

## He waved to you?
I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.

## You wave back?
I didn't have time.

## So?
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.

## It's possible. Why?
He knew what he was doing. Nobody forced him to rob banks.

## Not yet. Where's Mr. Ripley?
I told you, he isn't here.

## Out for the evening?
He's in Florida. Palm Beach.

## You here all by yourself?
That's right, just me.

## How do I look, mama?
Like a fag.

## In case no one knows what he does. Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says, \"Undercover\"?
No. Course not.

## Did you pay the guy the reward?
Yeah, as soon as we got back.

## That's how you score now?
The woman also said he stole her husband's gun, a twenty-two pistol, and some of his clothes.

## What?
I think it's Dunn & Bradstreet. But then, I could be wrong...

## Excuse me. Snoopy? Did we settle the fish thing?
Yeah. Sure. It's all settled.

## Where you been hiding, Dick?
Midge.

## BOB We have a problem here?
Jack Foley, famous bank robber.

## White Boy, how much is the reward on the man again?
BOB Ten gees.

## Uh-huh. You recall, did it say dead or alive?
BOB I think he must've fell in.

## That's your line for tonight, ya know.
BOB Are they dead?

## What is it with Red? I've never seen him this way.
Are you sure they're here?

## Now listen, it's hands off Billy. I mean, you can put your hands on him if you want to, but then my hands will break yours.
He's been like that all day. Hey Danny, you coming?

## He was that good?
No, I was.

## But...they called you Strange? Because of Red Grange? I don't get it. Was Red Grange strange?
How would I know.

## COMMANDER On loan from Colonel Doolittle, is it?
That's me, Sir.

## COMMANDER Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter.

## You're Walker, right?
Yes Sir.

## You liked that?
Oh yeah. I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.

## Sir?
I don't buy that hot dog shit. So you and your buddies are gonna transfer your planes up to Haleiwa.

## Hale-what?
You'll love it. No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.

## What lizard?
The one that slept in my mouth last night.

## What the hell happened to you guys?
Yeah.

## Ever hear of mai-tai's? Comes in a big...pot. Like...like...
Rafe's girl, Evelyn?

## A m-missionary?
No, like...

## They ready, Earl?
Of the four left, only one is full of fuel.

## Who the fuck taught you to fly?
The Colonel helped me work it out.

## I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots.

## Didn't you say you told her not to come?
Yeah.

## Then why are you looking for her?
You'd always go sit in a plane whenever you were upset.

## Upset? Why should I be upset?
Let's go get a drink. Unless you're scared to talk about it.

## What facts are those?
I was grieving too.

## So what are you saying?
I'm saying now you do know. So it's time for you to fuck off.

## You left her. How's that for a fact?
How's this for a fact? I loved her first.

## How come you're not pukin'?
I guess I'm used to it. I've felt like throwing up every minute since you got back.

## Where are we going?
Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles north of here.

## What's there?
It's tight.

## You hear my okay?
Yeah. So you can call me if you need help.

## I got a half a tank. You?
Little less.

## What color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral?
Fun today. Like old times.

## Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
What do you mean? I'm just doing what we've always done.

## Hey! What is this, the planes all bunched up like that?
The brass is afraid of sabotage. This makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier to service.

## Who's gonna to that? Japan is four thousand miles away. So you guys just arrived, huh?
Yeah.

## How's everything?
We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet. Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.

## I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes. Do you think that's why we're meeting. To help us say goodbye to Rafe?
Sorry.

## Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
Well...sure.

## We won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we're airborne.
From the air?

## Then wh-where do we land?
I have a phrase I want you all to memorize, \"Lushu hoo megwa fugi.\" It means \"I am an American.\" In Chinese.

## How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it?
Don't get smart with me, son.

## Wait, let me look at that... You better come in here.
Explain what?

## How'd you get this?
Boxin'.

## Win?
Yes'm.

## What's your name?
Dorie Miller, 'Mam.

## How often you fight like this?
Every other Sunday. I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.

## What do you get for winning?
Respect.

## Danny's not coming?
No, he...got some news today. He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.

## You waited til tonight to tell me?
I had to tell you in person. Because there's something else I need to say.

## I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay. You are okay, aren't you?
Nothing that won't heal. I guess.

## And if we fail, and lose our carriers, we destroy our ability to fight them at all. As soon as the second wave returns, we will withdraw.
The second wave has not returned. And we have no idea where their carriers are. What is the damage report?

## What if the Japanese did invade?
We've done studies. We're confident we would turn them back eventually...after they'd gotten as far as Chicago.

## Have the planes made it to China?
So those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel.

## Well which of those three ya want fixed?
All of 'em.

## You see us as capable of such a blow?
The Americans themselves have made it possible. We will annihilate them in a single attack -- at Pearl Harbor.

## What's it going to be, Elizabeth? Seventyfive? Eighty?
I'm not telling.

## What's Peggy Sue going to do at your lodge meeting?
It's her 18th birthday, I want to show her off.

## Do you believe in all of that?
I remember that book! Grandpa, Grandma, I want to tell you something.

## Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do?
I'd take better care of my teeth.

## What does Grandma think you do at your meetings?
Stag movies. Smokers.

## I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma. Has it ever worked before?
The last one was six hundred years ago. It's about time for another one.

## Do you have to wear that hat?
It wouldn't be a lodge without hats.

## How do you like my hair?
But I want you and Scott to understand. Do you think he loves Janet? Maybe he's smashed too many fortune cookies.

## Then we'd both have a miserable time. What do you think?
Hey, you're a hip chick. You look like you stepped right out of Life magazine. Any time you want to borrow it again, just ask.

## Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
I don't know. Reunions do funny things to people.

## Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
Who knows. Remember... Whatever Walter wants...

## The only one?
Well, besides Charlie, of course.

## Where is it?
Were taking you back to the nurse.

## Maddy, what did you do to your hair?
We're going to take you home.

## He is kind of cute, isn't he?
Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.

## Did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts?
Just what you underlined.

## Come on. What's with you and Michael?
I bet Dolores told Charlie.

## What's the matter?
It's that jerk Walter.

## What happened?
After Charlie told Walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field, Walter decided he should do the same thing.

## Michael Fitzsimmons! Is he here?
Can you believe I want to marry that dork.

## Why do guys do such stupid things?
Charlie really has a great voice.

## But you love me don't you?
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.

## You got a Tab?
I don't buy them anymore. You were the only one who drank them.

## Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight?
I'm not going.

## Charlie! Am I dead?
No. You are the undead. You will live forever if you give me your Twinkie. Come on, let's have it. You hate them anyway.

## How do you feel?
Pretty strange.

## Oh yeah?
You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense.

## How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
Maybe I blocked it out.

## Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
They'll learn to live with it.

## Would you?
Would I?!! Why I oughta...

## Great, isn't it?
It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.

## Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right?
Right. I promised my mother.

## Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
He's trying.

## Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
Come on, let's dance.

## You really love me, don't you?
You know I do. I even wrote you into my will.

## What?! You mean sex?! Intercourse? You want to have intercourse! Last weekend you said... What time is it?
A lot's happened since last weekend.

## Save it.
I probably meant it when I said it. Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?

## What do you know about classical music?
Nothing.. Selling is selling.

## What am I going to do with you?
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.

## What are you doing here?
Let's go down to the basement.

## And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man.

## What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me?
Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.

## How'd you know about that?
I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.

## Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with?
What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.

## You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?
Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest.

## Does this mean you like me again?
It means I care about you and what happens to you.

## What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?
I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.

## Let me got! Where are you taking me?
Right here. Now sit down.

## What?
You're crazy! You're really out of your mind!

## Will you take me back to my grandparents?
Of course.

## . Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need you Peggy Sue...
Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?

## Charlie? Was I dead?
I thought you were...for a while.

## What about Janet?
That's over. I got tired of translating everything. She thought the Big Hopper was a hamburger.

## Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
Fine, thanks. Come on in. I want to talk to you.

## What would that be, sir?
Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.

## Test?
Carol and I saw you with that creep, Richard, today.

## I beg your pardon?
Take a long walk on a short pier.

## What if we're witnessing the end of touch dancing?
Terry, slow down.

## What, why?
There's Peggy with Michael Fitzsimmons.

## Fine. ) Grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel?
That's a day's work. But if that's what you want, maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday.

## She's unbelievable. Who needs satellites when we've got Dolores's mouth?
Yeah. He's so cool and mysterious.

## You don't?
He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author  fat, violent, drunk...

## What're you doing here anyway?
Coffee and a donut.

## Don't you get along with your parents?
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.

## No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?
I'd love to.

## Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
I can't do that.

## You think so?
Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.

## Can we split now?
I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something.

## What?
My father. He's not just the ultimate square. He's a total crook.

## If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?
I think I'm way ahead of them.

## Peggy, let me ask you something. You're not... expecting are you?
At my age? Don't be silly.

## Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.

## For me?
Open it.

## Quiet today?
This morning was good.

## I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business?
Yes.

## This is your great invention? Would you wear those things?
That's all well and good, but we don't have the money to manufacture them.

## You mean to tell me that you invited this Mr. Fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea?
Wrong, Dad. Your idea.

## How did it go with the pantyhose?
Oh, you're both so naive.

## I don't need your charity. I don't need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money -how could you do that?
Please don't shout.

## Does everybody have to hear?
I want everybody to hear because I don't have anything to be ashamed of.

## How do you feel?
I'm excused.

## What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up?
Oh. I forgot.

## When did you start drinking coffee?
Oh. Ah...recently. All the kids drink it.

## Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him?
What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.

## What about?
The house payments.

## Who was that man?
It was great to see everybody again. But it's so boring and regimented. Most of what they teach is useless. The worst thing was lunch.

## Would you get that, dear?
Sure, Mom. Hello.

## Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now. I'm sorry, Grandma.

## What happened to you?
I had a dream that Grandma died.

## She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right?
Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter.

## What do you mean?
Peggy, do you know what a penis is? Stay away from it.

## For what?
Maddy's party.

## Where have you been?
Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather.

## Isn't that awfully forward?
We've got to move fast. This is an idea whose time has come.

## Mom, how about a machine that's like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta?
No, just a friend of mine. I don't think he Likes JellO.

## What does Charlie think about that?
You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie.

## What are you doing?
I'm just happy to see you.

## Okay, what do you want? What dumb favor do you want me to do?
It's unbelievable. The man never ages.

## You think this'll cheer Dad up?
Of course, he'll love it. You're a terrific artist.

## What's up?
I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.

## Are you Peggy Sue Kelcher?
I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you.

## What was?
Dancing with you.

## It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
All right. I'll be in the physics lab. Make it fourthirty. I have a rocket club meeting.

## Are you doing some kind of science project?
Sort of.

## What's that?
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.

## So you think time travel is possible? For people?
Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.

## Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
Okay. I promise.

## How, did you know about my grandfather?
I don't know.

## Am I dead or not?
There's one way to find out.

## What're you doing?
Confucious says, The way out is through the door. There's a truck. There's your door.

## What if it's beyond science? What it it's God?
You're a molecule in chaos, a discontinuent aberration. Maybe you've just got powers of precognition. Well, maybe you're just out of whack.

## What if you're not here tomorrow?
The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world.

## But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.

## Give me some credit, will you?
Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.

## Wbat're you talking about?
Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. Fiftyfifty.

## When do we start?
Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.

## Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
Not for you. Okay, there's lots more.

## What are you talking about?
The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.

## What are you doing?
Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.

## That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?
Yep. It's going to be a law. I broke up with Charlie last night.

## Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
No offense, but you're pretty out of it now.

## Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...

## What will they be made of?
I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.

## In the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her?
No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.

## You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex?
No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time.

## Will you take of f your blouse?
Yes, every day. Maybe I shouldn't have worn that dress? I told Beth it was a bad idea. That's why they made me Queen.

## That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.

## God dammit! How'm I gonna got out of here?
Hey! Do you have any idea how much those beakers cost? I usually charge for hypnosis.

## What's the matter?
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.

## Did you break up with Charlie?
Yeah, yeah. I'm taking a big gamble. I've loved him for a long, long time.

## Why are you bothering me about this? Can't you leave it be?
I... um...

## Did she always have reporters following her around like this?
Pretty much so.

## I wanted to get Geoff out of L.A. Just start things over, you know?
I hear you've got Marjorie Hargrove working for you now.

## How'd you know that?
I don't know what you expected to find, Matthews. There's nothing wrong with the antigens, nothing to indicate an unusual death...

## Yes... why?
Because the last person that sent me blood from a dead animal was Yolander...

## Is something wrong?
Uh... no. You just... look different than you sounded on the phone. Please, come in.

## Out?
He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years.

## What happened to you?
I had a little run-in with Zowie.

## How long ago did this guy retire?
It's been a few years.

## What's a lunch cost these days? You want ten?
Sure.

## Hey! How was your first day at school?
It sucked.

## You alright?
I think so.

## Who was that?
Remember Zowie, Drew's dog? He got hurt again. I'm going over to take a look at him.

## Just out.
Hey! Where're you off to?

## I'm not hungry.
I'm really tired, Dad... can I just go to sleep?

## What are you talking about?
I can bring her back. The same way Drew and me brought Zowie back...

## All set?
All set.

## So where're we going?
Anywhere but here.

## Is he gonna be okay?
Drew, I don't remember inviting Zowie in for dinner.

## Just until he heals up?
Not that much appreciation. I thought we were gonna tone down that flabby ass.

## Your momma's worried sick over you. You take off in the middle of the night, you don't show up for school. What're you trying to prove?
I'm not trying to prove anything. I was burying my dog.

## What's his name?
Zowie.

## What was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life?
Nothing. It's just an old ghost story. Let's get out of here...

## Is this a good spot?
I'm not burying him here...

## Why not?
There's a better place...

## What did?
The old Indian burial ground.

## You want me to help?
You have to bury your own. That's the way the Indians did it. It's like a rule...

## How can he not have a heartbeat?
Maybe it takes a while...

## What do you mean?
It's like he's not Gus anymore. He's different. You know, like Zowie...

## What was that all about? You think he's trying to scare us?
I don't know but I'm not taking any chances...

## Do you think everyone that came back would be like Gus?
I don't know... ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...

## Dies?
I gotta go back and do my chores...

## You ever think about running away?
All the time.

## Geoff? Anybody see my boy?
Right here, Mom...

## How long have you been here?
Couple minutes. I saw the last shot. That was pretty cool.

## How did it go with your father last night?
Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight... I mean... he misses you, Mom...

## You know everything, don't you?
Mom...

## Are we interrupting, Andy?
In a word, Bob...

## Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.?
Bailey, Brackman.

## What in God's name... ?
Bob...

## What's wrong with your face?
Allright. Calm down.

## What was the file name?
K-R-O-one.

## Why, Beckett?
Because they deserve to, Walter.

## What's that on your forehead, pal?
Whacked with a racquetball. I appreciate your faith in my abilities.

## This time. What about next time?
There won't be a next time, I guarantee it.

## Really? Who thinks that, sir?
Oh, you're right, Beckett, you don't have an attitude problem.

## Aren't you giving an exam?
I said, don't worry about it.

## So what? It's nothing to be ashamed of. You have nothing to be ashamed of, okay?
It could be parasites, an infection...

## That's the third time. I better call the office. Would you relax, please?
I am relaxed.

## Why are you getting dressed?
You're not going to like this. Please try to smile...

## You got that right, Mikey... You still believe that, don't you?
Close the law book.

## You don't think there's much time left, do you?
That's not what I said.

## I'm ready...
You want me to give up? Let this thing turn us into victims?

## Ready for what, baby?
Whatever.

## If you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the Kronos suit?
I hoped the challenge would improve your performance. You could say it was a carrot.

## About my blood work?
We're waiting...

## Innocuous?
Funny.

## Jesus Christ, what happened to you?
I have AIDS.

## It's okay. Can I sit down?
Uh, yeah.

## New baby?
One week old.

## Thanks, Beckett. I'm real excited about it. What can I do for you?
I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against Charles Wheeler and his partners.

## You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown?
Correct. I'm seeking representation.

## How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?
Nine.

## We?
My lover and I.

## Your... lover?
Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years.

## Hell, they are staring. What's that shit on your face?
Makeup.

## As in, the vegetable?
The law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated, so long as they can perform the duties required by their position...

## Oh, Beckett. How's it goin'?
Fine.

## I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.

## What's her name?
Rayisha. Very nice.

## How did they find out?
One of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead.

## They didn't fire her?
No. They didn't fire her.

## Arline?
One more thing, Your Honor...

## Get it?
Let's find you a drink.

## What do you want?
Beer. We need to go over your Q and A.

## Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you?
Sure. It's fine.

## No, we have to do it. But later, allright?
Thank you.

## Do you... pray?
Then we establish how Wheeler's boys recruited you after law school...

## What have you prayed for?
For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.

## What happens?
We proceed, representing your estate.

## Opera?
I'll look over the Q and A.

## What impressed you about him?
He was... the kind of person I thought I wanted to be.

## What kind of person is that?
Obviously, at this time, you weren't sick.

## A regular all-American guy?
I suppose you could say that.

## Except... you were gay?
I still am.

## In the years you worked at Wyant Wheeler, did you ever tell Charles Wheeler you were gay?
No. I didn't.

## Are you a good lawyer?
I'm an excellent lawyer.

## What makes you an excellent lawyer?
I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.

## Can you see the lesions on your chest in this mirror?
Yes.

## What?
A good start.

## It was good working with you, Andrew. You're welcome. Hey. Shouldn't you put that thing back on?
I better get home. Lisa and I are having some friends over.

## What can I do?
Get down to Word Processing. Help Jamey look.

## You said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had \"an adventurous spirit.\" Is that correct?
Something like that.

## Do you take risks?
In my work? Yes. Calculated risks. You have to.

## In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life?
Not unnecessary ones.

## What kind of movies do they show there?
Gay movies.

## Gay pornographic movies?
Yes.

## Do men have sex with each other in that theater?
Yes.

## When? Approximately what year did this event take place?
I guess it was 1984, 85.

## But you were having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex.

## You'd heard of AIDS in 1984, 85?
I'd heard of something. The gay plague, gay cancer, but... we didn't know how you could get it, or that it could kill you.

## Do you need a break?
No.

## While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct?
That is not correct. I never lied about it.

## Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?
No.

## Do other lawyers at the firm keep pictures of their spouses or fiances on their desks?
Some do. I didn't.

## As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?
In some situations.

## You could have infected him, isn't that right?
Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we weren't aware of AIDS, then, or how it is spread.

## Really?
Yes.

## You've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with, correct?
That's right.

## Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
One. Here, in front of my ear.

## Hello?
Hi, Mom. It's me.

## Andy! This is a nice surprise. How are you, hon?
I'm fine.

## What's Dr. Gillman say?
Hold on, Mom. There's no way my client will go along with that.

## Hi, Mom. How do you feel on your fortieth anniversary?
Ancient. How do you think I feel? Put that thing down and give me a hug. Andrew, stop! ... He still doesn't listen.

## Where's Dad?
He's out in his shed showing your uncle his new riding mower.

## Thanks, Mom... Dad?
Objection.

## Miss Burton? Do you still work at Wyant Wheeler?
Yes.

## Were you recently promoted?
Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.

## No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
Yes.

## In what way?
Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.

## What did you say?
We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly influence the jury.

## I'm not worried. What are you doing?
The HIV virus can only be transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, namely blood and semen.

## Why are we going to do that?
Right.

## It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?
Thanks, Doc, but I don't need an AIDS test. Are you crazy? But thanks for the information. Really.

## Andrew Beckett represented your company in a lawsuit in 1990, is that correct?
Wyant Wheeler represented us.

## Were you pleased with his work?
We were satisfied.

## Okay, Mr. Laird. Explain this to me like I'm a four year old, Did Andrew Beckett win your lawsuit for you or not?
We won.

## Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
It satisfied me.

## What kind of people?
People who want to bend the rules...

## Good school. What year?
Second.

## What's the matter with you? Do I look gay to you?
Do I look gay to you? Relax.

## Don't you know this is exactly the kind of bullshit that makes people hate you guys?
Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try? Asshole.

## How many do you know?
Lots.

## Your Aunt Teresa is gay? That beautiful, sensuous woman is a... lesbian?
Duh...

## Since when?
Lisa, c'mon. One guy sticking his dick in another guy's mouth? It's disgusting.

## Did I ever tell you, I hate costume parties?
My lettuce is wilting.

## Yeah. Do I have a case?
Now that you mention it...

## A trial takes time, Beckett. Do you know what I'm saying?
Anywhere from two weeks, to several months.

## Any women on board?
Not when I was in the Navy.

## Going on... like...?
Like... two sailors playing hide the salami.

## How did you do that?
We stuck his head in the latrine, after ten of us had used it.

## Like firing Andrew Beckett taught him a lesson?
She didn't try to conceal it.

## So you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise, is that correct?
I know the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference.

## Attorney for the plaintiff?
Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.

## On behalf of the defendants?
If it please Your Honor, we hope to settle this matter.

## With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
No. We don't... However, as regards this witness, I'm going to sustain the defense's objection.

## It's good to be King, hey Charles?
Kings are out of fashion. I'd rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant. It's an anti-trust action.

## Andy. It seems that something has come over you, lately, A kind of... stupor, a fogginess, a lack of focus... Earth to Andy. Anybody home?
Helloooo...

## Holy Shit. Did you, Bob?
You'll be sorry, Beckett.

## You have to make a decision, is this guy partner material?
Jesus.

## What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
Charles...

## ... keep them from that area, on grounds of relevancy. What, Bob?
No matter how hard I try, I can't lose a file in my computer.

## You came for us....
What? What is it?

## Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. Anyone not ready for this?
Probably okay to talk to me now.

## Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started. Where you goin'?
Not sure. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing....

## What?
Tell me that was you.

## Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
Assailing my fragile sense of security, that's what.

## You mean...tonight? With all those things still out there?
Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot.

## Four fulls, one half. That mean we're halfway there? I hope?
I didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why I didn't say anything....

## What whispers?
All you people are so scared of me -- an' most days, I'd take that as a compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta worry about now.

## I got the quick-and-ugly version.
You did this? To yourself?

## An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?
Entered our minds.

## Why, what'd you hear?
Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some kind of deal. Just in case, you know, this actually --

## We can, can't we? Trust you?
Actually... That's what I been askin' myself.

## Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't we still following them?
Saw something I didn't like.

## What do you see? Riddick?
Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.

## What about her?
What it's gonna be like when we hit that canyon. With her bleeding.

## Back to the ship, huh?
Get out of our way.

## How many you see?
One or two.

## Audrey?
We're just here to carry your light, aren't we? Just the torch-bearers.

## What, you're afraid?
I trusted you, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.

## You'd die for them?
I would try for them.

## What do my eyes see?
It's starting....

## Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn? If you got a receipt?
Possibly.

## Hey.
Can we switch?

## Hey, who?
Hey, me. Over here.

## I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?
Only around humans.

## S'matter?
Little swamp-flu from the Conga system. Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep.

## What?
Tell me it's not a mirage.

## What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching the switch?
Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.

## What?
No juice, looks like it's been laid up for years. But we might be able to adapt --

## Like what?
Like my pistola.

## He used that?
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.

## So why isn't it all bloody?
Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.

## What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something?
You said it, not me. Let's just not let one bad call lead to another.

## How many?
15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. Five total to launch.

## 60 years ago.
25 kilos each, huh?

## He can pilot?
Hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.

## We can stick to the plan. If we get four cells back to the skiff, we're off this rock.
You have a little caffeine in the morning, I have a little morphine. So what?

## Look, we gotta think about everyone now -- the kid especially. How scared is she gonna be out there?
Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.

## Smoke screen for what?
For your own fear.

## How much?
79 kilos.

## He'll lead you over the first cliff. You know that, don't you?
We're just burnin' light here.

## So you noticed too?
-- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we are disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her.

## So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
Somethin' knocked us off-lane. Maybe a rogue comet. Maybe we'll never know.

## Imam. We should leave soon. Before nightfall but while it's cooler.
Well? Is it just the pump?

## What, you're goin' off, too?
Johns is leaving you a gun. Just do me a favor, huh? Get my crewies buried? They were good guys who died bad.

## He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.

## Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai', wait. I'm Owens. Right?
1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. Somethin' took a swipe at us.

## Fry?
Can't get my nose down...too much load back there....

## So quiet. You get used to the sounds of the ship, then....
You mean that \"load\" of passengers?

## Some prophet guy?
\"Some prophet guy.\" And a city man. But he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of God.

## You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?
Frightening thought.

## One is all?
For now.

## Riddick?
They're afraid of our light. That means we don't have to be so afraid of them.

## And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
No, I'm not. But he can.

## What?
Don't stop, just slow down. Little more space 'tween us and them.

## And what about the cells?
Oh, no. No, no, no....

## Which half?
You mean....

## What're you doin'?
Blessing you like the others. It's painless.

## Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
It's more a place where souls are found, Mr. Riddick.

## For what? There is no water. You understand that, don't you?
All deserts have water, somewhere. God shall lead us there.

## \"God is Great,\" yes?
...then we saw this.

## Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside from me?
King Tut's tomb....

## What the hell are these?
Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare.

## Like an emergency life-raft, right?
Very big beads.

## Found somethin' worse than me, huh?
We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if I shouldn't lighten the load right now.

## For what? The honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?
Truth is, Riddick, I'm tired of this head-up shit. I wanna be free of you as much as you wanna be free of me.

## You'd cut me loose, Boss?
Only if we both get outta this alive. And there may be a way.

## Not afraid of the dark, are you?
I'd rather piss glass.

## Wanna rag your fat mouth?
Think about that reward, Johns.

## Well, what's it look like now?
Looks clear.

## Ain't all of us gonna make it.
About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!

## Six of us left. If we could get through that canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing, right?
Not if I'm the one.

## What if you're one of five?
Kept calling it \"murder\" when I did it.

## So which one caught your eye?
Don' look, don' look, don' look....

## What do you care?
Then let's not name the Thanksgiving turkey, okay? I assume you still got a shiv.

## What's one more to you? Like this is the one that sends you to Hell?
Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere. Or forget the museum -- maybe they should just hang you.

## An' this?
Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very very rare, since the tribe's extinct.

## Well, what's the need, anyway? If he's gone, he's gone. Why should he bother us?
So much for your nightfall.

## What, you don't really think they left with their clothes on the lines? Photos on the walls?
Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know.

## What, it's broken?
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.

## You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
Certainly, sir. It's a pleasure to see you again.

## How did you know we'd come here?
I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts. They're worthless.

## Seal the cave?
That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.

## Do you have any weapons?
The best. But we won't need them.

## It's a long detour to Dead Lake. What would we find?
Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my countrymen.

## Where does the river lead?
It empties into a sea some miles from here. That's where the cave is.

## When are you going to show me what's in the cave?
Right now, if you like.

## Reconstructing a life. Care to have a look?
That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.

## Do you have to work tonight?
No.

## Watch. Hello, Bright Eyes. How's our throat today?
Look -- she remembers.

## Remembers what?
The blood transfusion.

## Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?' I don't know.
Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?

## And they fell out of the sky with you?
Flight is a scientific impossibility.

## Cornelius, why do you insist on provoking him?
No creature can survive in that part of the Forbidden Zone. I've been there. I've seen it.

## Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?
Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it.

## How did it go?
There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us.

## One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9. We've enough food and water for three days.
Got your sensors?

## But how long is a day?
Good question. Landon -- check your communications kit.

## Any sign of dangerous ionization?
No.

## Which direction?
That way.

## Any particular reason?
None at all.

## Which one was wearing the strange clothes?
Him.

## Will he live?
I don't know. This beast lost a lot of blood.

## But the quota system's been abolished! You made it. Why can't I?
What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.

## Well, Dr. Zira? This is a man, is he not?
State your case, Mr. Prosecutor.

## Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?
I admit, I know nothing of your culture.

## Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
No change. The minute you open the door, he goes into his act.

## Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?
He's trying to form words.

## Those fools and their torches! Do you have any ointment?
I'll see.

## We're here to stay.
What signal?

## Well? Where are we? Have any notion, skipper?
Landon! Join the expedition.

## Sorry... I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?
Air leak. Died in her sleep.

## Scarecrows?
Let's take a look.

## Can we take a dip?
Okay.

## Fine. Just let her out.
Who are you?

## Shouldn't we be moving on?
I'm for that.

## Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?
In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.

## All right, all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders.
Not everything. They left a hostage. How do you feel, Lucius?

## What is it?
I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.

## They think you're behaving foolishly. I must say I agree. Where will you go?
I'll start by following the shoreline. And my nose.

## What?
The flags of discontent. It's the only way anything ever gets changed. Don't try to follow us. I'm pretty handy with things like this.

## Who put them up?
The Hunt Club.

## What is that?
A man, Dr. Maximus.

## Why special?
We're -- conducting a new experiment.

## How so?
With one of them.

## What about me?
No.

## You lied. Where is your tribe?
My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.

## A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent. Where were you nurtured?
I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.

## Thank you for calling me Taylor. Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
I don't know.

## All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.
I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?

## When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
Twelve hundred years ago.

## Then there is another jungle?
Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.

## Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
No, thanks. I'll take freedom.

## There! Can you believe it? I looks like he's talking.
Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?

## What is this?
A hearing.

## Which one?
Second from the left.

## You! ... You knew about this?
No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.

## Are you going to take her with you?
Yes.

## You want her that much?
You threw us together, remember? And you guessed right. Men, like apes, get despondent without a mate.

## What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch of the sun?
She's not sick at all. She's pregnant.

## Why not?
It's humiliating.

## Would you like to come along?
Yes, Sir.

## Do you believe him?
Like you, I find it difficult.

## How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. And his other companion?
He doesn't know.

## Secondly, if these 'tools' as you call them, are unidentified, why are they introduced as 'evidence' of anything?
But there's the doll, sir.

## But the proof? The doll?
In a few minutes there will be no doll. There can't be. I'm sorry.

## Where?
...but 'Lias is still out there.

## He's dead! Where?... You saw him?
Yeah. Back about 100 metres. He's dead, now get going, the gooks are all over the fuckin' place.

## How the hell did he get away?
Don't tell me how to fight this fucking war, 'Lias, you go crying to fucking brigade on your time. Out here you belong to me. Now move.

## So what's the problem?
Says he can't walk.

## Sarge?
Yeah that long hairy orange and black bastard I found in the ammo crate. I'm gonna put it in this asshole's crotch, see if he can walk.

## Yeah, what is it?
I can't do that for you, Red... We need every swinging dick in the field. Sorry bout that...

## Bob, I gotta bad feeling about this, I... I'm telling you I got a bad feeling, man, I don't think I'm gonna make it... y'know what I mean?
...everybody gotta die sometime Red... Get back to your foxhole.

## You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
Don you worry Bunny, youse a killer anyway.

## Yeah?
Barnes comes from Hell.

## Does he have a metal plate in his head?
You mean he's crazy? No more crazy'n the rest of us been out in the bush too long.

## Where's Elias come from?
Lias come naturally.

## First time?
Yeah.

## Feel good?
Yeah. No pain in my neck now. Feels good.

## But what'd she actually do?
She was a crossbreed, Chinese and Polish.

## Barnes got it in for you, don't he?
Barnes believes in what he's doing.

## And you, do you believe?
In '65 - yeah. Now... No. What happened today's just the beginning. We're gonna lose this war...

## You really think so... us?
Oh shit! Sometimes there's things in my head... man. Grass does that to me, fucks me all up like a crazy Indian...

## Do you believe that stuff about... knowing you're gonna die?
I'll go with you.

## What you got there - beers?
Yeah, just stole me some from the Top's supply but he's stealing it from us anyway. Chucks are coming. You better 'didi' man.

## You okay man? Neck botherin' you?
Nah...

## What are the heads?
...Motherfuckah, motherfuckah, I'm too short to be dealing with this shit! They keep fucking with us man, no letup...

## You volunteered for this shit man?
You a crazy fucker, givin' up college man.

## What we got here a crusader?
Sounds like it.

## Whatcha doing in the underworld Taylor?
This ain't Taylor. Taylor been shot. This man Chris been resurrected...

## Whew! - where that come from?
Found it. Growing in a garden.

## You wanted to see me sir?
Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.

## You don't want to hear about it?
That's right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay... I just don't give a shit anymore.

## How far does this train go?
Vancouver, B.C.

## Is it? I expected to go to the Vancouver Royal. Should I have a reservation?
I'll make one for you. I live there.

## A very small service. It doesn't even ask for thanks. How long for?
I really don't know.

## Indefinitely?
I don't know.

## No thanks?
Thank you.

## Suppose I hadn't known that immigration inspector? Hadn't put in a good word for you?
I'm supposing.

## Yes?
How about taking to Uncle Larry into the old firm? He's a useful guy to have on your side.

## Not tonight.
Don't get me wrong, Betty. I'm not suggesting you murdered anybody, you know.

## What's the matter?
I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.

## The brush-off, huh?
I'm trying very hard to be polite about it.

## Would you mind?
Okay. You win.

## How do you do?
I think I'd like to dance.

## How careful should I be?
Maybe you're going to have to like me.

## What's the matter, baby? Don't you like being kissed?
Next time you try that, Mr. Mitchell... ..don't. I'm warning you.

## How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?
I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane.

## Immigration Officer?
They might think I was running away from something.

## I'm Miss Mayfield. Is Mr. Campbell here?
I'm Mr. Campbell, Miss Mayfield. Purely as a matter of routine, I want to ask the name of your bank.

## Bank?
Merely for our records, Miss Mayfield. It's usual for the guests who come here for the first time.

## I'm carrying quite a large sum in Travelers checks. How much of a deposit would you like?
You can have the table yourself, if you'd rather. I'm only killing time.

## What did you say his name was?
You don't sound as if you liked him very much.

## Sure. But I'd hate like the Dickens to be held to everything I've said before, wouldn't you?
You're not paying for this. It's quite enough that you let me sit at your table.

## No. Are you really going to drink that stuff?
You're drinking it.

## Would it make you anymore amusing?
Whatever you say.

## Do you think I don't?
Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.

## You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
He doesn't even know half the people who come up to drink his liquor.

## Dance?
No thank you.

## He got in here how?
Not with my consent, strange as it seems. I don't know how he got in. I don't know anything.

## No. And I've never fired a gun in my life, Aren't you supposed not to touch it?
Sure... but somebody always does..

## How did you meet him?
On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.

## He was a great boy for that. What else?
That's all there is.

## Want a spike in it?
No thanks.

## Bad?
Bad enough.

## Quarter after one. Why?
There's a lot of night left to live through.

## Dance? Tonight?
Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us.

## Just who are you, anyway?
You, too? My name is Betty Mayfield. I was born, and I am here. Message ends. That's what I told him. He didn't like it.

## Is this the best you can do?
At this time of night. It's not as bad as it looks.

## Why not?
Absolutely sure.

## You don't know who he is?
He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.

## Us?
All right--following me.

## Why?
No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.

## Take me home--and forget you ever saw me. That's a silly remark isn't it?
Try not talking.

## It still doesn't matter if I kiss you?
Nothing matters.

## I don't think that's on the market anymore. I'd like something much closer to the water.
It sounds like a fair location. Could you be a little more exact?

## Cant be too close for me. Right across the street from it suits me. Anything else listed?
There's another man--right outside the booth here. I never saw him Before.

## Yes. I've never been very far from it, for a long time. Will you do something for me?
Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.

## How bad is the other thing? The secret?
They'll look for you.

## But that's what I'm doing. Couldn't they think of that?
Killaine...

## Do you have to leave the note?
It's the frame on the picture. But not if you say so.

## Well?
You leave it.

## See anything?
I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.

## Cold?
Frozen.

## Wonder what?
If you're doing all this just for me.

## I guess I'm a little screwy. Maybe I could believe it. Should I try?
So that I will never be found.

## Mine?
Mitchell was dead enough.

## Who'd believe it but you? I took him out to sea and threw him in the water. Even if they find him, what connects him with me?
Magruder does.

## This is it, Betty. They'll find us again, fog or no fog.
Would I want to?

## Me?
Yes. You. You're not really a murderer yet.

## Do you think I was faking?
If I did-I don't-now.

## Beer or ale, Miss?
Ale. I don't mind.

## Who told you I was married?
There's the clear mark of a wedding ring on your finger.

## Your family coat of arms, Mr. Killaine?
Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.

## What this?
Yes.

## Where's you get it?
A graduation present.

## They're all crude, when they don't work. Had breakfast?
Care for a stroll outside? Beautiful morning. The air is like wine, the sky is a deep blue.

## FLorida?
I've never been to Florida.

## Who hasn't--one way or another?
But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.

## We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons. Was he very drunk when you last saw him?
You were there when I last saw him.

## The police always do, don't they?
You've has an experience that you don't want to talk about. An unhappy marriage, for example.

## You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
We try to be decent.

## You won't tell me who you are? You won't even give me a chance to help you?
Nobody can help me. You, least of all.

## Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
Very ridiculous.

## What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much?
They call me Jeff.

## Jeff. Shall we go now, Jeff, and get it over with?
Looking for peanuts, I suppose.

## Because you think your in love with me?
You've got a couple of hours, maybe.

## To do what?
I can't answer that.

## That's they're business. Can I drop you somewhere?
You're still a police officer, Jeff. I saw you send those two men away. I know they were watching me.

## You do things the hard way, don't you?
Sometimes.

## Morning. Any calls?
Mr. Reed would like you to call him.

## Who's Goble?
Mr. Reed, please, for Mr. Brandon. Very well. Have him call. Mr. Brandon is in his office now. Mr. Reed stepped out, Mr. Brandon.

## I'm still asking. What do you want?
I'm not sure I want anything from you. You might want something from me.

## What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were with last night. You haven't hired me yet. Mr. Brandon.

## That's a nice hard knee you've got, Goble. How'd you like to trade it for a broken neck?
Quit trying to scare me, Mr. Brandon, I'm neurotic.

## For five hundred, what do I get?
I go home and paint the kitchen.

## For two hundred?
I stick around and wait for the five hundred.

## Got the information on you?
I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's.

## Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two come together?
In the same elevator. It is a public conveyance.

## What'll you have, Margo?
Martini.

## You make friends quickly, don't you, Clark?
Sometimes.

## I'm sorry. This thing has just knocked me silly. How long do we have to wait for this police character?
Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him.

## That comedian?
All right, let's see the buzzer.

## What's a buzzer?
So you're not a cop.

## Who told you my name?
I've got good ears.

## How are your teeth getting along?
The new ones are fine. The last set I had gave me all kinds of trouble.

## What's this in favor of?
I don't like to be tailed. The lady I'm with doesn't like to be stared at. To put the matter in a couple of nutshells, I don't like you.

## What?
A private joke.

## How's life treating you?
The usual grind.

## Round of golf Saturday?
If I can get off.

## Hardly. Who's the girl?
Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name.

## Where?
On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.

## Quite sure you had no motive?
Could be.

## I rather thought so. And before that, had you ever seen the gun?
No.

## It was lying where on the balcony?
Near his right hand. About a foot away. Perhaps more. Good heavens, one doesn't use a tape measure.

## How are you two getting along?
In case you want to have us followed.

## If it doesn't take too long. Drink?
Thanks. I don't mind.

## Thanks. Lovely view you have, haven't you?
I never notice the view after the first week.

## I would. Fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap. Wonderful thing, money is. Remember what Somerset Maugham said about it ?
I wouldn't know.

## Sure. Let's discuss Betty Mayfield. How long since you saw her?
You'd be breaking the law.

## You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her. What toughened you up?
Information.

## Your concentrating too hard, Killaine. What about Margo West? She had a motive. I guess you know by this time whose gun it was?
And old man Clarendon? He had a motive, too. Margo and her money.

## How could Mitchell? After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in?
She didn't have to. He could have climbed down from here.

## You don't buy it. Okay. So I still want Betty Mayfield. Where is she?
No idea.

## You do a lot of real estate trading, Brandon?
Now and then. Mostly just for the fun of it.

## Where did it all come from? Or is that a permissible question?
I had a father who knew how to steal.

## What?
You asked me where it all came from.

## Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?
The liquors lovely. The rest of the party you can have.

## Lay off what? This is my new girl friend. Met her on the train. She's very fond of me. Love at first sight. Wasn't it, baby?
Do me a favor, Mitchell. Find yourself a nice secluded park bench.

## Did I do something wrong?
I wouldn't know. Just do it somewhere else. There is such a thing as good manners.

## Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
You don't throw guests out, Brandon.

## A little something on account perhaps?
Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.

## What are you doing here?
I don't think you locked your door.

## Passkey?
Don't be a fool. I loved him. He wasn't worth it, but I loved him.

## Convenient, isn't it?
One of these days, you're going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you've cut your throat.

## With what motive?
Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him--and I know why.

## Mr. Clarendon, have you ever seen this before?
I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..

## Floater?
Not a floater. Only just dead.

## Got a moment, Inspector?
I've got a year. Or a second. I'm not sure which.

## Would you?
If you're asking my opinion, no. I'd read it to Greer over the phone. Ask him if he had any objections.

## Thanks, Inspector. What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?
Men like you don't need orders.

## What's the face for, Driscoll?
We don't need him.

## The joint's not open, Mac. Who's Brandon?
I have an appointment with him, right here, right now.

## Mr. Brandon couldn't be here. He might have left something for you. What would it look like?
One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed. Not too fat- not too thin.

## What do I get for it?
You get it's brother.

## You in charge here?
So it seems Sergeant.

## So the shell ought to have gone over?
Unless the gun was slanted up.

## There wasn't any motive...let's try out the act.
Not too hard, is it?

## Was that about the right angle?
I think so.

## Where's the shell?
Should be over there.

## You've got a dead man on your hands. You killed jim--even if it wasn't murder. What are you going to do about it?
If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters.

## Do I know who lives down there?
You can find out.

## Do I know that she's out of the room? Likely to be out of it for some time?
You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.

## Pretty big chance, huh?
You've got a dead man on your hands. Like this.

## So?
I've got to find a way to handle it, openly. Like Brandon.

## Did we ever really think it was suicide?
And a motive--which we haven't got. So this could all be a dream.

## Oh, the Coldstream Guards. Don't you take your hat off in elevators?
I never wear a hat. Oh, so I am. I forgot. I guess I'm terribly sorry again, Mrs. West.

## May you what?
Oh nothing.

## Are you always this witty?
Scotch and plain water, I think.

## What about me?
Not quiet yet.

## I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?
Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.

## Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.

## Remember that time, didn't I? Good morning Mrs. West. Does your visit here mean you've changed your mind?
How did you know? Clarendon. You cops never tell anybody anything, do you.

## You didn't play it for laughs last night.
That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?

## Did you ever have a serious operation?
Mortar shells are not funny, either.

## Now, you're being beastly.
It does. May I go now?

## And if you didn't believe me?
I'm interested in who handled it.

## How about Magruder?
He checks too.

## Mayfield? She fit into this?
She might.

## The card says so, doesn't it?
Brandon handled the money envelope.

## I've explained the situation to Mr. Mitchell up to a point. Now about this Mayfield girl?
She's a suspect, naturally. But not the only one.

## Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.

## It won't look pretty good on your record, Killaine. Where's the girl now?
I don't know, sir.

## Well, find out. Who's covering her?
Nobody's covering her, I detached the officer assigned to that duty.

## Ye have, have ye?
We lifted seven fairly good prints from Miss Mayfield's toilet articles. Washington ought to teletype us within a few hours.

## And in the meantime this girl goes where she pleases, does what she pleases?
Yes, sir.

## With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?
So-so.

## Who's the girl?
Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.

## Why should I mind?
You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.

## Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
You ought to know why.

## You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
I have a rough idea.

## What'll we do about it, Margo?
I've always been a heel. I guess I always will be.

## Years, why?
It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.

## Oh, forget it. Clark Brandon's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening. Take me?
Of course.

## How about your new friend?
I told you she's just..

## A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again. Be back in an hour. Right?
Right.

## He's a little unhappy. I hope he wasn't a nuisance?
Yes.

## My husband apologises for not joining us. It's not too cold for you, Mr. Penfield?
It's fine, thank you.

## Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?
Please do. I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.

## Shall we go?
Yes.

## What went wrong?
Thank you.

## That doesn't matter. As long as we can get our message through to someone there. Jill, where are those handouts?
Very good.

## Working hard on that book I was telling you about. Coming to the meeting?
I'm not sure I can face it.

## How's Mary?
She's fine. Well, actually we've broken up. It's all over.

## No. That's terrible, Charles. What happened?
Look, I'd rather you didn't ask me questions. I can't talk about it.

## Attributed?
Of course.

## Why, is there a new Foreign Secretary? Who was the old one anyway?
It needn't concern you, Edward. James has got some news. He needs a poet's advice.

## Congratulations. Who with?
A glamorous young lady way above his station...

## Are you going to have coffee?
Yes, please.

## And you'll join me in a sambucca?
Thank you.

## Can I give you a lift?
No, it's all right. I can get a cab. Night night.

## What did you think of that Wadja film?
I quite liked it. I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.

## Too bad. What did your father do?
My real father? Well, he was a flashback.

## Oh yes?
How nice.

## Who?
I called you a taxi.

## Again?
Yes, if you like. Call me at work.

## Why not stay?
I have to be up early.

## I think we're ready now, thank you. And how was Norfolk? Did you get on with my mother?
I think she liked me.

## Did she talk about me?
No. We talked about history, and Siberian Geese.

## Do you think she's invited you up for her sake or for mine?
I haven't really thought about it.

## Look, will you come on a walk with me tomorrow?
I might.

## Might?
He's making plans for Brighton. He thought we could travel down together.

## Shall we have a drink or something?
Oh ... excuse me. There's Nicholas.

## Not yet you know any of these people?
Nonsense.

## You've really got it all worked out, haven't you?
No need to thank me, if you don't want to. Just pay for these drinks.

## Hold those rights.
What have you been up to?

## Sorry. Got held up. What are you doing here?
Delivering gossip and goodwill. It seems we'll both be doing Brighton. Perhaps you should come too.

## Will it be fun?
Perhaps I will, then.

## Still in love?
I'm not sure.

## Six onion bajees! Great girl. Did you shake the mother off?
Yes, finally.

## Are you up to something?
Susan and I are very old friends, James.

## Why not sit down and wait?
Okay, I will.

## Have you come to talk about me?
Not at all. History.

## What period?
Suez. 1956.

## Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens?
All right.

## What about the Cromwells?
They don't count.

## So how is she?
Well, she doesn't complain much. You know what she's like. She keeps asking when you're coming...

## Now, are you going to have some more tea?
No, thanks Dad.

## What would you call it?
I dunno. Ploughman's Lunch.

## She said that?
You weren't really interested in Suez at all. Incredibly enough, you were interested in my wife.

## And you're so beautiful. What are you doing here?
We're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools. World history since 1945. Twelve programmes, lots of stock film.

## What have you got there?
You'd look naked without one.

## Promise?
Promise.

## Don't you want to walk, Tom?
No.

## And that's why you never went pro?
Two years of surgery. I missed my window. Limped through law school instead.

## Mmm. A lawyer, huh? Too bad. But at least you're surfing now. So your life's not over yet, right?
Not yet.

## You always talk like this? You're not gonna start chanting or anything are you?
No. So I was up the beach. I saw it going down. you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. That's rare in this world.

## Where?
Come with Tyler. She knows.

## Don't you gamble?
Only make bets I can't afford to lose. Only way to be 100% committed.

## So what's the biggest? Waimea?
No, Bells Beach, Australia.

## Yeah, but are you crazy enough?
Football's a man-made game. You keep score with numbers. But in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent. Just you and the wave.

## How you figure?
One shot stopping.

## Ever done this before?
Once.

## I did. What's the matter? Don't trust me?
You gotta earn trust.

## I'll take that as a yes.
We gonna jump or jerk off?

## What's this?
Insurance policy. Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah. Press play.

## Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!
I'm not armed.

## Around somewhere. Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U. What can I do for you?
You gotta tell me where she is.

## I asked them to give me a couple minutes...
Pretty radical, Johnny. Even for you. Why don't you pull it?

## Yeah? What?
Have you seen a little dog? Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing. About this big.

## Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?
There's nobody else here...

## Sir?
I take the skin off chicken.

## How was the beach?
Fine.

## Surf conditions okay?
A little mushy.

## A little mushy! You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
Babes.

## Three men dead. One of them a cop. How's that sit in your gut, Utah?
Take your hand off my shoulder right now.

## What? Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
Cole and Munoz. I'm uh... letting them run with the ball for a while.

## The shit they pull, huh?
Pappas. Angelo Pappas.

## They don't go for the vault?
Never go for the vault. They never get greedy.

## Well, what're your ideas on these guys?
So you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.

## Yeah. What's your theory?
The fucking punks are surfers.

## Sex wax? You're not into kinky shit, are you Angelo?
Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.

## Got it...
It's all balance, right? And coordination. How hard can it be?

## What, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car?
Johnny, all I can say is we better come up with something real soon.

## Big zippo so far. How about you?
Patience hotshot. Patience. It'll be subtle, if it's here at all.

## Look, if you're gonna go leavin' your piece and your shield in the car, you can damn well stay in sight. Okay?
Okay, Dad.

## When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?
He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.

## Did that worthless punk partner of mine ever show up?
Right here, partner.

## I'm ready to rock, Angelo. Where you want me?
Got it.

## Nothing?
Shrimp and fries.

## Gimme a break. One shrimp and fries to go! Anything to drink?
I'm serious.

## Stop here. Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it?
Sure.

## Who's the girl?
Catch of the day.

## What's goin' on?
Swell's here, Johnny. Bodhi always knows.

## You had enough?
Yeah. I just want to sit out here for a minute.

## What?
I... I don't know. I can't describe what I'm feeling.

## Johnny... what's going on? I don't get it... did I do something?
No. I'm sorry. I have to go. I'll, uh... I'll call you later. I'm sorry.

## So what'd the other guy look like?
Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.

## But you look like you been in a train wreck, how'd he just drive away?
Carefully, tough guy. Very carefully.

## What do you mean?
Six others, U.S. issue jungle boots. They came in from the north, then followed the guerrillas.

## Billy... What the hell's wrong with you?
Something... in the trees...

## You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?
No way, old buddy.

## Who's our back-up on this?
No such thing, old buddy. It's a one way ticket. Once we cross that border, we're on our own.

## Mean anything to you?
Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time.

## I knew this man. Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg. What the hell were they doing in here? You got any answers for this, Dillon?
Jesus... this is inhuman. Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here.

## Why us?
Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.

## What story did you give to Davis?
She's too valuable. She's got to know their whole network. The whole set up. We take her with us.

## The wound all fused, cauterized... what the hell did this?
We're still too far in, they won't risk coming in for us.

## What the hell do you think you're doing?
We're going to need everyone.

## Now what, Dutch. You going to send your mystery guest an invitation?
No way, Dutch. I'm going. You get these people and get the hell out of here.

## What, Sergeant?
Take a position over there. I'll work around towards you. When I flush him, you nail him...

## You saw what?
I saw it.

## What's that, General?
Someone else will be going in with you.

## Mmmnnn...?
I don't think that was any ordinary army taxi...

## What's he got?
Same business, guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper... followed by men with American equipment...

## Hawkins?
I can't tell.

## What in God's name...?
I think it's Hawkins.

## Where the hell is his body?
There's no sign of it.

## How could anyone get through this, carry Blain out, right under our noses without leavin' a trace?
He knows our defenses.

## Why didn't he try to kill one of us last night?
Georgia.

## Thunder's a horse. Come on.
I dunno. Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?

## Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet? I am. This is Vivian. You two been together long? You and Edward?
No.

## Hope to be?
It's... it's not like that.

## What's that long building over there?
I talked to some developers about the land.

## What?
Mr. Kross is just getting off the phone with his stock broker. It's finished. You've won.

## Who are you going after next, sir?
Who indeed...

## If you had a... reprieve, what would do?
I... I would take advantage of it.

## How?
I... I don't know. There... there wasn't time...

## This time I imagine you would, yes. Hmm... With all this in mind, Mr. Kross, I can't logically make a formal bid on your company, can I?
You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris.

## What? You gonna tell me you're lost?
Yes.

## Great. What do I look like a tourguide?
No, you look like a hooker.

## Good. Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
Sure. For five bucks.

## Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
Sit... and spin.

## Nice car. Yours?
No.

## Stolen?
Not exactly.

## Mind if I turn on some heat?
If you can figure it out, be my guest.

## You're not from L.A., huh?
New York.

## What motel you staying at?
Hotel.

## Okay, what hotel?
Regent Beverly Wilshire. I bet you know it.

## What's your name?
What do you want it to be? Vivian, my name's Vivian.

## You like being a hooker, Vivian?
It pays.

## What do you charge for company, Vivian?
Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.

## For the whole night?
For an hour.

## Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?
You couldn't afford it.

## You know how to drive a stick?
Better believe it.

## Why?
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.

## Room service. What do you drink?
Diet coke.

## Can I have some chips?
-- and a bowl of strawberries. Thank you.

## Do you plan everything?
Always.

## Right. So! In town on business?
Uh-huh.

## And why do you say that?
I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.

## Where are they? Shopping together?
They should be. They're both good at it.

## Why?
Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.

## What do you like?
If I want you to turn me on I'll pay you three hundred. Just lay back and let me drive.

## Did you sleep well?
Yeah. Too good. I forgot where I was.

## Where'd you go?
I took the couch. I had some work to do. About last night...

## Do you ever... enjoy it?
I like guys if that's what you're asking. Not that I trust'm.

## No? Why's that?
\"Occupational hazard\".

## No shit. They expensive?
The one I'm buying this week will cost around 150 million.

## So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm?
I sell them.

## Assets are anything of value a company owns. Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole. By selling them off, I make a profit.
What? Why?

## Sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh?
Not... quite.

## Where'd you learn to do this?
Don't drown.

## What?
I'm in town until Saturday.

## Five full nights... days too?
Four thousand.

## Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay?
Three thousand for five days. And Vivian, I will let you go.

## Did you buy some clothes?
I got a dress, yeah.

## Go by yourself then. Where you taking me anyway?
The Rex.

## Any good?
I think you'll approve.

## Hello?
I thought I told you not to answer the phone.

## You're upset, huh?
Upset. No. I never get upset about business.

## Television?
Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound. You don't have to use your brain at all.

## Why not?
Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you? It works.

## Was someone rude to you?
Vivian, you belong wherever you are. I don't care how you were dressed, they were the ones who were wrong, not you.

## Come with me?
I thought maybe you'd like dinner.

## What about dinner?
Dinner can wait.

## You always been rich?
No.

## Seems like it. I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
Keep talkin'. I like hearin'.

## You still mad at'm?
He died a long time ago.

## What id we run into someone I know?
I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard.

## Shall we mingle?
Edward, these women here, I don't think any of'm like the guys they're with. They're just into it for the money.

## Would you please calm down. Tell me what happened.
Ready to stomp sod?

## Stuckey! He wants an \"appointment\" with me after you leave. You my pimp now or did he think that up on his own?
What was I supposed to do? I told the truth. Why should the truth upset you? It's not as if you're from a convent.

## Can we talk about this? Can you just try to calm down?
Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.

## Do I look okay?
Hmm... let's see... no, there's something missing.

## What's that?
I don't want you to get too excited... these are on loan... however...

## What if I lose it?
You won't.

## What if someone tries to steal it?
I'll guard them and you with my life.

## Where are you taking me!?
To meet some friends. Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...

## Huh?
The opera.

## But don't they have it in English?
Vivian, don't be afraid of what you don't know. That's the fun of it.

## Did you?
Yes. I've never enjoyed it more. Thank you.

## It wouldn't be like that. I want to get you off the street. You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?
I'm sorry. That's very sweet, Edward, and I know you mean it...

## What do you mean?
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy. Now he's beaten. And you liked him.

## The young lady staying in your room?
Thank you.

## What's up, where you going?
Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel.

## Cynthia's not coming?
No.

## Bill, we're businessmen, not the damn mafia. I'll see you in the office. By the way, about your car...
Love this car! Is it new?

## Oh, god, what?
I'll bring it back.

## Edward, did you hear me?
I'm here.

## Eight o'clock. Kross is bringing his son. Very bright kid, watch yourself with him. Who's this girl you're taking?
No one you know.

## Goddamit! Where is he getting the money to fight?
Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.

## We're letting them slide?
I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.

## Fill me in on this. How'd you and Vivian meet?
We just did.

## And you just happened to run into her. Great. What's she do? She work?
Yes...

## Doing what?
Vivian's in sales.

## Why do you want to know?
She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie.

## Industrial espionage is not ridiculous. Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
Christ, Bill, she's not a spy, she's a hooker. I picked her up off Hollywood Boulevard.

## Did I wake you?
I'm up.

## He wouldn't say. Edward... I think we got him. His nuts are on the block and we got him. You there?
Have a good day, gentlemen.

## You spent it on drugs, didn't you?
Hi, Viv. Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv.

## I just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster. I wonder how much she made tonight?
Don't be mad at me. I'll pay you back. I promise.

## No, let's go to work. Okay?
Okay. I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid.

## Why'd he want you?
He... he just does.

## I'm sorry, Viv'. Carlos has been on my back. Did you get the money up front like I taught ya'?
I'm getting dressed now. I'll be over. Bye.

## In Beverly Hills?
Yeah.

## Who did you think?
Carlos. I still owe him two hundred bucks...

## Where do you fit?
I kissed him, Kit. On the mouth.

## Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
It was great.

## All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it. I don't know what to do. What do I do, Kit?
Go for the bucks.

## So whatta' you going to do in San Francisco?
Get a job and probably go back to school. Figure out what I'm gonna be.

## What kind of school?
School, school. Regular. I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know.

## You sure you won't come with me?
And leave all this? Not in a million.

## Yeah, what?
Rent. You're late.

## You bullshittin' me?
Of rent I do not bullshit.

## What?
Housekeeping. I come to turn down the bed.

## Is that all? You just fold back the bedspread?
I also place las chocolates on the pillow.

## Thanks! Consuelo, are all rich people so lazy they can't do this on their own?
I'm just going to my room.

## You're a guest here?
I'm -- I'm with a friend.

## And who is that?
I... Edward...

## What's your name?
Vivian.

## Niece?
Of course. Naturally when Mr. Harris leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again.

## I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too. Wanna see?
That's all right. I'm sure they're quite lovely.

## Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner. The Rex. Ever been there?
It's a bit beyond my... range, shall we say.

## Yeah, mine too. Is it like, y'know, normal?
I think you'll find it normal enough.

## Will I like it?
You'll like it fine.

## What if they serve soup?
They will serve salad.

## But what if they serve soup?
Then you use your soup spoon.

## Professionally?
Barnard Thomas here. Miss Vivian, I wonder if you might come down to the front desk. There's someone here to see you.

## Me?
I'd send them up, but sadly, I don't trust the young lady to find you on her own.

## You're not accompanying him to New York?
Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world. You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.

## May I help you?
I'm just looking, thanks.

## Are you looking for something in particular?
Yes. Something... conservative.

## You have beautiful things. How much is this?
I don't think it would fit you.

## Excuse me?
I'm going to spend money.

## Would you like to try it on?
Scume me.

## Do you remember me?
No, I'm sorry, I don't.

## Having a good time, Vivian?
Yeah. Thanks.

## Then I'm here till I die?
Till they kill you. Yeah.

## Then why bother curing me?
The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.

## If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?
May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.

## Should I be?
Brides often are, I'm told.

## Who are you?
BLACK I am no one to be trifled with, that is all you ever need know.

## BLACK You admit to me you do not love your fiance?
He knows I do not love him.

## BLACK With pride. What can I do for you?
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.

## BLACK Hardly complimentary, Your Highness. Why loose your venom on me?
Nothing you can say will upset me.

## BLACK ... as ... you ... wish...
And what am I?

## Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I done?
Farm boy. Polish my horse's saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning.

## But what if something happens to you?
Hear this now, I will come for you.

## Can you move at all?
Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.

## I told you, \"I would always come for you.\" Why didn't you wait for me?
Well ... you were dead.

## Singed a bit, were you?
You? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 58.

## But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?
I myself am often surprised at life's little quirks. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 59.

## Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?
Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't think they exist...

## Oh, Westley, darling. Westley, why won't you hold me?
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.

## What?
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.

## Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?
I did that on purpose. I don't have to miss.

## BLACK I believe you -- So what happens now?
We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.

## BLACK You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people?
I could kill you now.

## BLACK Look are you just fiddling around with me or what?
I just want you to feel you're doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed.

## BLACK Why should that make such a difference?
Well ... ... you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.

## No more rhymes now, I mean it.
Who's Guilder?

## Anybody want a peanut?
I only dog paddle.

## What do I do?
Finish him, finish him. Your way.

## Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini. Which way is my way?
Probably he means no harm.

## FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?
If there are, we'll all be dead.

## Yeah?
He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.

## How many could you handle?
To find the Man in Black, obviously.

## Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body.
The Man in Black?

## Have you any money?
I have a little.

## Has it been fifteen minutes?
We can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.

## How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works?
You've been mostly dead all day.

## Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
Over the Albino, I think.

## Where did you get that?
At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice, he said I could keep it.

## What?
I hope we win...

## What is it?
Open it up.

## Has it got any sports in it?
It doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake.

## They're kissing again, do we have to hear the kissing part?
Yes.

## See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?
-- yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up.

## Who gets Humperdinck?
I don't understand.

## Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who?
Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 90.

## No! I'm okay. I'm okay. -- sit down. All right?
Okay. All right, now, let's see. Where were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of Despair.

## What? What?
No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.

## Could this be a trap?
I always think everything could be a trap -- Which is why I'm still alive.

## I could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off. You returned this Westley to his ship?
Yes.

## And our assets?
Not yet.

## Now?
Light him.

## Where's Fezzik?
I thought he was with you.

## Hah?
We're really in a terrible rush.

## Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?
Sixty-five.

## What's that?
True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that.

## Slow going?
BLACK Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.

## I do not suppose you could speed things up?
BLACK That does put a damper on our relationship.

## You don't know any way you'll trust me?
BLACK Nothing comes to mind.

## BLACK You've done nothing but study swordplay?
BLACK Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.

## You are ready, then?
BLACK Whether I am or not, you've been more than fair. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 30.

## BLACK Then why are you smiling?
Because I know something you don't know.

## BLACK And what is that?
No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.

## I'm afraid so -- I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains.
What?

## Let me put it this way, have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?
BLACK Yes.

## For the Princess?
I accept.

## Wait till I get going! Where was I?
An hour.

## Bye.
Think it'll work?

## You feeling any better?
A little bit.

## What?
Your grandfather's here.

## Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick?
You are sick, that's why he's here.

## Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
Please, please, that's what we're here for. Be careful, that hurt.

## Ooooooops.
What are you saying?

## Who are you? What do you want? Why are you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak! Why don't you speak?
Scared. Can't talk.

## Then account for yourself! Do you believe in God? Do you believe in gold? Why are you looking up old lady's dresses? Bit of a pervert, eh?
But sir, I'm not condem ...

## I assume you are making those cartoon noises to attract my attention. Am I correct in my assumption, you fish-faced enemy of the people?
I have hurt your feelings.

## Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?
Go! You have fifty-eight seconds.

## What is that? A handkerchief?
It's nothing ... nothing.

## They come here. They all come here. How do they find me?
Mr. Bialystock ...

## Yes, Prince Mishkin, what can we do for you?
This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.

## I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop. What difference does it make?
It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud. If they found out, you could go to prison.

## Oh, it's all right ... wha?
Nothing. Nothing. Do it. Do it.

## Yes, what?
What you were saying. Keep talking.

## What was I saying?
You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.

## Well, it's very easy. You simply raise more money than you really need.
You keep saying that, but you don't tell me how. How could a producer make more money with a flop than with a hit?

## What do you mean?
You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.

## What did I do?
You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.

## Exactly. And how long did it run?
One night.

## But what if the play was a hit?
Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!! So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.

## What?
I'm hysterical. I'm having hysterics. I'm hysterical. I can't stop. When I get like this, I can't stop. I'm hysterical.

## Okay. I'm way over here. Is that better?
It's a little better, but you still look angry.

## Well, you know what they say, \"Smile and the world smiles with you.\" Heh, heh. The man should be in a straight jacket. Feeling better?
They certainly do. They certainly do. Come, let me take you to lunch.

## Well, Max, I don't know, Max. What do you think, Max?
Let me see ... it's such a beautiful day. Why waste it indoors. I've got it! Let's go to Coney Island! We'll lunch at the sea shore.

## Nonsense! As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?
I don't know. Let's see. We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.

## Everybody's a big shot. Well, Leo, are you having a good time?
I don't know. I think so. I feel very strange.

## Max, what is it? What are you doing? What's happening?
You found a flop!

## Who wrote it?
Max, I don't want to take any Siegfried Oath. I don't know what it is, but I don't want to take it. We might end up in the German Army.

## There it is... in red and white! \"Springtime For Hitler,\" signed, sealed and delivered. What's the matter with you?
Look, I'm just not wearing this arm band. I don't care how big the deal is.

## Leo, what if this play is a hit?
Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of Bialystock and Bloom.

## What are you doing?
I'm going to buy a toy. I worked very, very hard and I think I deserve a toy.

## What is she gonna do here?
I'll show you. Ulla, go to work.

## Roger De Bris. Roger De Bris. Oh yes, the director. Is he good... I mean bad?
Roger De Bris is the worst director that ever lived.

## Do you think he'll take the job?
Only if we ask him.

## Well, it's... uh... it's nice and long... I mean, it's... uh... uh... where do you keep your wallet?
So much for Nutsy Fagin.

## No way out. No way out. What? Who?
The majority. The majority. Yes. Let's hear from the majority.

## What are you doing with those books? Where are you going?
Max, I...

## What is it?
Well, I... Well, it's just that... I'm sorry I called you fat, fat, fat.

## I vas never a member of the Nazi party. I am not responsible. I only followed orders. Who are you?
Mr. Liebkind, wait. You don't understand.

## My play? You mean, \"Springtime For ... \" you know who?
Yes.

## Vat about it?
We loved it. We thought it was a masterpiece. That's why we're here. We want to produce it on Broadway.

## You're not, as you Americans say, dragging my leg, are you?
I vas vit him a great deal, you know.

## No kidding?
Really, I never dreamed ...

## It was the same thing in Germany. We looked for years before we found the right Hitler.
Wait. No. How do I know I can trust you? How do I know you vill present this play in the manner and spirit in vhich it vas conceived?

## Vaaaat?
Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a man of his time. This is a man of his time.

## Never mind. Listen. Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer. Why?
It's that LSD und his verdampter babies!...

## I can't. I can't do it. It's a demon. It's a gargoyle, it's a monster... but it's still my child.
You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?

## Do you need us?
Of course I need you. It's dark in there.

## We make love?
No! No! We don't make love. Go to work.

## LADY Feeling better?
Wait. Wait. We can't play today. I have too many appointments.

## LADY We can't play today?
Thursday. Thursday. We'll play Thursday. We'll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.

## Vat?
People can hear you.

## I need it. How'm I gonna find the fuse?
Oh, ve come vit you. All for one and all in the light.

## What have you done, LSD?
Six months, I'm out on probation, but it's cool now, baby.

## What do you do best?
Send for Goebbels.

## What did you tell the people?
I told them we invaded England.

## Hey, baby, that's good! How'd we come out?
We won.

## I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use. This used to be the main highway. Want to register, please?
Sit down. I don't want to trouble you, just want to ask...

## You out to buy a motel?
No.

## Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days... What was it you wanted to ask?
I didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble.

## We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area... Did she stop here?
No. No one has stopped here in weeks...

## Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman.

## What?
You thought no one has stopped here in weeks. Now, try to remember if this girl...

## How early?
Very early. Dawn.

## Of which morning?
The following morning. Sunday.

## No one met her?
No.

## She didn't call anyone? Even locally?
No.

## You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
No! Of all...

## What do you mean?
You said she was sitting \"back there,\" or standing rather...

## What?
Cash or check? For the cabin...

## Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant?
Look, if you won't believe me, go ahead. You can help me make beds if you like. Come on.

## Anyone at home?
I live there. Alone.

## If this girl Mary Crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you?
Of course not.

## That's all right. maybe she could have fooled me. But... She didn't fool my mother.
If she paid you well?

## Your mother met her? Can I talk to your mother?
No. I told you, she's confined...

## All right! Might save me a lot of leg-work if I could just talk to your mother. But I'd need a warrant for that, won't I?
Let's all talk about Mary.

## What's your interest?
Money.

## Why?
Must've needed it.

## What are you talking about? What is this?
Did you check in Phoenix... hospitals... maybe she had an accident... a hold-up...

## I don't believe it. Do you?
I don't know.

## Someone has seen her. Someone always sees a girl with forty thousand dollars. She is your girl friend, isn't she?
Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. It was all in cash...

## You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over? You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?
Of course not. Please.

## Aha! Always got time to argue money, huh...?
All right.

## But what? Is there anything so terribly wrong about... making a decision and wanting to hurry? Do you think I've stolen... my car?
No, M'am. I was only about to say, I've sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test... that's all.

## Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch?
Aren't you going to take the pills? They'll knock that headache out.

## Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...

## How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
Yes.

## A lot?
Forty thousand dollars.

## Did he say anything about my sister?
Just what he told your detective.

## May I talk to you?
Sure...

## Is something wrong?
I want to know if my sister is here.

## Here?
With you.

## Where?
I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.

## No. I take it you don't either? How long?
Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.

## And you thought she'd come up here, to me? If she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?
Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.

## What thing could we be in together?
I hate tears.

## Is Mary... in trouble?
Yes.

## Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
Not that kind... You men and your egos.

## It was her boss' idea not to report it to the police?
No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.

## I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.
She haven't even called you?

## You want me to stay here?
She'll need both of us.

## Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound. Ever notice, Lila?
Sam. He said an hour. Or less.

## He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.

## Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
I feel better when you feel better.

## Where's the old highway?
Yes.

## Sam! Why call when we can go?
And maybe pass Arbogast on the road? Thanks.

## Why can't I go out there with you?
I don't know... One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.

## Just wait here?
Contemplate your... panic button.

## He didn't come back here?
Sam.

## Where could he have gone?
Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...

## Without calling me?
In a hurry.

## Who's he?
He's the Deputy Sheriff around here.

## Well?
Nothing. Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.

## Where'd you go to college?
She was willing to lick the stamps.

## Huh?
She always tries to be proper.

## You going to wait here for me?
I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...

## I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting?
Someone was at that window. I saw the curtain move.

## I know. Do you think if something happened, it happened there?
How could we prove... Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...

## What is it?
That's proof Mary was here! It would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to...

## You can't go up there.
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?

## Why not?
Bates.

## It's regular. Okay?
I could stand something regular.

## What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?
We could laze around here a while longer.

## Okay. What do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters?
I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.

## Can you?
Sure. It's like laughing through a broken jaw, but...

## Don't miss your plane.
Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?

## Hey, we can leave together can't we?
I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.

## You have a vacancy?
We have twelve vacancies. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies. They moved away the highway.

## Am I that close to Fairvale?
Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.

## I have?
There's no name for it... But it's something that, that puts a person at ease.

## You're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner, are you?
No.

## Don't worry about it. But as long as you've made us supper, we may as well eat it. Huh?
You're very... kind.

## Is your time so empty?
Oh, no! I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing.

## Friends? Who needs friends. A boy's best friend is his mother. You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
Only my share.

## Why do you ask that?
Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.

## To a private island, like you?
No, not like me.

## You're not going to... to your room already?
I'm very tired. And I'll have a long drive tomorrow. All the way back to Phoenix.

## Phoenix?
I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out. Before it's too late for me, too.

## You slept here all night?
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...

## I didn't intend to sleep all night! I just pulled over... have I broken any laws?
No, m'am.

## Of course not! Am I acting as if... something's wrong?
Frankly, yes.

## Is there?
Please.

## Oh?
Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering you...

## Mary is Lila's sister?
Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...

## He's already been.
You mean that old woman I saw sittin' in the window wasn't Norman Bates' mother?

## At this hour?
Recluse. Kinder word.

## He told you he wasn't coming right back cause he wanted to question Norman Bates' mother, right?
I helped Norman pick out the dress she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.

## Have you two had breakfast?
Just coming up to ring for you.

## Better sign in first, hasn't we?
It isn't necessary.

## Looking for me?
Yes, matter of fact. The wife's taking a nap and... I can never keep quiet enough for her... so I thought I'd look you up and... talk.

## Satisfied with your cabin?
Fine.

## I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I?
Yes.

## I didn't think so.
And now that your mother's dead?

## You look frightened. Have I been saying something frightening?
I don't know what you've been saying.

## Mother, please...
I've been talking about your mother... about your motel. How are you going to do it?

## And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?
Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...

## They thought she'd be coming to me.
Shut up! Shut up!

## Left Phoenix under her own steam?
Yes.

## From what?
Everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police.

## Explains the private detective. He traced her to the Bates place. What'd he exactly say when he called you?
He was out when I was there. If he's back he probably isn't even in bed yet.

## Was that all?
This detective was out there and Norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away.

## Now wait a minute, Sam. You sure you saw an old woman?
Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me.

## Did I?
That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.

## What--special autopsy?
Imagine--she was alive. What a horror. Could have been buried alive. She must have run away from the morgue.

## You mean he doesn't work for you?
No, not exactly. Why the great anxiety? It must be something important.

## So--friendly or otherwise--?
 At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.

## Then you knew of the inheritance?
Sure--I have one little job to accomplish, then we can leave together. No doubt you are surprised at this disguise.

## Who are you? What is your name?
I don't know, .

## What made you steal? Are you hungry?
No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money.

## Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
You--a friend to me?

## I know I am. Why, I even heard a shot up there last night.
Dr. Meirschultz, too?

## Why didn't you notify the police?
I understand from your neighbors that all  cats are making noise at night. Dr. Meirschultz has put in a complaint.

##  How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
Yeah--thousands, and right in my back yard.

## Thousands?
Sure, got thousand cats, too. Look at 'em-- Points to cages of cats.

## What' s the idea ?
Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business.

## By the way--did you hear a shot last night?
I'm detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell you a bit of news.

## By the way, where is your assistant?
Oh, Maxwell? He's left.

## Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
So--that's it. Buckley took the body.

## Yes indeed. He has been a difficult have him in custody--you have him haven't you?
Oh, yes, he's in good hands now.

## Do you have many patients, doctor?
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.

## What's down there?
Oh, just the basement. Some day I intend to build an experimental laboratory down there. It will save me from intrusion.

## Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it?
Oh, nothing. He is crazy, that's all. I had a little trouble with him.

## What's that?
Oh, nothing. A cou- ple of my patients having a little argument.

## He isn't here.
Man, you're crazy. What kind of a place is this?

## What are you going to do?
I'm going to call the police.

## Oh, so you feel that way too . Motions to other room. Stay in there--I'll call you when needed.
How? What can I do?

## Nonsense! ... It's here! ... Your blood ...
What is it?

## What were you dreaming about?
A voice ...

## That spoke to you?
That called ... commanded ...

## Did you hear?
Yes, the child ...

## I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?
I wish you wouldn't be so sarcastic about Ralph. He's the sweetest kid I know.

## What are you laughing at?
I just had a picture of you telling a landlady some day that you didn't have the rent, but Ralph is awful sweet.

## I don't have any affairs. What do you mean?
I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.

## But what about lunch?
I'll have it for supper. So long.

## Why didn't you eat last night?
Ouch! Eat? You can do a solo if you don't step on it. I'm going to bow out on you.

## You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?
No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune.

## Disappoint me? Why, what do you mean, dear?
Well, you see, the old chap is pretty anxious to open on schedule. All of his advertising announced the opening tonight.

## Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
I'm not quarreling, only ...

## So that's the way it is?
That's the way I feel about it.

## Hello, Express. What's the idea, trying to outsmart the police?
I'm not kidding. Joan Gale's body is packed in the box in the basement, and I saw the most horrible thing down there.

## Are you giving me this straight?
Don't take my word for it. Get down there yourself and give a look.

## What do you think I am?
Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.

## As I live and breathe and wear spats ... the prince.
You mean he was colored?

## Yeah. Have a pleasant vacation?
Charming. More delightful people crippled.

## Meaning what?
I'm through clowning. You're all washed up. Get out!

## Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.

## Which one is me? The horse?
Get out of here.

## Come in, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?
I used to be married to one.

## What do you mean?
That dear, innocent Judge Ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in South America.

## No kiddin'?
Almost certain.

## You here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness?
This one's a story, but I'm not going to tell you what it is. Every time I tell you anything it goes haywire.

## Was there any art on Judge Ramsey?
Yes, you could. Cut out this rotten business and act like a lady. Marry me.

## Don't remember what day that was, do you?
No, sir. About three months ago.

## You didn't happen to be going to Worth's place, did you?
No, sir, I'm sure it wasn't there.

## I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog. Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.
You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn't there?

## I've got a story for you. You know the Joan Gale girl?
That's the one.

## They don't suspect him?
Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.

## What does that prove?
Hotcha! Saved, one job!

## Don't give this to anybody else, will you?
It's all yours.

## Where'd you get the stag hound?
He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.

## Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?
No. I wanted to do it without saying anything. I think he's worth it.

## Cry-baby?
They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.

## I see. Was that all she said?
We planned a trip for her. I was going to send her to Bermuda.

## You weren't going with her?
No. Why didn't I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy.

## Who'd steal her body?
That's what they're going to ask you.

## Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?
I told you I didn't want to mix in it.

## Please. I'm sorry. I'll see it through. What do you want me to do?
I told you what to do. Drive around the corner out of sight of the house. I want to get a closer look at the place.

## Why?
You go in for dangerous things.

## How much money have you got?
Heaven knows. A lot.

## You will have won the undying gratitude of us all. Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back.

## Is that a fact?
Fire insurance!

## A fire! Is this your idea of humor, my friend?
And they are welcome to them. To perpetuate such creatures is to celebrate their crimes.

## If my curiosity is not too great, would you mind telling me what manner of animal this is you are designing?
One of the maids-in-waiting for that Elizabethan group.

## That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?
Everything, my friend. And you hope to be a great sculptor -- A great sculptor. Look -- this forearm is at least two inches too long.

## Have you got it? Is it completed?
Yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- I'll need help.

## Shall we unpack it?
Yes.

## What are you laughing at?
He can't hear you.

## You taking any medication?
Dad...

## Two, what if I didn't miss?
You did.

## Excuse me?
What was her name? The one I met.

## Mia...?
Yes....

## Could we go somewhere?
I'm heading out of town.

## What?
I could go out of town.

## Where to?
A place you've never been.

## Why am I doing this?
It's an experiment.

## What universe are you in, Paul?
A quantum one.

## Of what?
God. I dunno. The eternal nothingness. Mia.

## What did it want?
That's what it asked me. \"What do you want?\" I didn't answer. I was in the middle of an experiment.

## Like now?
No. I didn't. I'm listening.

## Why?
So I can move on. You too.

## Is Rose here?
She must have gone out for a walk with the children.

## Where is she?
I said she isn't here. NOW you go home. Be a nice boy and go home.

## Rose, who were those scoundrels in Birmingham?
Nobody.

## But who were they?
They were just bad men, that's all.

## In what sense were they bad?
Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.

## Was that what they tried to do? Was that why Daddy gave you the job, to save you from those scoundrels?
Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll say that. He's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world.

## What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
There was this old man that ate his niece.

## Buddy, I am wandering in a wilderness, lost. I just feel awful. Do you mind if I get in bed with you for a little while?
Well, all right.

## But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen?
Hmmm, it's soft. It's awful soft.

## What did you expect?
Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.

## Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like?
Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things.

## Just for a second. Please, Rose, what's the harm?
Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.

## Well, are you satisfied now? Can we just lie and talk, huh?
Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.

## Who would want to do such a thing as that?
Well, some fiend might.

## Why, Buddy, shut your mouth! What an awful thing to say, and where did you get any such idea as that, anyhow?
I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.

## Buddy, you're just a child.
Yeah, but satisfaction brought him back. Can I?

## I'm thirteen. And I have a natural curiosity. It's only nature, Rose, that's all. Now what's wrong with nature, huh?
Well, nothin'.

## Am I hurting you?
No. No, you're not hurting me. But I think you better quit it.

## Buddy, you wouldn't tell nobody, would you?
Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.

## I have a knack for designing clothes. But I had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook.
You're going to get yourself up and go out?

## Did your Momma really give you castor oil?
Yeah.

## He did?
Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.

## He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?
Yeah, I'd believe it.

## Hi, Buddy. How's my sweetheart who never told on me when I was bad?
Okay.

## Take a little walk with me, huh?
They're dumb things. I got tired of them.

## How did the rabbits kill him?
Well, that doctor said you got protein somewhere and I guess he was right.

## What was your mother like?
Rose is madly in love with Daddy...

## Reading dirty comic bocks. And you admitted it?
Well, yeah.

## I never saw anything like it. How did she pick him up so fast?
I don't know.

## What do you think, Brother?
I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.

## But how would you find him?
No, she hasn't. I think I hear a car.

## Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her?
You mean confirmed, Mother. I didn't confirm it before. I would have had to confirm it previously, in order for it to be reconfirmed.

## Mother, cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil?
I said ahhh-dam stuff.

## Children, children! Be quiet, all of you! The vibrations in this house are strange today. Where's Rose, anyhow?
She's getting herself up to go out.

## What'd you say, Brother?
She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.

## Daddy says Rose is calm as lettuce. Do you believe that, Doll?
No.

## She's watching the car again?
Yeah.

## I can't see. What are they doing, what's happening?
They're discussing it.

## What are they doing?
Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.

## What are they doing, Doll?
He kissed her.

## Is that all?
He had his hand on her titty.

## What is Rose going to do? Where can she go?
Mother is struggling desperately. In fact she's fighting like a tiger. But I don't know, it's close, it's mighty close.

## Buddy... does Rose really... \"do it\" with all those boys and men?
Doll, don't ask childish questions.

## What's goin' on?
Rose says she's goin' to have a baby and she sure looks it, but I don't think so.

## Why is it taking so long?
Here comes Daddy.

## About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son. Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?
It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.

## Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
Yeah, they're in the snow.

## Are they polar bears, too?
Good God, the way you live here. This place hasn't been dusted since Mother died. Look at that goddamned refrigerator.

## What's all this about Rose? What do you mean, you heard from her in a manner of speaking?
Oh, I heard from her, I got a letter from her, she's fine. But there is some sad news.

## What sad news? Did her cancer come back?
Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.

## Is her husband sick or something?
The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.

## Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C.

## All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?
No, son, she is dead.

## Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she died?
I'm not blubbering.

## Well, it's a disaster. I don't know what to say, Doctor, I am floored. How dangerous is the operation?
Any major operation is dangerous. However, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl.

## Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
Please do.

## How goes it, darlin'?
Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.

## What do you think of her, honey?
Turn up your hearing aid.

## What?
Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.

## Oh. Did you say something?
I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.

## What's the matter, hon? Is anything wrong?
No, darlin'. Just that damnable insomnia in reverse. I sleep like a baby for an hour then I'm wide awake. You go back to sleep.

## You're not having lunch?
Rose, you and Brother wait in the car. I want to speak for a moment Lo Mr. Hillyer.

## What time is it?
Quarter of twelve.

## Is she all right?
I don't see any bruises or broken bones.

## Why shouldn't she go out and have boyfriends?
No reason at all, darlin'.

## Well, time will tell, won't it?
Yes, darlin', time will tell.

## I don't intend to fire her, darlin'.
Boys? You say to me boys?

## It isn't her fault if she's popular... what?
I said I don't intend to fire her. I just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth, that's all.

## Excuse me, sir, are you calling my wife a liar?
Honey, please...

## It has been three weeks since I \"fired\" her. Is there no way to get rid of this girl? Are we stuck with her for life?
She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street.

## Her plan is obvious, plain as day. She's going on a hunger strike. The question is, how do we foil her?
She's just nervous and worried. And you would be, too, if you had no job and no place to go.

## That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear?
She already told you, she doesn't know.

## But she must know... unless... unless... Rose, was there more than one person?
Ah, ha! Hold the phone! No forwarding address, huh? In the shock of this brilliant move, I forgot something.

## Honey!
What did you forget?

## I'd say about three months. Are you satisfied?
Well, now, darlin'... give me a chance to defend myself.

## How is she?
Fine.

## Who?
You know Dave, his wife used to do dressmaking for you before she died.

## Rosebird Baby, you are the light of my life, darlin'. How did we ever get by without you?
I... I'll get the grits.

## Calm down, Rose, let's calm down and discuss it ...
Ahh-hem! Now, Rose, get off my lap. What are you doing, girl? Are you crazy?

## Is anything wrong?
No, sir.

## Got yourself up?
Yeah. I'm goin' out.

## How can the buttons stand the pressure?
There are more on the other side.

## What have you got in your hair, girl?
My rose. It's kind of like a motto. People will say, there comes Rose with her rose.

## Where do you want me to let you out, Rose?
Oh, anywhere downtown.

## You don't know where you're going?
Oh, I'll just mosey around here and there.

## Is this ill right?
It'll do just fine. Bye-bye, see you later.

## Strange voices, Rose?
Yes, sir.

## Good morning, Rose. And how do you feel today?
Wonderful. Except I can touch the place back there with my tongue, I wouldn't even know I had that tooth pulled.

## That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?
I didn't mean to bite him. He was hitting Horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and... and I bit him accidental.

## And what, may I ask, was Billy doing here?
Well, Mr. Hillyer, Billy's very poor, he don't have no money and there wasn't no place else to go.

## Well, Rose, going out to look for a job today?
What's the use, there ain't none.

## Mmm. Would you get me another half a-cup of coffee, dear?
Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job.

## I'm not cryin' because of me, I'm cryin' because of somebody else.
You mean a farm?

## What baby? What baby? What baby are you speaking about?
Mine.

## Your baby?
Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.

## All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?
Perfect, wonderful, good as I ever felt! Except for a big old scar on my stummick, I wouldn't even know I been in the hospital.

## What was it, Mr. Hillyer?
Nothing, Rose.

## Oh. Oh, God. Of course, Dave, how are you?
Well, that's interesting, Dave. I always liked Washington, it's a pretty town.

## Ha ha, course you make a lot more. What's that you got there, Buddy?
Galley proof.

## Galley what?
Page proof of a book I'm working on.

## Oh, yeah?
Well, actually, we have a little black boy named Her---t who lives in the garage. He does it for me.

## Doubted my ability all along, the little bitch. I never remarried, Buddy, you know that, don't you?
Well, no, I didn't actually.

## I don't want to start no fight with you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full of shit?
You loved her, didn't you. Well, so did I. You'll have to admit she had four husbands.

## She used to call me Mr. Right. Remember that, Buddy?
Yeah, I remember it.

## Ah-h, if you happen to run into Rose sometime... do me a favor, give her a message for me, will you?
Dave, I haven't seen Rose for years.

## What do you want me to tell her, Dave?
Oh, to hell with it, never mind. Don't tell her anything. Don't even tell her you saw me. Got to run, Buddy, I'll miss my plane.

## Yes, dear, what is it?
You mustn't be a tattletale, dear. You mustn't be Delilah-ish and Jezebel-ish toward your brother, dear.

## She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.
What's the matter with him?

## Afraid of the hospital?
Deathly afraid of it. Her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesn't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals.

## A tenant farm? Are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt?
Exactly, and that's why she couldn't possibly have come from such a farm.

## I beg your pardon, epi-zoo-tics? Do you mean \"epi-zoo-ot-tics,\" an animal epidemic?
Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a lot better, I just gave her her supper. She's almost all well now.

## Gonorrhea?
Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose, what a life she has had.

## What do you mean, what kind of gobbledygook talk is that?
Yes, go on.

## Illusions, Madam?
Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.

## Well, she finally let me look in her mouth. Is it true she's never been to a dentist?
She was raised on a poor dirt farm. I'm sure she's never seen a dentist or hardly even a doctor.

## But the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled?
Yes, and it's very bad. It probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia.

## Mother... is Rose going to die?
No, Waski, she won't die, because we are praying for her.

## What are you studying now, Mrs. Hillyer?
More history, Rose.

## Are you going to get your degree soon?
Well, I am working on my thesis.

## Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?
You're so sweet.

## Really, why don't you go sit down somewhere?
Well, you run on now.

## Rose, you're in an awful dither tonight. What's the matter with you, honey, are you sick or something?
No, ma'am, I'm just fine.

## Well, I think it's charming, Rose. But don't you think... ah, the skirt is a little tight?
Oh, no, that's the style. It's meant to be clinging.

## Poor thing. Does the ice help, Rose?
Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.

## Rose has learned her lesson, haven't you, Rose?
Yes, ma'am.

## What? Wha-at? Mrs. Hillyer?
You see, Rose? Now that's the kind of dress you ought to wear.

## Every person's got their own kinks, beef-cake. What's wrong, Kittle? You don't swing?
What Eve and I wouldn't give to meet up with you on the business end of a daisy chain.

## How much?
I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.

## You think it's that good?
I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.

## And... ?
What and? That's what I got.

## A Lincoln? What Lincoln? Lincoln Continental? Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?
Now you know what to watch for...

## Have I ever steered you wrong?
Cuff'em. Let's see what these two love birds say once they're sitting in separate cages.

## Who cares?
Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...

## If I tell you, how do I know you won't just club me and take it back?
Three hundred kilos of White Lady hidden inside a giant bust of Abraham Lincoln. A parade float.

## What... ?
Abe Lincoln...

## Hey now... what the fuck... ?
Again.

## How's your precious little school-marm today?
She's fine, as if you cared.

## Filthy kids go to kindergarten too. What are you saying, anyhow?
Nothing, I guess. Just an observation. She's really something special. You're a lucky fella.

## What'd I say?
It's the way you say it, like there's something more too it.

## What, am I supposed to read it while I drive? Keep a grip on it, alright?
You shouldn't litter.

## Well... we shouldn't rush into this, right? Let's talk about it.
What do you want me to do about it?

## What are you, Henry friggin' Kissinger all the sudden?
I'm just saying...

## All I got is being a cop. What do I do if I'm not that?
It's personal. We'll hook up at Billy-Boy's pad in an hour. See ya then.

## Remember those two uniform cops who been giving us such a hard time... ?
Yeah.

## The ones you got in that fist-fight with a couple a weeks ago... ?
Yeah.

## What's the plan?
Beats me. You got a suggestion, feel free to shout it out, genius.

## What?
The booze.

## You've never heard of Napoleon brandy, Mister Smarty-Pants? How do you think it got its name?
They... they shot me.

## What day is it?
Same day as before. I think.

## Where we going?
We're gonna rain on Zimmermann's parade.

## How you doing back there?
Feeling great.

## Why do I always have to sit in back?
It's just the way things are, kiddo.

## Wha... ?
Birth control's important.

## What... what kinda thing is that to say?
You know, the more weight back there, the faster the car goes.

## Smooth move, hot-shot.
What's mine say?

## What was I supposed to do?
Laugh it up. You'll cry later.

## What the... ?! What was that for?
Follow me.

## Where we going?
We have to find Kittle.

## Okay. But, what changed our mind?
Just keep an eye out till I get this rig up and running.

## Then, why'd we tie him up?
Who said it wa's me, hub? Anyway... he fell off a ladder. It wasn't really my fault.

## Can't you say something nice once?
Okay. It doesn't smell as bad in here as I remember it smelling.

## You plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it?
I'm waiting till the time's right.

## What about Jack Daniels? Wasn't he a decorated general in the Civil War?
No.

## Where have you been?
I'm here. That's all that counts. Watch... you'll enjoy this... it's like magic...

## You going rogue on me?
Maybe.

## We've been chasing this deal six months, and now you're gonna chuck it out the window?
He went to pick up lunch.

## No. Don't open your mouth! You honestly think you can explain this to my satisfaction?
I... I think I can... clarify...

## Well... seeing how you just suspended me, what's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard, you old fart?
Till the last firework fizzles out tonight, detective, you sit a desk. And, after that, I'll decide if you keep your shield.

## What can we do for you, officers? What new, mindless harassments have you planned this morning?
Just wanted to make you aware... before today's over, we'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you.

## Murderer? Really?
Thanks, but we don't recognize \"brunch\" as an actual meal.

## You fuckers... damn you! Why?! Why me!? Why the obsession with me?
It's our job.

## Pardon me... my mistake. Taking your thoughts in hand, huh... ?
Whoops... don't mind me. Go ahead and finish up.

## Second of all, the Declaration of Independence was all for liberty and equality, but it didn't do anything about slavery, did it?
Yeah, well... nobody's perfect. They couldn't go doing everything at once.

## Alright?
Absolutely.

## Hold your horses, sweetpea. We need Butch Cassidy alive, remember?
Can't be worse than you.

## Oh yeah?
That's right, white bread. Give it up. Right now.

## What... ? Not you too?
He's right. We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.

## Guys... all we've got is each other. Don't we know that by now?
You need a doctor.

## Any preferences?
Whatever goes bang.

## You get him?
Dead.

## If it is, that's pretty high up on the totem pole. What do you think?
Gimmie a minute.

## Been waiting long?
Just got here.

## How'd we do?
A.D. is a C.P.A.

## Come again... ?
Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public Accountant. But, that's all we got.

## You're... you're not doing what I think you're doing... ?
Seatbelts fastened, please.

## Think Zimmermann's watching?
So there's nobody around to get killed in the explosion.

## Know what I love about dynamite?
Do tell.

## You see that?
Yeah.

## Where's your pet gorilla and the female Uncle Tom?
They're... around.

## Where am I?
Jabba's palace.

## Who are you?
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.

## What is thy bidding, my Master?
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.

## What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
Wouldn't miss it.

## How are we doing?
The same as always.

## That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.

## You got her warmed?
Yeah, she's comin' up.

## Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?
All set.

## Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing. Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
Yeah, sure.

## Hey, are you awake?
Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.

## Shall we try and go around?
It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.

## What's going on?
I don't know.

## You love him, don't you?
Yes.

## Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.
Han! Chewie?

## Well, look at you, a general, huh?
Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.

## All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right?
Good luck.

## On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?
Here we go again.

## What are you telling them?
Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect. But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.

## Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.

## What did he say?
Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.

## Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?
Let's see.

## What's he saying?
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.

## What do you remember?
Just...images, really. Feelings.

## She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad. Why are you asking me all this?
I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.

## Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
Vader is here...now, on this moon.

## Your father?
There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.

## But, why must you confront him?
The Emperor has been expecting you.

## Told you, did he?
Yes.

## Unfortunate that I know the truth?
Well, I'm sorry.

## Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...

## How many languages do you speak?
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...

## Disintegrated?
You tricked me. I wouldn't have - I've never - never.

## Shush. Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
Like this. Like how? It's your fault - you're to blame. I thought it was the real thing.

## You promise you won't tell?
On my mother's grave.

## Oh dear! But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
Hmmm ... Well, I guess we will have to turn back.

## What was that bang?
We must have a blow-out.

## Oh Brad, I'm frightened. What kind of place is this?
Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.

## Say! Do any of you guys know the Madison?
Brad, please lets get out of here.

## I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly. Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
If only we hadn't made this journey. If only the car hadn't broken down. If only we were amongst friends or sane persons.

## Ssssh. Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this?
Like this - like how? It's your fault. You're to blame. I was saving myself.

## Are you - giving a party?
No. You've arrived on a rather special night. It's one of the master's affairs.

## Who's Eddie?
The delivery boy.

## ...How's the turtle food this week?
...Fine.

## And you never got the chance?
But you never had a chance to prove yourself.

## Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
...Guess.

## Would ya like a glass of water?
...No thanks.

## I had it pulled. People callin' all the time. Who needs it -- Who'd you wanna call?
I wanna let my brother know where I am.

## D'you really wanna call?
Yes, I do.

## You sure?
Yes.

## Why?
I think he might be worried.

## What's the matter? Ya don't like the room?
I don't think I belong here.

## What?
The glasses... Please.

## ...What?
Could ya take off that hat.

## Absolutely -- What time should I expect you?
Bout seven.

## Y'know how I said that stuff on television didn't bother me?
Yes.

## Like?
Sharp -- Real nice.

## Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
No... Sharp -- You look great.

## Yeah...
...Are you going to say anything to him?

## What did you say about a pet shop?
I don't want ya cleanin' nobody else's cages no more.

## Is everything all right?
I gotta go out for a while.

## ...What?
...I can't beat him.

## Apollo?
Yeah, I can't beat him.

## What're we going to do?
...I dunno.

## ...Like you?
Don't get wise with me. I want ya to stop bein' a loser.

## Why?
Paulie, it's Thanksgiving. I've gotta turkey in the oven.

## Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear?
I'll carry him 'till the third.

## No, man, it's very smart.
Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth?

## How 'bout this Billy Snow?
Fouls.

## How 'bout this Big Chuck Smith?
Joe Zack is a good prospect -- Exciting boy.

## Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?
Very high an' very fast.

## Apollo, how would you rate this last British challenger, Henry Wilcoxson?
He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.

## Where're you off to now?
Me an' my wife are goin' home 'cause we miss our children an' can't go no more time without seein' them.

## Of wa?
...Of the truck that run over your face.

## Does that bum have to say that?
I don't like ya face.

## Why?
I'm happenin'! This pig is takin' my shot -- I iz a contender. He's nothin'.

## What's ya name again?
Bob.

## That's it? -- Completely?
That's it.

## What about for food an' stuff?
You have my food in ya hand.

## Tomorrow collect from Del Rio -- He's late three weeks. How'd you do last night?
...Fine.

## Next Wednesday I grab a grand from Snyder. An' Thursday two yards from Cappoli, okay?
No, two yards from Snyder, an' a grand from Cappoli.

## You think I don't hear things?
Paulie's sister.

## Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
A few bucks.

## Does Santa Claus charge juice? Merry Christmas -- Now, how's about my present, ya gonna win?
Gonna try.

## Ya gettin 150 grand killer. Ya got any plans for it? Whatta ya think? Ya like to put it on the street, make it work for ya?
I'm gonna do somethin with it.

## Yo, you gonna show, Tony?
Where else am I gonna go. Bet three grand on Rocky.

## Rocky, do you have any representation? A manager?
Excuse me.

## What?
I wouldn't take no cheap shots. I'd be a good sparrin' partner.

## Rocky, would you be interested in fighting Apollo Creed for the Championship?
...Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate.

## Did you hear what I said?
Not spar, I'm asking whether you would be interested in fighting Creed for the championship.

## What'd you say?
...Screw you, yoyo.

## Maybe I like garbage.
Did these guys teach you to talk dirty? Huh?

## Why?
C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.

## What?
Listen, I hope ya don't --

## Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?
Yeah.

## I was talkin' with ya man, Mike. -- Hey, how come I been put outta my locker?
Dipper needed it.

## How old?
Come July, twenty-five.

## Did ya win?
Yeah, Kayo.

## ...Who'd ya fight?
Spider Rice.

## Ain't they?
Listen, I'm gonna take a steam -- Did good last night -- Shoulda seen it.

## Hey, ever think about retirin'?
...No.

## Message -- What message?
A Rep from Miles Jergens' Promotions was lookin' for ya -- They need sparrin' partners for Creed.

## When was they here?
Bout an hour ago.

## How do you mean?
I'm usta seein' ya at the gym, but seein' ya here, in my house, it's kinda outta joint.

## Whatta' those?
Turtles -- domestic turtles.

## ...What?
Ya got a good mind for dates.

## Really think so?
Ya got heart.

## Don't you care what the people will say?
...I'm doin' it for a friend.

## Whatta you get outta this?
I get the robe an' Paulie gets three grand.

## Whatta ya think that outfit cost?
God bless ya, Rock.

## How am I doin'?
Real good.

## Damn! How's it look?
Fine... That guy's great.

## Would you keep goin'?
...Yeah.

## How I look out there, Mick?
Great, kid, great.

## Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here?
It ain't your locker no more.

## Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more?
Listen, I'm with you -- But ya gotta talk to Mickey -- I put ya stuff in the bag over there.

## Bout what?
Ya sappin' his strength -- He's losin' steam.

## How's Butkus this mornin'?
Ain't had time to check 'em.

## ...What kinda dog is this again?
Bullmastiff.

## What?
Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.

## Yeah, like I was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta I need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister?
My sister's a friggin' loser.

## Tomorrow you come for some bird, right?
Absolutely...

## What kinda business?
Look at my hands -- See how the joints are swollen.

## Ya sister knows I'm comin'?
Yeah, sure -- She's very excited.

## Ya want the bird, go out in the alley an' eat the bird -- I want ya outta the house -- Enjoy ya friggin' life... Ya hungry, Rock?
Maybe ya better forget it.

## What's ya sister like to do?
Ice skate.

## Why?
Don't it matter none he's makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd break his lips.

## Help what?
Y'know, to help keep ya livin' clean.

## How ya feelin'?
...Tight.

## If ya don't pay Gazzo, ya end up hangin' on the hook, right?
Gazzo's a good man.

## Ya really like her?
Sure I like her.

## What's the attraction? I don't see it?
I dunno -- she fills gaps.

## What gaps?
She got gaps. I got gaps -- together we fill the gaps.

## You ballin' her?
Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.

## Whatta these guys want?
To see ya train.

## What can I do about it?
...People talk to me more.

## How're you preparing for this Bicentennial bout?
We can cut that out later. Apollo Creed says he'll let you stay three rounds before he puts you away.

## I'll tear his head off.
Do you feel you have a chance?

## Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?
Derogatory? Yeah, he's great.

## This is your largest payday ever -- How do you feel about it?
Feel? I dunno... Happy.

## How will you fight Apollo Creed?
Creed's great, ain't he... I'll do what I can.

## Is it true the most you've ever made in a prizefight is five hundred dollars?
Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago.

## We don't serve formula. Snookums.
And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Any comment?

## You serve martinis, doncha?
Yeah...

## Oh, a ladies man, huh?
My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.

## So what's your next move, Valiant?
Make it dry. Baby doesn't like to be wet. You're Valiant, right? The name's Baby Herman.

## I know who you are. Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
Yeah, I had to go slummin'. See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.

## So where is it then?
Somebody took it from him. That's what this whole thing's about.

## Yeah? Does he wear pants this color?
Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie. We miss you in Toontown.

## Wish I could say the same. What're you doin' here, Betty?
Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color. But I still got it, Eddie... 'Boop boop be-doop'.

## Yeah, you still got it, Betty. Who's Mr. Jocularity?
That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.

## Big on the musical comedy, huh?
Sounds like you ve never seen her, Eddie.

## You'll have it in the morning. Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
What's this, Roger?

## Is this paper even good?
Check the scrawl.

## No kiddin'? Bought the Red Cars, huh?
Bastards put him on notice.

## Do you think the rabbit did it?
I don't wanna think. I wanna drink.

## Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is?
Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.

## Oh, yeah? Well, you're not handcuffed to him. Anybody in the back room?
It's all yours.

## Can you get him out of it, Eddie?
If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.

## So what's the scam, Eddie?
Maybe Baby Herman was right. Somebody wants Acme's property. Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.

## Eddie, you still got it. Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?
Yeah, do that. I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage.

## What was that?
That was the rabbit's wife.

## The rabbit's wife? Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.

## Maroon, right?
Nope. It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.

## What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
Got me. But unless the will shows up by Friday midnight, it's theirs.

## What's that comin' from the bar?
Sounds like singin'.

## What've I got to lose? You okay, Dolores?
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.

## That'll work out just fine. When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina. How does that sound?
Familiar. Be careful, Eddie.

## Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer?
Men? They look more like weasles to me.

## Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work. The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?
Why would he contact me? I just took some lousy pictures.

## So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
Have you tried Walla Walla? Kokomo's very nice this time of year.

## Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective. What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?
Ask her...

## They?
The other people who were in here lookin' for the will. I woulda caught 'em if Cheetah here hadn't interrupted me.

## You're not takin' me to downtown Toontown?
Indeed we are. We'll continue the interrogation there.

## So you're Cloverleaf?
No one person is Cloverleaf. We're a vast company with diverse interests... gasoline, tires, automobiles.

## Come on, Doom. What would a company like that want with Toontown?
It wasn't Toontown they wanted. It was my idea of how to put the land to better use.

## What the hell's a freeway?
Not really. Only a Toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea.

## You?
That's right, me.

## Eddie? Jesus, what happened?
Toon cops worked me over.

## What am I, Earl?
You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.

## Does it hurt?
Not much. It's hard to talk.

## Last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir. Maybe that's what he was after?
Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I woulda broken into Frederick's of Hollywood. I was lookin' for Marvin Acme's will.

## Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?
Toons aren't given imperfections.

## I'm not complainin'. But give me credit. I'm the guy who took the pictures of you and Acme playin' pattycake, remember?
So altruistic.

## It's the truth. Why won't you believe it?
Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills. I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.

## If I'm as bad as you think, what's stopping me from just killing you right now?
You shot Roger.

## Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't know who I could trust.

## Where is he?
He's right here in the...

## How did you get onto Doom?
Marvin told me. Doom was after his land. Ne was afraid. That's why he brought me his will.

## So where is it?
When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.

## Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
He made me laugh.

## Now what?
Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile.

## Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?
No one knows. He bought the election a few years back. He's been rulin' Toontown ever since.

## What the hell is that?
Doom.

## How much do you know about show business, Valiant?
Only there's no business like it, no business I know.

## One too many safes dropped on his head?
Nah, that goes with the territory. He's a stunt bunny.

## So what do you want me to do?
Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.

## When will I hear from you?
As soon as is humanly possible.

## Valiant? What're you doin' here?
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.

## Maybe. Why?
Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.

## Stop what?
Valiant! You surprised me.

## You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
No... I'm not. I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.

## You got the will in there, don't ya?
I needed a place to hide. I'm in trouble, Eddie.

## Oh, yeah? Then how'd you find my house?
In other words, the whole goddamn world knows you're here! Out! Get out!

## If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit. We always run.

## Hey! What do you think you're doin'?
Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.

## Does this help?
Yeah, that's better.

## You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
Well, no, not any time. Only when it was funny.

## Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?
My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.

## How do you know that?
Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club. It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body.

## Hey, don't I get an encore?
Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you. I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.

## Just because you got 'em to laugh?
A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.

## Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?
A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.

## I think you want a drink. How about it, Judge?
Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.

## Valiant and Valiant? Who's the other Valiant?
My brother. Get inside.

## So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?
We can't do anything till it's dark.

## Say, who's this guy laughin'?
Me.

## Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
You wanna know? Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya. One of you Toons killed my brother.

## Safe?
Piano. Guy got away, disappeared into Toontown. Nobody ever saw him again.

## Wrong number?
No, it's not.

## How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
Two bits.

## Yeah?
... I'd head for Cucamonga.

## What the hell are you doin' in there?
I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots, I thought I'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.

## Yeah?
I think you oughta read it to her.

## I guess I am at that. Cigar?
By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife. She's a good lady. I'm glad you got her back.

## And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back. Think you'll keep it?
Only time will tell.

## Pretty good cigar. Where'd you get it?
From this box here...

## Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

##  Is the law on our side, if I say ay?
Quarrel sir! no, sir.

## Uh? Uh?
Then I defy you, stars! JULIET! JULIET! I will hence tonight.

## Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home to-night?
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.

## Romeo will answer it?
Any man that can write may answer a letter.

## Am I like Such a fellow?
Thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Verona.

## Is the day so young?
But new struck cuz.

## It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.

## Of love?
No, cuz, I rather weep.

## Good heart, at what?
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.

## By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine other beauties. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is; Shut up in prison, kept without my food, Whipp'd and tormented. Good day, good fellow.

## Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.

## Young Romeo is it?
Tis he.

## Are you at leisure Holy Father, now? Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter now. We must entreat the time alone.

## Benedicite! What early tounge so sweet saludeth me?
The last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.

## God pardon sin, was thou with Rosaline!?
Rosaline? My ghostly father no; I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.

## Where is my Lady's lord?
Romeo, come forth.

## Madam, in happy time what day is that?
What? Now. St. Peter's Church, and Peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride!

## What, daughter are you busy? Need you my help?
Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has need.

## I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news, I pray thee, speak.
O honey nurse, what news? Nurse?

## But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?
Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! O, my back! Other' other side,--O, my back.

## O lady dear! Are you so hot? Henceforward do your messages yourself.
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?

## Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
I have.

## Speakest thou from thy heart?
Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight! For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.

## Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.

##  Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.

## Well what shall I swear by?
Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.

## What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.

## Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?
By the hour of nine.

## Then window, let day in and let life out. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
I doubt it not. Trust me, love, all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come. Adieu.

## If love be rough with you, be rough with love; Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?

## Why, may one ask?
I dream'd a dream to-night.

## Well, what was yours?
That dreamers often lie.

## The slip, son, the slip; can you not conceive?
OH, and but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a...a blow.

## What wouldst thou have with me?
Good king of cat's, nothing but one of your nine lives.

## Is she a Capulet?
His name is Romeo, and he's a Montague; The only son of your great enemy.

## Do you have it?
Always in a rush, you are. All these years I've known you, you could never wait for anything.

## Do you really think so?
You know it is.

## Why did you do that?
It's under your seat.

## What?
As my American friend Larry would say, are you fucking deaf? It's under your seat.

## Coordinate all you want, but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me. Are we in sync on this, Vincent?
Of course.

## Is that right?
While Sam and I take out the back two cars...

## Finding this package is a thing easier said than done. We don't even know what it is. What did we steal?
I don't know.

## So where do you go from here?
I don't know. I was thinking...Maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire, that sort of thing.

## Who the fuck are you?
The name is Deirdre, and I'm running this show.

## So what's the deal?
The deal? The deal is we leave for Nice at first light.

## How do we know that?
I never did trust that blonde fuck...

## What is?
Best beer in the world known to man or God.

## Oh yeah? Whatta you drink, then?
I drink what every civilized man, woman and child in the world drinks, Guinness.

## So you thought that maybe I'd grown too attached to this charade I've been playing, is that it?
Nothing.

## What in bloody hell is going on?
They're part of the team. One of them's the guy I told you about.

## From Interpol?
That's him.

## You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head...
Good Christ! Can't you lose these jokers?

## Do I need to repeat myself?
No, Seamus. I heard you the first time.

## You were a soldier, were you?
Once.

## I feel as if I've wandered onto the set of Enter The Dragon. Could you teach me to do that?
I didn't think to see you again tonight. You were pretty pissed.

## Is that right?
That's right.

## Duty calls?
Just business.

## Now, what did we steal?
Because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us.

## Oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission?
I'm a patriate.

## Not me. You work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement.
Are you alright?

## You sure about this?
I'd stake my reputation.

## Now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we? What's your job?
Next.

## Where's the case?
There's a problem...

## Do you have the material?
You first, Edvard.

## Not so fast. Who's that?
He's company.

## There's been a slight problem.
What do you mean?

## What's that?
I take it you still want the money...

## Where's my information?
In here...

## Sit, sit... Would you like one?
Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.

## Then where is it?
I sent it to myself in Paris.

## Sent it where?
A post office box.

## Is it done?
It's done.

## How so?
I would imagine that the great satisfaction in all of this will be killing the American.

## A means to an end, is that it?
That's it.

## What are you doing?
Don't cross me...

## I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through. He's a cop?
Not exactly.

## How did you know?
If he hadn't you'd have put a bullet in his head a long time ago.

## Are you sure you won't have a drink?
No booze...Pain's in the mind, and the mind I can control. Alright, let's do it.

## You think you can stitch me up on you own?
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.

## But first you have something to take care of?
Yeah.

## Something important? A thing that cannot wait?
It gets done now or not at all. Another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can't get them.

## So this is what, a test?
Call it a reckoning of character.

## So what is it you want to know?
I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.

## Created?
Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself. And I'm not any kind of Samurai.

## Is that right?
It's been known to happen.

## Did he bring that with him?
What're you talking about, man? I don't understand.

## Who's they?
Everybody.

## Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?
I'm just worried about your health, Larry. You could stand to shed a few pounds.

## Who you calling dumb, dickless?
I ride with fat-boy...

## Where is this broad?
You should learn a little patience.

## Is that right?
It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.

## Perhaps the police?
I know cops -- and you're no cop.

## Cigarette?
No thanks.

## He trusts you to lock up?
Let's just say he knows who I am.

## Coordinate what?
Things. This is my country, you know.

## Where to?
To see a man about a thing.

## As in, they own it?
Something like that...

## And I suppose he's saying that we oughta give them something for using it, huh?
I didn't know that you spoke French.

## What'd you say to him?
I asked if we could give him anything else.

## That was a nice move you did on our young friend. Judo?
Jujitsu.

## Same thing, isn't it?
Not at all. Similar, but not the same.

## What's the difference?
One's a lot more painful than the other.

## Help yourself. Since when do you smoke?
I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.

## A cigarette? As in one? One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
I do.

## Exactly. Why not bring them?
Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB. He's smart, Gregor is.

## I've wondered that myself. None of this answers my question, though... Why bring me?
I wanted to see who you were.

## Who am I?
They certainly are. Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.

## Lovely, isn't it?
They'd have to keep something like this under lock and key in New York, and it would still get fucked up.

## What's going on?
I just wanted to see something.

## See what?
I needed to know.

## Know what?
That there was a gun pointed at me.

## But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did?
Because that's what I would have done...

## The question still remains, what do we do now?
Gregor's cell phone...

## What's going on?
I came up here to sneak a smoke.

## You were smoking?
I hope you don't mind I took your pack. It was on the table.

## I haven't. Not like that. How do you get used to it?
You don't. You just learn to live with it.

## You know one around here? Somebody you trust?
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.

## And what job is that?
It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.

## You see the bullet?
Clearly.

## You know him?
I know of him.

## The Irish representative?
Yes.

## What's this?
The address of the Russian production company. Just in case we need to find them.

## You sure your friend got the right place?
If Tony says this is it, then it's it.

## Do what?
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.

## Dark ops?
Dark operations. Wet work. Kidnaping. Assassination.

## You were behind the door?
I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to.

## You would have done that?
I would have tried not to. But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.

## How could you have done that?
Because I owe you. Look at that...

## You think?
You said it yourself, Gregor's not dead. If they had the package, they'd have killed him.

## What the fuck happened?
I don't know...

## Why are you driving? You're not French, you don't live here, you don't know these roads. Why are you driving?
I'm not here very much.

## Business keeps you on the road?
Something like that.

## If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?
In a minute.

## Do we need anything else?
Yeah. We need out fucking heads examined.

## Just like that?
What of it? Samurai pain in the ass.

## It's the one thing I've got left to hold onto. Jean-Pierre is one of your closest friends, is he not?
Closest and oldest.

## And when you finish? What then? This package, whatever it is, do you give it to the CIA? Do you really think they deserve it?
That's a good question.

## Do you have a good answer?
No, I don't.

## What?
You speak French.

## What of it?
Nothing...

## What happened to it?
Gone. Destroyed.

## What's the story?
Gaelic.

## You sure?
I'm sure.

## Why's that?
Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.

## Doing well. This is?
A friend. I was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.

## Do you have the tape?
I might know where you could get a copy.

## You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
All depends on whether you want the Russian or the Gaelic language version.

## Can you get it?
Looks like some kind of drug deal or something, they're not from around here -- one of them's still alive.

## I want to get some hounds down here.
I'd like to know what they were doing in my town! Did you get ID off any of them?

## Whatsamatter with you? Aren't you concerned about all of this?
I can't get enough of it.

## How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?
The horniest dog in Nevada.

## Cash and what?
Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two...

## Why? Are you kidding me?
No. We can't.

## It won't work.
We don't know whose money it is! They might have robbed a bank, who knows?

## Suppose someone knows about the money? They're bound to ask questions.
Why?

## What makes you so sure?
Because...I know.

## At the expense of six people.
Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?

## All right we will.
All right hold on! Lemme think... Shit, did you touch the car?

## I've got one condition.
We'll torch the bases, how's that?

## What's that?
We're going to be patient. If we start flashing money around, buying fancy cars and fancy clothes, people are going to ask questions.

## What are you thinking?
I don't know...

## Shit! We're gonna have to get rid of him. I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life. We can't risk it.
We're dead. We're dead, We are dead... What are we going to do?!

## What are you thinking?
I don't know...

## He would have done it to us, right?
Exactly. This is our little secret, partner.

## And how do you figure we do that?
All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape. We'll set him up somehow.

## We had a deal! What was I, talking to the wall?
You said that last time!

## You think he's bluffing?
No.

## You're crazy.
Well what are we supposed to do?

## How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail?
Not bad enough to kill him.

## Do you have everything?
I sure as hell hope so. Let's go.

## It was all used. Random numbers. How can they trace it?
I don't know. They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.

## We're not? How do you figure that?
We'll take the money and disappear! We can do it, spend it on the move. Even if all of it's marked, there's ways around it.

## What happened? What's Earl doing here?
He found us, he shot her...he killed her...

## Uh huh.
What are you talking about?

## And you're solid on that?
My offer? Well I'd say it's a fair one, like I said we're friends. All I want is my share, which I guess is...

## I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?
Two thousand...

## What are you proposing?
I want my share. All of it.

## How are ya?
Hello.

## No. Why?
Because someone may have gotten away.

## Could it have been in the Mercedes?
Maybe. That's where it was during Denning's last report.

## You mean that guy was an agent?
Yes. Wife and a kid. Don't blame yourself, Deputy. You did all you could. You have our deepest gratitude...and my personal thanks.

## What's that?
Denning was wearing a bug.

## Yeah? So?
It's odd. I don't know how Denning had the time, or the ability to buy something local, based on his situation.

## What for?
I gotta take some money out, that's what for.

## Has he?
No. But he would, probably.

## What's wrong?
Nothing.

## Oh. You coming by tonight?
OK.

## Are you sure you're OK?
Yeah I'm fine.

## I'm just tired is all. I'll see you tonight OK baby?
OK. I love you.

## You got me something? What's the occasion?
You deserve it is the occasion.

## Nothing happened?
Dwayne got a little tipsy is all. He doesn't handle pressure well. It's over.

## Booth. Don't. It's nothing. It's not worth it. Remember what happened the last time?
Let's not get into this again. I know him. If you said something, he'd take it out on me.

## Well, I can't let you down now, can I?
I told him I bought the lingerie, as a surprise. I don't think he suspects anything, but now you know, if he mentions it.

## How the hell did he find it?
He started digging through my closet, something he never does.

## It doesn't matter...he's next to you. You know, I always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. Why didn't you?
I used to think he was something, once... I was eighteen, I didn't know any better, and he had something steady to offer.

## A satellite dish?
Well I was just throwing out ideas...

## How are we going to do all this?
I'm going to quit. That's what has to happen first. Then we're going to tell him.

## When do you expect this inheritance stuff to be straightened out?
Shouldn't be long. A couple of weeks maybe.

## Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
It'll be more than enough. We can get out of here...

## Why does that bother you?
I'm not sure why. It's just, I've never been anywhere else...

## Sally there's a whole world out there. We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump. What are you giving up?
I don't know. My friends...

## Do you wanna tell me what that was all about?
Yeah. I want to tell you everything.

## Sally, do you love me?
You know I do.

## What did he buy?
I don't remember. We get a lot of people in here.

## Could it have been this?
Be more specific. A month, a week...

## Test the product?
Yeah.

## You didn't answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you?
You said that, I didn't.

## What?
I have a better plan.

## And what's that?
How about you give us what you have and leave.

## Am I speaking English here? How-about-you-give-us-what-you- have-and-leave?
What is this? Don't be stupid man...

## What makes you say that?
Hell, I don't know. If I had some input I'd offer it up.

## That's news to me. So it's over at Jesse's office?
Yeah. I told him I'd be there before five.

## What are you getting at?
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.

## Why would someone do that?
Because they don't want anyone to hear what's on it, obviously.

## Don't you have to be here?
Mm-hmm...

## Have you known this all along?
Well you can understand why we didn't say anything. If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.

## Is this marked money, or what?
Some of it. Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.

## What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
Not exactly. It's some lingerie store on the strip.

## Hi.
Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?

## Anything I can help you with?
Well I just uh, you know...

## Anything...specific?
Well I don't know...

## Shopping here?
No, I can't say that I have.

## C?
Yeah I'd say C...C.

## No I don't. You sure you havent seen her?
Well...I should have done a little homework, getting all the sizes, and what not.

## A lot of men come in here?
Oh yeah. Between here and Vegas we get a lot of customers. All types. Even had an officer, just like you.

## All right youre the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
No. But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and Im a busy man.

## Do you even have a girlfriend, Jesse?
Sort of.

## Jesse?
Yeah whaddya want?.

## Why?
Well, we got the DEA coming down here again, I don't know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us.

## About what?
Uh, sure. I hear you.

## Nice of you to join us. I did say three o'clock, didn't I?
Well I'm here now.

## No. Something wrong with you Dwayne?
You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.

## What's this?
I don't know...

## What are you saying?
I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.

## Nothing. Nothing's the matter. SALLY Aren't you going to tell how your day went?
Not much to tell. Nothing really happened.

## Don't you want to hear about my day?
Yeah let's hear about your day.

## Hey we're all friends, right? Friends don't squeal on friends, that's not what Jesse Segundo is all about.
Look I worked all day, I'm tired as hell and I want to sit and eat in peace! Is that asking too much?

## Then what the hell are you all about?
I'll settle for a third of that.

## True, but neither is attempted murder. In fact I'd say that's considerably worse, wouldn't you, Earl?
We're out of here.

## What?
I was on a roll! Im a little overextended now.

## Is that the mail?
Yeah.

## How's work?
Well, same ol' same ol'.

## Did they ever find out who they were?
Nope. If you're a criminal you don't carry ID, and if you do you're a damn fool.

## Are you hungry?
Yeah sure I'll grab something before I go... Hey -- I've got a surprise.

## And what happened?
Well basically I forgot about it, you know, you never win these things, but this time, well...

## This whole place?
Yeah. Figured you could have it.

## Don't you want it?
Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough. Besides, I want you to have it.

## Thank you honey. are you sure you don't want it?
Absolutely positively.

## You want to hear the good news first, or the bad news?
Give me the bad news.

## Anything in it?
Money.

## That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you?
Yeah, we did. It was unleaded, high octane.

## So...what's the good news?
That fire was set. Deliberately. And probably not by anyone found at the scene.

## No, it doesn't. Neither does his blank tape. Any news on that?
We're going to find out.

## What do you think? Heart attack?
It's nine-thirty in the morning.

## I've waited my whole life for this job, but I don't have a shot in hell of getting it. Do you know why?
Is it because of the hookers, sir? You tell them there's no crime in being lonely.

## What the hell is that?
Those are five hundred dollar chips.

## Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
No, I just assumed...

## You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right? Are you a racist?
No, sir.

## Wait.
Winner six!

## Last party all he wanted was Sting -- not one person danced. Tonight I'm doing Superfreak, I don't care what he says. Where is he?
Mr. Tan is not to be disturbed by the help.

## What? Where'd you hear that?
I got my sources.

## How'd you know?
So tell me what you know.

## I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
Yeah. We already been there. This is big, Kenny. Benjamins. Secret Service calls 'em superbills. Banks can't even tell the difference.

## What?
I knew it. The guy's name is Zing. He works at the kitchen at Reign Plaza.

## This is your ship?
That's right. I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.

## Well, I'm very tempted. It's such a beautiful yacht. What's it called?
I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht. And it's his party.

## So what's your story?
They think I'm a crooked customs agent.

## How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?
They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.

## What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
The real question is, where are the plates? If we can find the plates, we can stop the whole operation.

## Could you have your partner wait for us outside?
I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist. I got proof. See, I got a mini-bar key.

## Do you have it in you, Lee? Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?
C'mon, Lee. He's going to jail. You won, now just put the gun down.

## Oh, you American?
That's right.

## You bring American money?
Never leave home without it. Lee, this one's on me. You save your money.

## You get massage from Chinese girl before?
No. It's my first time.

## Wait a second. You're Steven Reign? You're big time. You own all them big hotels. What are you doing in Hong Kong?
I'm just in town for the weekend, taking in the sights.

## Vegas has been my town for 30 years. I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here?
You're right, you're a smart guy. Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar. But this is an even swap. Pure genius.

## Don't be messing with me, Lee. I will kick your ass. I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.
Mu-shu? You're hungry?

## That's what I'm talking about. A real Hong Kong night club. You want an Altoid?
No.

## Just relax and don't worry about a thing. I'll hook you up in there. You got condoms?
No.

## Blend in? I'm two feet taller than everyone here. Where you going?
Bathroom.

## Tread softly? Who taught you how to roost a bar?
Carter, you don't understand. These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads. Part of the most deadly gang in China.

## What'd I say?
Just follow my lead and act like a tourist.

## How you doin'?
My friend is on vacation, from America. I want to show him a good time.

## What are you doing?
She said I could pick any girl I want.

## What's wrong?
I have plenty of dates.

## Really? When's the last time you had some Mu-shu Let's hear it, Lee, when was it? Year of the rat?
Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.

## What, leave you alone so he can cap you?
I'm okay, you go.

## What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.

## Good at what?
Forget it.

## How the hell did Tan get away with it?
All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved. Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.

## What?
Come on, we still got time to order the Kosher meal. Always get the kosher meal, they bring it first.

## Why LA?
I guess you're going to have to trust me on this one.

## Follow the Rich White Man?
Almost, but you've got to say \"Rich White Man\" all run together like it's one word.

## Who?
Big hotel billionaire. He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.

## The same place you find all RichWhiteMen. Gefilte Fish. Lox and bagel. I love this stuff. Here, try it with a smear.
How do you know he's our man?

## How do you know?
Look at her. Now, wake me in an hour, I'll take over.

## You pull a muscle or something?
My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.

## I'm sorry, Lee. Why did she leave you?
It's a long story.

## Excuse me?
She's just standing around -- not doing much.

## What did you say?
Nothing. I said nothing.

## Is it hot in here?
Hot? I'm freezing my ass off.

## What's going on?
She's getting undressed.

## What's she doing?
Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...

## What?
She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg. Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.

## What is it?
No, I don't believe this shit -- it's a microphone. Lee, she's wired...

## I don't understand?
She's walking back towards the door.

## Let me see it again?
We can help you. I'm a detective in Hong Kong.

## Are you okay?
What's the first thing I told you -- never trust nobody. How could you fall for that shit? I knew she was dirty.

## Why did you help me?
It doesn't matter.

## I believe in heaven. You people believe in heaven?
Yes. We have heaven.

## What's a Chinese heaven?
I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues. They don't let everybody in.

## You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
No.

## How was the sex?
There was no sex. She was very traditional. We were waiting until we were married.

## You're kidding. No sex? Nothing? No mu-shu?
No mu-shu.

## What about a little king pao chicken?
No kung pao chicken. Never.

## Steamed dumplings?
Once in a while, steamed dumplings. But only when she was drunk.

## Are you serious?
Forget it. It doesn't matter.

## That depends. How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.

## Who's Benjamin?
Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity.

## What is Mac out?
Follow me my Asian brother.

## Lee, what the hell are you doing?
It was Isabella. She says the plates are in the soft count room.

## That your gate down there?
Yes.

## What is this?
About fifty grand. I won it at the tables.

## New York City?
First class.

## The Plaza Hotel?
A little Mu-shu.

## Some Kung-Pao?
I could use a little vacation.

## Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
What \"revenge\" is he talking about?

## No. It's a sample. You guys ever heard of the Superbill?
And Hu Li killed him for the plates.

## What's going on?
I need your help.

## Why don't you go get them?
If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.

## I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?
No. But I'll help you.

## Are you okay?
I'm fine.

## The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?
No. Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw.

## Baby Duck?
That's what we all used to call him when he was a kid -- cause he was always quacking. Never shut up.

## Do you still have the bills?
I still have my lunch money from third grade.

## Any leads?
We think it's Ricky Tan. If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.

## The Secret Service? Why?
All he wanted was some mu-shu.

## Did you tell Sterling?
Let him find out on his own. I want the Hong Kong police handling this.

## Didn't I teach you to always arch your back?
Yes, Master.

## Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...
Ricky Tan?

## STERLING Who the hell is that?
That is...Chief Inspector Lee. The detective in charge of our investigation.

## Fifty million! Are we talkin' United States dollars?
In used currency. Nothing bigger than a fifty.

## What is your name?
That's cool. We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.

## Feds asked for me?
They asked for the best street man I had.

## You have one of these?
No.

## You're full of shit. Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit?
Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.

## What?
That silly-ass look on your face.

## Where were we?
Witnesses.

## What about them?
I know a shortcut.

## He was trying to kill me, not you.
Shortcut?

## Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what? Six hours?
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.

## What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?
No. I just made it up.

## Alright, listen, no bullshit just tell me straight, did you really know the guy you were chasin'?
Yes. He was part of the Juntao crime family. He may be Juntao himself. And he dropped this.

## When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear? This is my man, you dig? My informant. You know what an informant is?
Stooly.

## What?
Took off. Yes. They took off.

## You like it?
Yeah, it's good.

## You want more?
No, no. I'm full. Too much fin and hump, you know, gives me gas. scuse me.

## No! You hate me. Look, I'm gonna do it one time. That's it.
You know War?

## Are you OK?
I got to stop that dancing in the street till all hours.

## Want some?
No, fish is a PM food.

## Excuse me?
Nobody in America eats fish in the AM. We're talking strictly an after twelve noon food type.

## Which one?
Going into the restaurant.

## What do you hear?
OK, when you go in, just act like you're from outa town.

## You drop my gun and you lose my i.d.?
I'm sorry.

## What are you doing here?
Well, I ain't goin' to China. And neither are you.

## What?
The art.

## It's Hong Kong, not Tokyo. My country asked for the best. I told them that was you. Now I will show you around my hood.
You know him?

## No shark fin, no camel hump. What you listenin' to?
Oh, I think you like this very much.

## Yeah...beautiful. What would you call that paper there? Kind of a...Robin egg blue color?
Good. That's standard military packaging for plastique. Get a look under it.

## Where'd you get it?
You're killin' me here.

## No...what?
I could get promoted right out of here.

## They put you in charge?
In Charge. Just me'n him. No interference. They don't even want to hear from us until we're done. I love the F.B.I. I love the F.B.I.

## Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.

## Jesus...what do you want?
This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find em.

## Oh my god...what happened to you?
It's called a dress.

## It's called you're gonna kill me. What're you doin' with that on?
It's okay. For restaurants.

## Yeah. So why you look do down?
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.

## How about a lift home?
Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in the front seat.

## Any demands yet?
At this point we don't have much.

## How much they want?
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.

## What kind of assignment is that?
Bottom line, I don't want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.

## Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?
Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.

## What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
Don't play bullshit games with me.

## Why don't you try the assignment. Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
Or somethin'.

## What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package?
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.

## You got a boy friend in here yet? Cause you're gonna need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye.
Do it!

## What are you talking about?
How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!

## Where do we find him?
You don't. He finds you. Through his people.

## Can I speak with her?
Yes.

## Han?
Yes.

## You have what I asked for?
I do.

## Carter, can I have a moment?
I am so sorry about your men.

## And Mr. Lee? Where is he?
Don't worry, he's with Carter.

## When were you going to tell me you were not going with us?
I still have work to do here.

## After I left?
I will not have friends in America.

## What is he up to now?
Ike just came by to check out the team.

## Bob -- are you making friends with this man?
I'm just bragging about how great you are. I'm the luckiest man alive.

## At the wedding? You invite him? Bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me?
Sure I do. But the bet defense is a good offense, right? You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.

## Let me take you back inside, okay?
Ahh.

## How about -- \"I hope you'll be very happy together\"?
You look awful.

## Really?
I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.

## Got any last minute advice?
Maintain eye contact.

## What? You talked to him! Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.

## How could I be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as God intended?
Good one! Thanks.

## I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be. But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
Of course.

## Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
Of course.

## So? I never returned your calls, even when we were married. And what's Fisher doing here anyway?
-- It's for you, Ike.

## What?
Journalism lesson number one. If you fabricate your facts, you get fired.

## Someone reliable, I'm sure. A booze- hound in a bar?
No, that's what makes you unemployed.

## See? You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
I'm sorry, Ike. This is permanent.

## Is that what I did to you? Is that what happened? Did I just not see you?
Overpriced nice apartment and Chinese takeout. That's New York living.

## Or a vegetarian?
Look, he's running after her.

## What are you trying to say to me, Fish?
Vindication. How would you like to get some? A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct.

## But I'll get my normal fee, right?
Don't say \"spec\" like it's a dirty word. Nobody ever paid Shakespeare to write a play! Plato never got a book advance...

## No, I'm paying for the dress. Do you think she's still gonna run?
I don't know.

## You're coming here?
Yeah.

## Whoa, Ike. Getting a complex, buddy?
Get this man a Kamikaze.

## Guess you'd know about that. You're an entomologist, right? How's business?
Not bad. I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.

## Why do YOU think she ran?
I don't know. I'm working on it. I was on the wrong track.

## And you defending her?
No. I call it like I see it. I'm a journalist. I'm a truth teller.

## I know. Tell me something. Do you think she's going to make it all the way this time?
Good fact. Well, you let me know.

## What?
About her upcoming wedding and all.

## I am just such a reporter. And you are?
Peggy Phleming. Not the ice skater.

## And you are?
Looking for Maggie.

## Have you listened to his morning show, \"Wake up with ballplayer\"?
Not yet. I had a phlemless morning. I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.

## Yes, I am. And who are you?
Betty Trout. Five dollars.

## Gee, I hope they don't have a fight out there. You don't think they'll call it off...?
Well, wedding cake freezes. This we know.

## Getting nervous?
Nervous? Not at all! No. I've never been more certain in my life. Except -- I am having all kinds of weird dreams.

## Weird dreams? You're going to tell me about them?
Yes.

## Did something happen to make you care about reality?
You're going to be very disappointed.

## Everest. Is that right?
Twice...

## Really?
Without oxygen...

## You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?
You can turn that finger around.

## I'm not a boastful man. What's your point?
Really.

## You've seen the post-its. I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.

## You afraid to try?
No, I'm not afraid. Just... Maybe someday.

## Now that's romantic. A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong?
I don't know.

## Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?
Even with everything that's happened I've still never been married and I still deserve a beautiful dress.

## Tell me. When you get to the altar, will you spike the bouquet?
You know, there's no...

## Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music I like and then finding me a rare album. You're not trying to soften me up, are you?
No -- I'm cleaning an attic. I wouldn't attempt the impossible.

## Can you fix it?
First I have to find some tools. I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.

## Of what?
Wrenches. My dad's gonna love that one.

## Are you all right with this? You think this is funny?
Yes.

## What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
I already explained about that.

## Brian told you that?
Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.

## What!?
No. No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor.

## About a minute...?
A little longer for me.

## Okay. So... what, uh... What just happened? Just now? Jus then? In there?
I don't know. I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.

## So, we'll...
To who? Are you asking me?

## It's something I've always wanted to do.
I've been making friends with your cat. Is it okay that I'm here?

## You actually could make breaking and entering into a new career. So, what are you doing here?
I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things.

## Does it matter?
Yes, I did.

## Used?
They're mine. I'm turning in my running shoes to you.

## I was, because if you said \"yes\" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part. And I've been practicing it. Ready?
I'm listening.

## Stop it. When you talk like that, I get turned on and it frightens me.
I borrowed it from this guy I know. So?

## She's the boss.
Reporter?

## For what reason? Some personal satisfaction?
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.

## There he is. Snoop Doggy-Dogg.
Ya think?

## Where?
Over there. Ten o'clock. He's talking to our little Dennis. Dennis will turn into one of those \"sources say\" things.

## Thank you. Do you think I flirt with Cory?
Yes.

## On anything male that moves? As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?
I'm going to kill myself.

## Why?
Because you think I'm all like... \"Hey man, check me out\".

## I think you're right. Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
Something that brings warmth to my heart. Duckbill platypus.

## Thanks. Will you fix my hair?
Lighten up, wahine.

## Lighten up, what?
This party is for you and Bob. Get your mind off the reporter.

## He's going to be the pastor?
Yep. I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.

## ... I don't even want to talk about the luau. What's this?
It's for the bell.

## Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
No, I'm just going to head home.

## What are you talking about?
Wedding. Wedding. You just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row.

## What?
Just stop it. Don't say another word like that.

## Is there somebody else?
Nope.

## You don't love me, is that it?
Nope.

## What am I going to do with a microwave?
You turn it on, you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time.

## Am I what they had in mind?
They're going to love you.

## Is that all right with you?
Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.

## I love you, Walter. Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?
Nope.

## Even when you were young?
Nope. Not even when I was young.

## You sure you don't want to drive with me?
How will I get back to Baltimore Saturday? Oh God, I forgot my present for your stepmother -- I took it inside by accident.

## We will? The Symphony? Okay. I'll take you to the Russian Tea Room for pelmeni.
Walter, I'd love to --

## What is it?
It's delicious, trust me.

## Does it have wheat in it?
I don't think so.

## Who is it?
Oh, it's just Becky, she's having trouble with Rich again. Hold on, Becky, I'm going downstairs.

## Couldn't you just do a phone interview?
Not for the kind of place I want to do. I won't be in Chicago that long.

## What?
About forever.

## Yes. But it wasn't really. It was just...
Beautiful view, isn't it?

## I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building. I'm here.
So what happened?

## You okay?
Yes. Some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony.

## About what?
Nothing's with me.

## \"Sleepless in Seattle\"?
I'm going to marry Walter. I just have to get this out of my system.

## I don't know. I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?
Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.

## And then you left him? He lost weight there and you left him?
Plus he fell in love with a temp.

## Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?
The kid is on. You've got me listening to this garbage. Go on, turn it on.

## I couldn't do it. How did I get here?
You told a lie and got on a plane.

## Is this crazy?
No. That's the weirdest part about it.

## You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
I love that dream.

## But he saw you, right?
He said hello.

## Becky?
Made for each other.

## What about the letter?
It doesn't mean anything. It was written before I went out there. Before the ho.

## What are your plans in New York?
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.

## That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go home. I quit. Laurie, I quit. I'm going back to Baltimore. How does a blonde do a high- five?
Yes.

## Hi, Jonah. Sam. And who is this?
Howard.

## I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married. So we get married.
I think I'm going crazy, Tom. I really do. Are you happily married?

## But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?
I don't even know him. But I'm having all these fantasies about a man I've never met, who lives in Seattle.

## Are his folks nice?
You'll love them. We're going down to D.C. tonight to be with them Christmas morning.

## How did it happen?
How amazing.

## What?
You know.

## What?
Magic. It was magic.

## Well, fine, fine. Fiddle da dee. And how's it working?
Like... clockwork.

## It's you.
Shhhh --

## It's me?
Grace heard it.

## Why me? What about Jay?
Thanks, but I'll pass. It's kind of a big night. I don't like to leave Jonah alone.

## Who is this?
FIELDSTONE Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.

## FIELDSTONE Good. How long ago did your wife die?
It's been about a year and a half.

## FIELDSTONE Have you had any relationship since?
No.

## FIELDSTONE And I don't want to invade your privacy --
FIELDSTONE Why not?

## FIELDSTONE Do you think there's somebody out there you could love as much as your wife? Maybe even more?
It's hard to imagine.

## FIELDSTONE What are you going to do, Sam?
I don't know. When I met my wife, it was so clear. I just knew.

## FIELDSTONE What was it that made you know?
I don't think I could really describe it.

## FIELDSTONE No last names, Jonah. Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers. How come you're up so late?
It's not that late in Seattle.

## FIELDSTONE Got me there. What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?
It's not for me. It's for my dad. I think he needs a new wife.

## FIELDSTONE You don't like the one he was now?
He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.

## FIELDSTONE Where's your mom?
She died.

## FIELDSTONE Why not?
It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff. It's like it makes him sadder.

## FIELDSTONE Is he home right now?
Yeah.

## What kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio?
Just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.

## How about rapacious and love- starved?
No.

## When's the latest time you were out there?
Seventy... eight.

## What's tira misu?
You'll find out.

## What is it?
You'll see.

## Dad, could you close the door?
H and G. Hi and goodbye.

## You think so?
It's Y. O. H.

## Yeah. What's that?
Your only hope.

## Nobody knows. It changes practically every day. How much money do you have?
Eighty dollars.

## Do you want an aisle or a window seat?
Window.

## I don't know. Do I?
There's somebody on the phone for you. His name is Sam.

## It's never happening again. Right?
Right.

## How many people do you think heard that thing last night?
Jed is having a slumber party New Year's Eve and he invited me.

## Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?
I think I know how to have a spice rack.

## How did they get our phone number?
You have to give them your phone number or they won't let you go on the air.

## \"Dear Sleepless in Seattle, I am an SWF\"-- What is that?
Somewhere in the middle.

## I'm starting to notice that.
This is not how you do it. You want this on an English muffin or a bun?

## What?
In the movies women are always scratching up guy's back and screaming and stuff. When they're having sex.

## Whose show was this on?
Jed's got cables.

## How do you know?
It was sinking.

## What was?
Our house. There was water coming in all the windows.

## I miss her. What do you think happens to someone after they die?
I don't know.

## Like do you believe in heaven?
I'm starting to forget her.

## She's going to cook something for us?
Okay, tiger. Time for bed.

## What are you doing up?
I was thirsty.

## Did you call that radio station again?
No.

## Was Mom an adjustment?
God, she's beautiful.

## Who is Annie?
The one who wrote us.

## Have you seen my wallet?
It might be in the kitchen.

## Are you going with her?
Yes.

## What's wrong with Annie?
I was scared of what you were gonna do.

## When I found you?
If I didn't go.

## Listen, have I ever done anything really stupid?
No.

## I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you?
No.

## What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?
I went camping once. I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.

## Yes?
You must be Jonah.

## Five minutes in the microwave. Any one of them, five minutes and done. Ready to eat. Do you know how to make juice?
He's over at the boat show. He'll be by later. It's so beautiful here.

## You saw her in the airport and then here?
I tried to talk to her... It was like I knew her. Weird.

## It's a little derivative.
How's Jonah taking it?

## Anyway, Victoria's nice.
What do you mean?

## Would you follow her through an airport?
Look, I met somebody. She's good, and capable and smart. We hit it off. We can't spend your life chasing after fantasies.

## I've already solved it. I've hired a hit man.
You did?

## Is he there?
Your foreman says that's a foreman's job.

## Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee?
You're welcome to one.

## Are you going to let us pass -- or do I have to call the Sheriff?
There's nothing stopping you.

## How's it going?
Not so sure about that. Letter of the Law, you know. All the injunction says is no picketing by miners.

## Whose side are you on anyway?
Now don't get excited, Mr. Alexander. They'll scatter like a covey of quail.

## Well?
I don't make policy.

## Now why don't you let these gentlemen pass? Don't you know who's in that car?
It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.

## Jenkins ain't no boss. Mean we're gonna let people like Jenkins stay here?
You can't send him back to Oklahoma. It'd be inhumane.

## How goes it?
It never ends.

## The woman question?
Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.

## So? What does he want to do about 'em?
He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.

## What do you mean -- sex equality?
You know ... What's good for the goose is good for the gander.

## Hear you had a little trouble, Quintero. Defective fuse? Well, you're all in one piece. So what's the beef?
You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.

## Who? A scab?
An American.

## Are you sick, Mama?
No, Estellita.

## Are you sad? Are we going to church? For your confession?
Later. When I finish the ironing.

## Why are they singing, Mama?
They are singing for me.

## Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
Yes. We will light the candles.

## To the mine?
Sure. Where they're negotiating. In the company office. We'll go up there and picket the place.

## I listen to it. Every night. When you're out to the beer parlor.
It isn't right, she says. Was it right that we bought this ... this instrument?

## Where you going?
Got to talk to the brothers.

## What?
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.

## What's more important than sanitation?
First we got to get equality on the job. Then we'll work on these other things. Leave it to the men.

## What has it got me, your union?
What has it got me, your union?

## Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?
I'm a fool.

## Was it expensive, the beer?
Antonio paid for it.

## What's the matter?
It's nothing. Just a little catch ...

## A fighter, huh?
He was born fighting. And born hungry.

## What were they saying? About you? In there?
They say I am no good to you.

## What makes you so sure?
Let them take it!

## Can't you see they want to start a fight so that they can lock you all up at one time?
It's not fair ... I should be there with them. After all, I'm the one who got the women the vote.

## Can be what?
Backward.

## You all right?
Sure.

## Must've been some experience for you, huh?
Yes.

## I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?
I'm going back tomorrow.

## How do you feel?
I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.

## Four nights. How did you sleep?
We raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in.

## Did you have to sign a pledge? Not to go back to the line?
No, no ... we wouldn't do it.

## A meeting?
Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.

## That meeting only lasted ten minutes. The first night I'm home, and you run to the beer parlor. What is it? Can't you bear the sight of me?
Be still ...

## Where are you going?
Hunting.

## When?
Sun up.

## Alone?
No.

## You mean you're ready to give up?
Who said anything about giving up? I'll never go back to the company on my knees. Never.

## Like what?
I don't know what you're talking about.

## You talk of dignity? After what you've been doing?
Shut up, you're talking crazy.

## This is what we've been waiting for.
Will you be still?

## What are you saying?
This means they've given up trying to break the picket line. Now we can all fight together -- all of us.

## Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?
Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.

## You mean Delaware?
No. New York.

## New York? You're not the Company President by any chance?
No ...

## Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President. But you've come out here to settle the strike?
Well, if that's possible ...

## What are you doing here? Something wrong with Mama?
I thought maybe you forgot...

## Forgot what?
She's coming. Charley Vidal gave her a lift.

## I don't want you hanging around there, hear?
Papa, can't I leave now? There's a meeting of the Junior Shop Stewards ...

## Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go.

## What attitude?
You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.

## He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.

## Are you Australian?
No.

## You got a bathroom I can use before we hit the road?
Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty. Just kinda' filthy is all.

## You mind?
No, I don't mind. That's how come I told you about it.

## Bobby?
Shhh.

## What?
The spiders.

## What can I do for you?
Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us.

## What?
Come on. Ease off the girl.

## Not even a guess?
Yeah, but he was in silhouette.

## How about in the house?
They were wearing ski masks. I told you all of this.

## What is it?
It's downright classy is what it is.

## Everything go?
Yeah.

## How?
I don't know .... you could be staking your financial future on stealing Bob Hope's stool specimen.

## What about the guy on the very bottom?
Leave me out of this.

## That bad, huh?
Could be worse. Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to.

## What?
Nothing.

## Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?
It's not that easy.

## Why not?
You don't understand.

## You get off on abuse or something?
Fuck you.

## Why don't you call the cops?
Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.

## How?
Oh. Hi.

## Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure. By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set. Where's Quincey?
Don't worry. He's out of town.

## How far out of town?
Trust me. We're safe.

## Like you?
Nah. I'm strictly minor league... except for the fucked-up part.

## And you admire that?
It's the only way to play.

## Is that how you play?
I try.

## What are you up to?
Nothing.

## I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
It gets me through the day.

## How much time do you have?
You've got a comeback for everything, don't you, Danny? You use 'em like some sort of shield.

## Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.

## What are you hiding, Danny?
Therapy session is over.

## You think you're the only one down here with a sad story?
No. But I'm the only one with my sad story. And that's how it's gonna stay.

## Who is it?
It's me.

## You always been this stubborn?
From day one. I was a breach birth. They tried for hours to turn my little butt around. But I wouldn't let 'em.

## What's wrong, Danny?
Look, maybe you oughta' leave.

## What is it?
Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.

## Why?
Don't worry about it. Just go across the street and watch. You'll know when it's safe to go back.

## How you holding up?
Can you do me a favor? This girl I know, her boyfriend's a real piece of shit-dude's really jamming her up. I promised her I'd try to help.

## Who is it?
It's Tom.

## All right, Nancy, how'd you track me down?
Billy Sutcliffe said he saw you at a bar down in Gardena a few weeks ago. Said you looked so bad, he barely recognized you.

## Closure? How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there?
I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.

## Is that what you want me to do? Put it all on Jesus? Let him sort it out in the afterlife?
You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.

## How the hell did we get this detail?
Guess it's our turn.

## Where to?
Jimmy. Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn.

## Why's that?
My features. They're Finnish.

## Was. I'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man. You got anything for me?
Sorry.

## Why does it have to feel so bad?
You're brain is in reverse mode ... cutting off your supply of dopamine. Here. Have a beer.

## So, why'd you want to see me?
Business. I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.

## What?
You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit. You got language skills, man.

## You remember that guy you told me about ... said he could handle a big hook-up?
I think so. I mean, we'd have to talk to him.

## Can you set that up?
Sure.

## Jimmy, where do you find these people?
The Del Ammo Mall mostly.

## You wanna score some go-fast?
Not tonight.

## Hey, why do you need a gun and a vest anyway?
Personal protection. It's a dangerous world we live in, Jimmy, a very dangerous world.

## Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
I think on account of his nose.

## You want a hit?
No. I'm good.

## Can I ask you something?
Sure, Jimmy.

## What does J.F.K. stand for?
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.

## Danny?
Yes, Jimmy.

## What's this?
Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare. It's for you.

## Why?
You're my best friend, man. I'd do anything for you.

## What?
I'm not a tweaker. I don't use drugs. I never had.

## No one ever noticed?
Are you kidding me? A bunch of amped -out tweakers? It was easy.

## But... why? Why would you pretend?
I can't tell you.

## You don't trust me?
I don't trust anybody.

## Wait If you don't trust me, why did you tell me that stuff about not using drugs?
I don't know... a little. I wish you would have let me in on it from the beginning.

## Nah... I want to keep it. Maybe I can use it for like, inspiration ...you know...like when I detox?
Good for you Jimmy.

## Then why don't I see any pictures Of me up there?
That was my idea.

## What does that mean?
You don't understand.

## Understand what?
I'm gonna get this developed and send it to the Warren Commission.

## I'm sorry. Would you like a taste?
No, I'm good.

## Can we talk price?
Make me an offer.

## I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.

## You're serious?
Anything for a dear friend.

## So that's 40 lbs. at 6 a pound then?
If you say so.

## Why do you say that?
I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman.

## You want to do this some other time?
Pull your pants down.

## I'm sorry?
Pull your motherfucking pants down.

## What the hell was that? Who told you I was five-0?
No one. It was just a test. I need to be sure of who I'm dealing with from time-to-time.

## Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel?
I'll keep that in mind.

## What the hell is this?
Just some buddies.

## What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?
Cool it. We got business.

## You got a name?
Bobby, rhymes with hobby.

## What?
Never mind. Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.

## No last name?
It was all pretty informal. Didn't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries.

## You think I'm a Judas?
Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.

## Don't you wonder why I do it?
The money? The drugs? Keeping yourself out of jail? I know the drill.

## You don't find that repugnant?
Just the way the world works. Look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy. You never hurt anyone but yourself as far as I know.

## Tell me what?
If he finds out it's me, I'm a dead man.

## When?
Soon. I promise. We'll get the charges dropped and you can disappear. In the mean time, trust me, he has no idea that you ratted him out.

## Question is, what are you doing here?
I was trying to score some dope.

## Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
Okay, asshole, you wanna play, we'll play.

## You think this is funny motherfucker?
I can't help it, Tanner, you hit like a fucking girl.

## This chink have a name?
Bubba.

## Did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off?
Look man, I just wanted to make some dough and disappear. I didn't want to wait around for Domingo to figure out who doubled back on him.

## Whata you mean I've got no choice?
Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...

## You think you're so god damned smart, don't you?
That's because he doesn't have one.

## What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
That's probably what he would have done if we hadn't found out about your get-rich-quick scheme.

## What? Is it bad?
I'm afraid so, Danny.

## Who is it?
That's real sweet, Garcetti. Thanks.

## Danny?
My name is Tom.

## Whatever you say, man. Look ... can we talk about this?
Yeah. Okay. Listen carefully ... You're in the bathroom. You've been shot in the shoulder ...

## Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?
I'll tell you why you didn't help - because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch. You're a bottom feader, Flynne.

## Yeah. What about him?
Turns out he's connected.

## And what does this have to do with me?
He knows somebody ratted him.

## Anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time?
We know what's going on.

## Who the hell is Jimmy?
He's the only one I told.

## What's on the other end of this thing?
Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.

## What's that smell?
That would be me.

## Hell, yes! What the hell do you expect zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler?
Who'd have thought it? Danny \"Chickenshit\" Flynne trying to go large right under our noses.

## Excuse me?
Several possession charges, but nothing major.

## Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
They have. But they never found a lab.

## Come on! Who is it? Domingo's boys?
Worse. Much worse. A teacher.

## When is the deal going down?
You know, I'm starting to think I'd rather take my chances with Domingo than go through any more of this shit.

## With you clowns watching my back? What do you think?
A virtuoso rendition. TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece.

## Really?
It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch.

## Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to? And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
Tom, quit fucking around.

## What do you mean?
Look at that place. It's creepy.

## First you want me to ask for directions, then you don't. Which is it?
I wanted you to ask back there. You know, before you got us lost.

## Just no pleasing you, is there?
Just admit you're wrong.

## We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There. You happy?
Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.

## You thinking what I'm thinking?
Yeah. This could be the one we're looking for.

## Don't we always take good care of you?
She's 57 and she's been teaching third grade for the last 33 years.

## Where's Bubba?
Maybe he isn't showing.

## What is it, drugs?
Better than drugs.

## What is that? Rum and coke?
Don't worry about it.

## I just want to be straight on the details. Can I taste it?
No, you can't taste it. It's the fucking lab! Now shut up.

## Resistance?
A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twenty-three prisoners, turned them over to intelligence.

## Casualties?
Fourty-four, twenty one dead.

## Where are your men now?
Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.

## A private, sir?
He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.

## You writin' a book or somethin'?
As a matter of fact, I am.

## In West Fork?
In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer.

## What about the Captain? Where's he from?
Thirty-ought-six, Norton long-barrel with dual-groove, parallel rifling, elevated three-glass scope and a single-throw hammer.

## The Army gave you that?
Yep.

## You take account of the wind?
Did you see what he did, back there? He stepped right into the open, so I could get across.

## Jackson?
Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal, Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.

## You got somethin' against the Cap'n?
Hell, no. I think he's the best officer in the whole goddamned army, bar none.

## They got squirrels there, too, right?
Last I knew.

## Shut up, will you?
You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of. Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard.

## You know what the best possible thing that could happen is?
Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get lockjaw, never say another word as long as you live.

## Cap'n...?
Yes, sir.

## What do you think?
I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.

## I mean, Ryan, what do you think of him?
He ain't half-bad, I guess.

## What deal?
Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.

## Where?
In the shadow by those two trees.

## What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson?
Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.

## Who's Wade?
Sir, I understand what you're doin', but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner.

## Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n?
It's worth it.

## White-walls?
No white-walls, sir, there's a war on. NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER THERE! I can't help you, sir.

## How about that jeep?
A paratrooper named Ryan. He's going home, if he's alive.

## Senator's son?
Glad of it.

## Upham?
Pass.

## Sarge?
I wasn't made for this.

## You think the rest of us were?
It looks like a Renoir.

## Yes. Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?
I've been humming it.

## You know classical music?
Some.

## Where are you from, Captain?
Over three-hundred.

## Did he see any sign of them?
No, but he heard firing, just east, less that a kilometer.

## What is it?
A machine gun.

## What about our grenades?
Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.

## Sure, you got one?
The Germans do.

## What'd you say, Captain?
I teach English at Addley High School in Addley, Pennsylvania.

## Captain, what about our deal?
I changed my mind.

## You tryin' to get yourself killed?
Don't need to, the Krauts go that covered.

## Caen?
I wish. You and I are taking a squad up to Ramelle on a public relations mission.

## You? Leading a squad?
Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.

## What about the company?
Simpson.

## Okay, Wade. Translators?
Fresh out.

## What about Talbot?
Twenty minutes ago. Miller Damn, I'll go see if I can find another one. You get Reiben, Jackson and Wade, meet me at transport.

## You get a translator, Captain?
I've got a line on one.

## We in radio contact with anybody up there?
Hell of a mission.

## Got it, sir. We gonna go take care of those eighty-eights?
That's not what we're here for.

## You got me. Afraid of bad news?
Nope.

## You think they'll be alright?
They're fine. As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.

## And what about you?
They guys here aren't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up.

## Makes you feel small, doesn't it?
It doesn't take this.

## Is it getting worse?
No. It comes and goes. It stops when I look at it.

## Snatches the morphine from Sarge. Quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot. He's done this before.
Yeah? What rule of thumb is that?

## You alright?
Let's just find someplace.

## What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off?
Vecchio.

## You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother. Have I ever told you about her?
Bits and pieces.

## And what about your own hand?
It could be worse. You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.

## And how do you bluff yourself?
Except this time, the mission IS a man.

## You want me to take over?
No, but if I get any worse, you'll have to relieve me.

## What do you think?
Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.

## What are we going to do?
We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.

## Captain, can I put in for a transfer?
Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork.

## Sir, what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here?
Don't worry, we're the only Rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into Caen.

## Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
There's a war on, good chance they're not still making lingerie in Caen.

## No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest. Or what about Faulkner? Or that little guy with the glasses?
Trust me, you're the best.

## Captain, can I ask you a question?
Sure, Reiben.

## Where are you planning on putting Private Ryan, sir?
Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me.

## Yeah, how so?
Ours is not to reason why.

## Huh?
Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.

## I'm sorry, sir, I apologize. But if you weren't a captain, or if I were a major, what would you say?
Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.

## Any further thoughts on the subject?
I'll make a note of your suggestions but I'll leave that last one to you, especially if he's already dead.

## I thought you said we had an hour, sir?
Well now I'm saying we're moving out. Get off your ass.

## Why's that?
Except for the last part, that one's not bad.

## Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?
No, sir.

## What if our guys open up, sir?
You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules.

## This bridge cannot be held. The Germans have two companies less than three miles from here. They have tanks.
I wonder if his cabin is still available?

## The hell you aren't, you're comin' with me if I have to drag you every inch of the way. You hear me, Private?
I hear you sir, but I'm not leaving.

## Yeah, yeah. I want you right next to me, no matter where I go, you understand?
Yes, sir.

## Upham and Jackson, what were they like?
Upham? Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.

## And Sarge?
Sarge? He was the best friend I ever had. Lemme tell you about Sarge...

## Frogs?
Lingerie.

## Yeah? So?
I usually like surprises.

## What are we likely to run into?
Damn fool. Sir.

## So, where are you from?
Get lost.

## How do you do it?
It's easy, it runs in my family, take my grandfather, for example...

## You think he really believed it?
Who knows? It worked.

## How fast?
Twenty-four-five.

## Pardon me?
Look, why don't you check it out for yourself? See if your father fits the profile.

## What's the profile?
You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.

## How can you, how can you say that?
Because he's guilty.

## So you refuse to answer my questions?
Just come down to my place of business, for god's sake. I have people here.

## Why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise?
Taking care of people isn't a growth enterprise, Mr Sims. I hope you write that down in your report, I'd like your bosses to read it.

## Is it a gift for your wife? Are you getting a set together?
No, I'm not married. It's for my daughter.

## For going to school?
Yeah, she won a fellowship.

## Listen, I don't know your name, but what are you doing for lunch?
I'm sorry, but they turned down your card.

## You're sure?
Yeah, I don't want it. Um, thank you very much. You're very kind.

## Lloyd?
Hey, sis.

## Hey, bad throat, huh J-man?
Why do you eat that stuff? There's no food in your food. Not too loud, the red line's there for a reason.

## How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?
Gee, it's easy.

## I was hilarious once, wasn't I?
Yeah.

## I just washed this shirt, didn't I?
No, no, don't go in there.

## Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
I'll be home soon.

## The movies are a good second date, you know, as a date?
But you never had a first date.

## What's a scam?
Going out as friends.

## Then what's love?
I'm gonna call her.

## Please?
That's just so embarrassing.

## Did you sleep with her?
I admit nothing.

## So, what's your point?
You've got to do something special. You've got to make a statement.

## What does it say?
Read it.

## Meaning?
Meaning that she made the second date a family audition, which is the kiss of death for Lloyd.

## \"Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd.\" I've never gotten a letter like this, have you?
I dream about it.

## Why?
It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.

## What is wrong with this girl?
Hey, I know this is a strange thing to say, but maybe Diane Court really likes Lloyd.

## One hundred thousand dollar fine and three months?
One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.

## Look, why don't you just call Diane again?
Visit her at the home.

## Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
Cause I'm a guy, I have pride.

## What are you doing?
Well, since I'm not only your father, I'm also your friend; I had to get you two presents.

## No, wait a minute. Everybody thinks you're what?
Everybody thinks I'm a priss.

## What?
I just had a phone call.

## Tell me, is it bad news?
No, no, just listen. You won the Wreath fellowship.

## I won?
God, I'll have to go on a plane.

## Wait a minute. How was Lloyd?
Well, I don't think he's really been embarrassed by it.

## Now why can't I tell the story?
Well, let me start it. I'm flying down to Los Angeles on business, and I decide to take her on her first aeroplane.

## Lloyd?
Dad, yes. And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.

## Did he ever get rough with you?
Dad, no. But I didn't want any problems, so I decided not to sleep with him.

## Do you love him?
I like him a lot.

## Dad, are you okay in there?
Just finishing up in here.

## Dad, did you do it? Did you take that money?
Sweetheart, no. Don't be ridiculous.

## You think you know what this money is?
Yes, I...

## Why are you being so hateful to me? Is this because of Lloyd?
No. I told you everything, you lied to me. I would have done anything for you.

## Mom, please?
Diane, I do have a history with this man, and it's not the greatest. I see you so seldom, I'd really rather know about you.

## You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life?
I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.

## If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
Alright.

## You will?
Okay. Oh, here's Ray. Just talk to him because when you don't, your mouth turns down.

## Hi. You called me?
Yeah. I read about your fellowship in the paper, and I'm very glad you called me back.

## Yeah?
Thank you very much.

## Whoah, what a day, huh?
Yeah. What a day.

## Quick question - do you know who I am?
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.

## Yeah, yeah, yeah. You remember?
No, I read it on the message.

## Okay, um, so it's Lloyd and... uh... uh... let's go out. Do you wanna go out?
Oh, thanks, but I'm busy.

## Busy?
Yes. Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.

## Are you busy on Friday?
Yeah, I have to help my father.

## Are you busy on Saturday?
Saturday, I have some things to do around the house.

## So you're monumentally busy?
Well, not monumentally.

## What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?
Hmmm....

## Pardon me?
I'll go.

## You will? Excellent, alright, this is great. You will, really?
Eight. Eight O' clock.

## What are these?
They're Bavarian Death style pretzels.

## Oh. Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?
No.

## Keymaster?
Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I have to keep their keys.

## So it's an honor?
No.

## So we can finally talk?
Yeah.

## He does this every year?
It's the worst job since keymaster.

## It's just you and your dad, right?
Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.

## What?
You're a great date. I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.

## So what's your job this summer?
Job? Being a great date.

## Yeah?
I think you should wear that.

## You think so?
Mmmm.

## After work?
I usually have a break after the dinner service, if you want to stop by.

## I know you think my job is strange. You don't like old people, do you?
Me? Sure I do.

## Wait, wait. You told her about me?
Yes.

## What did you say?
Well... just meet her.

## Be friends?
Yeah. With potential.

## Yeah, just keep going first, keep going around. Get the feel of it, feel the clutch, when you put it in a little?
Yeah.

## Yeah?
If you'll just maybe ease it into second.

## Am I wrecking my car?
Yeah, a little bit. Listen, this is important. When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.

## Little more gas. Ease it up. Hold on- minor setback. Now you feel confident, right?
Yeah.

## Now, go into second. Little more gas... Yeah! You can get this whole problem. Now, maybe you downshift to first?
This is so noble.

## Let's get outta here. You want to?
Yeah.

## Yes. Are you shaking?
No.

## Then why are you shaking?
I don't know. I'm happy.

## It did?
Uh-huh. It was wonderful.

## Why didn't you tell me?
It was wonderful.

## How do you know what I'm going to say?
I don't know what you're going to say, but I think that...

## Say what?
I think that we should spend some time apart.

## What's wrong?
Well, I need to study, and...

## You need to study?
Yeah.

## Okay, what did we just decide?
We decided...

## Cause I'm worried, did you just break up with me?
No, no.

## Well, if we're friends, why can't we see each other?
I think that we should stop going out on dates.

## Is this because of your dad?
No.

## Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
She figured it out. I'm sorry if that upsets you.

## Did you tell anybody?
Just my dad.

## You told your dad?
You have Corey and DC. I have my dad.

## Lloyd, I love you, okay?
What is that? What are you doing with your hands? Talk to me, you're talking like that girl Sheila.

## What do you want?
I'm sorry.

## What do you want?
My father's guilty. He lied to me, he lied to everybody. I just left home... I need you.

## You do?
Everything else means nothing to me. If I hurt you again, I'll die.

## I love you. How many more times do I have to say it?
One more time would be nice.

## Alright, high level air safety tips. If anything happens, it'll usually be in the first five minutes of the flight, right?
Okay.

## Alright, personalised flight care from Corey. Books, cassettes, magazines, anything?
Not right now, thanks.

## Nobody thought we'd do this. Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
No my brother, you have to go buy your own.

## Hello. May I please speak with Diane please?
Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment.

## Is this the guy with the Mustang?
No.

## The guy with the Datsun?
No.

## The truck?
Uh, no, not really, no actually, basically, you don't know me. I'm a friend of your daughters; well I sat with her yesterday at the mall.

## She's really pretty great, isn't she?
Yeah, she is. Good luck.

## Yeah. Honey?
Thanks Lloyd.

## How do you pay for one of those?
Well, we pay for the . That guy didn't want to part with it, a little matter of nine thousand dollars.

## Yeah Lloyd. What are your plans for the future?
Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.

## Are you going to England with her Lloyd?
That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.

## Are you?
Well Lloyd, I admire you for not hitching a ride. You know, my daughter's a lot different to you.

## I'm the distraction that's going to England with her sir. Are you alright sir? Are you okay?
\"You can't know the horrible disappointment I feel...\"

## So what's up?
Dude, why do you think I keep her tapes? They're going to be valuable some day.

## Your car?
Diane Court.

## How ya doin' Miss Evans?
You missed every one of your career counselling sessions. Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now.

## What?
My dad's a lieutenant colonel in the army, he wants me to join, he wants to pull some strings. I mean, there's no possible way.

## Mike Cameron. This is one fresh jam, huh?
Yeah.

## Yeah, but how come it worked? I mean like, what are you?
I'm Lloyd Dobler.

## Alright. Key?
Ooop, excuse me.

## How you doin', brother?
I don't really know where we are.

## You know Diane Court?
Wow, man. Well. Listen man, I need you to be the keymaster.

## You know, every year I throw this party, every year nobody helps me clear up. Why am I yelling?
I don't know. Good on you man. Alright Lloyd.

## 2 Nothing's changed. Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?
Things worked out. I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good.

## What's your name?
Sir, the list is correct.

## A charade? How could it be a charade?
Luck.

## What?
I feel like an old-fashioned couple. It feels good.

## Should I stay?
It's a beautiful city.

## Should I stay?
It's up to you.

## Yeah, what's that?
That you know the meaning of the word gratitude. That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.

## What's going on?
I got a shipment of Hungarians coming in, I got to make room for them. It's always something.

## When?
I don't know. Soon.

## What are you, Moses? What is this? Where's the money in this? What's the scam?
It's good business.

## If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually. But how?
I just told you.

## Where are the guards?
The guards aren't allowed on the factory floor. They make my workers nervous.

## What's that?
You don't recognize it? Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.

## So I'm responsible for the weather?
I asked for metal, you gave me glass.

## Ghetto Police. I'm a policeman now, can you believe it?
Yeah, I can.

## What do I got for you?
Takes diamonds to stay on this list.

## Like this?
There's nothing in the stores.

## You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?
Nice things cost money.

## How many?
I don't know, ten or twelve. That's a good color. Dark blues, grays.

## How you feeling, all right?
Yeah.

## What's the matter, everything all right at home? Mila's okay?
She's good.

## What's wrong with it?
How should I know? It's broken. See what you can do.

## Good. How's it going?
Things are great, things are great.

## What are you doing?
I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.

## How do you do?
Thank you.

## Wine?
We're losing the war, aren't we.

## Pistols?
Pistols, rifles, carbines ... I'd be grateful.

## What others?
He doesn't deserve your loyalty. More important, he's not worth you making threats against us.

## Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. Don't you think?
I think most people right now have other priorities.

## What was that about the SS, the rate, the ... ?
The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.

## I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's till hot. We're doing well?
Yes.

## Better this month than last?
Yes.

## Any reason to think next month will be worse?
The war could end.

## What?
There's a machinist outside who'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job.

## You try to be fair to people, they walk out the door; I've never understood that. What's next?
Christmas presents.

## Are you losing money?
No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.

## I'll admit it's a weakness. I don't think he enjoys it. All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?
There's nothing you can do. I'm not asking you to do anything. You came into my office.

## They arrived, can you believe it?
They're withholding payment.

## No?
I know what you're saying, but I don't see the difference.

## No, no, what, what is it?
I could've got more ... if I'd just ... I don't know, if I'd just ... I could've got more...

## Would it do any good?
No.

## A one-armed machinist, Oskar?
He was a metal press operator, quite skilled.

## How's the name search going?
37 usages of Himbry located in the registar's office. 9 Tatum's, 47 Riley's. And that's just on campus. It's hopeless.

## What now?
That doesn't work, sir.

## You're sure about this two person thing?
Broad daylight, a crowded movie theatre. This is too much fun for one person.

## PHONE What is it?
I heard a noise.

## PHONE Where?
PHONE Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...

## Cici. Who's this?
Someone who wants to talk to you.

## Where is everybody?
We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.

## Why aren't you there?
I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.

## Why do you always answer a question with a question?
I'm inquisitive.

## Hello? Ted?
No, it's me.

## WHAAAATT?
Don't forget to set the alarm.

## Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?
I live here.

## I had to change. Did anyone call?
Just some asshole trying to scare me.

## Can we talk?
I don't think that's a good idea.

## What do you want from me, Cotton?
You could start with an apology.

## How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life--how do I apologize for that?
I just thought if I saw you face to face, maybe it would help.

## Did it?
It helped me realize one thing.

## What?
You're a self-obsessed little cunt like your mother.

## Now, Gale, you were so instrumental in my freedom. You're not having character doubts now, are you?
You have a right to be angry.

## Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer-- NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?
Fair enough.

## What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting?
Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter.

## Hi, Gale, any leads?
Tons and tons.

## Where is Sidney's father?
Home--where he lives.

## Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
No, I don't.

## Youre all in this together?
Jesus, youre just as whacked as your son.

## What are you going to do?
Finish what my son started.

## How do you put up with this Greek shit?
Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie...

## What's your subject?
I WAS A SORORITY SLUT.

## Should we be worried about this guy? Isn't it kinda weird he just showed up and now people are dying?
I think he's doing Dolly.

## Are they aware of your not so positive portrayal of Greek life?
Not one bit.

## Where's Sid?
She dumped me.

## You freakin?
How are you? You weren't in class. I called as soon as I heard...

## I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
Don't ask what you can do. No coddling. Life rolls on status quo.

## About what?
The forbidden subject.

## What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?
It's under control.

## I had the four o'clock shift. You weren't there. You had us worried. Is everything okay?
No, it's not.

## Why?
Good question. You took the bait.

## Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel?
Youre not going to get away with this.

## Where's Sid?
Damned if I know. She ditched me.

## What guy?
Randy somebody.

## Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless?
Need some help, honey.

## Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life?
Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS? Well, Derek and I have this whole Mickey/Mallory-Woody Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing going on.

## Of course not. Who wants to? Whats the point if we dont get caught? Wheres the glamour in that?
A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.

## Oh yeah. We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. Its been an ongoing discussion. Heads or tails?
Tails.

## So what made you change your mind about Sidney?
Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.

## Not good. How you doin?
Not good.

## He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek?
Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.

## Can we turn the light on?
That's not the way it's done.

## Ssshh! What was that?
Let's find out.

## Dewey?
There's nothing. I'm coming down.

## Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything?
They thought it was a publicity stunt.

## Oh my God. How could it happen?
They don't know. It was carefully planned. Earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie.

## Who is this?
I'll give you one guess.

## Who are you?
That's not the way we play the game.

## What do you want?
You're pretty when you're angry.

## Where are you?
I'm everywhere.

## What do you want from me?
It's what you want from me.

## What do you mean?
You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.

## Sidney. Hello. How are you?
I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that...

## It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?
It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.

## What?
Oh my God.

## Where is your attacker?
I dont know.

## Is Sid in therapy?
I got a surprise for you.

## What?
\"If I should stay. I would only be in your way. So I'll go. And yet, I know, I'll think of you each step of the way...

## Time to change numbers again?
Nah...I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes.

## Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?
Please, I have the perfect excuse.

## What about rehearsal?
Gotta.

## I'll cover you through rehearsal. Derek when do you get outta docu- drama?
That was good.

## Who is that guy?
It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.

## Can I come with her?
No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright.

## How many guys they have on you?
I counted four.

## Is that cool? Just to leave her like that?
Randy Meeks. He was with Sid that night in Woodsboro.

## Her old boyfriend?
No, she killed her boyfriend. Randy was a friend. MICKEY Watch out, Derek.

## I gotta hit the library. Anatomy. Some of us have real majors. You gonna be okay, Sid?
You're not allowed to ask that.

## Gale?
She's not here right now.

## What's your favorite scary movie?
Closer than you think.

## Do you want to die?
I hate scary movies.

## Now why does she have to be naked? How does that serve the plot?
Why doesn't she just hang up and call the police? Stupid..

## I'm gonna pee. You want anything?
You ass.

## Come on, baby. Lighten up a little, will ya?
I get scared really easy, okay.

## What are you talking about?
He's after me.

## What was that?
Don't panic.

## Do you work for her now?
Me, too. Randy. Me too.

## I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?
I have this button I press. See? It insulates me. She mimes an air lock valve.

## Melinda McGraw?
No, the other one. The one who played his wife.

## Jesus. Hello?
Hello.

## Well what number are you trying to reach?
I don't know.

## Do I?
Uh-huh. Look bro, my battery is running out. Really wish I could chat, but I can't so, later.

## Listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?
More of a game really.

## What kind of a game?
I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!

## No! You listen to me, if you're not where I want you in fifteen minutes I'll hollow her out. Do you understand?
Yeah.

## Where are you?
Closer than you think.

## Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want from me?
To see your reaction.

## Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
Nope.

## Well you'll find neither. Rina Reynolds, however, You will.
Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those files except studio execs. Can you please go away now?

## What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'?
Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday.

## So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?
I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note.

## A note?
That's Sidney Prescott's mother.

## Alright Kincaid, no where to?
I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.

## Shit. Sarah Darling. I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
Yes well we have a suspect, so don't get that worried.

## Who?
But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.

## Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?
Whoever it is, now is taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder.

## Are you sure?
Absolutely.

## You mean like, movie trilogies?
You seem to like movies, Detective.

## Did you request this case?
No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business. I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios.

## What do you mean?
Ghosts are tough, you can't shoot ghosts.

## What did you know about your mother?
Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. That's good news.

## How is that good news?
Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer. And I know how to handle guys like that.

## Oh yeah, how?
Catch him, or kill him.

## Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark Kincaid. I'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you aware of last night's Events?
Yeah. A real tragedy.

## Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he was married to Maureen.

## Is that a threat, Detective?
When it's a threat, you'll know it.

## What Rielly?
There's someone here who wants to help.

## He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
No.

## And what made you think it was Sidney?
Sid, get in my car. You're coming back to the station with me where it's safe.

## What?
Follow me.

## Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?
No I'll be ok. I've got my mace. My knife. These two lethal weapons.

## They found another note?
You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.

## You used to say that was our strength.
So it's off to London for a week? New York for a month? L.A Forever?

## Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.

## All of what Dewey? You do know something, don't you?
Off the record.

## And?
The boys said no. She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.

## Someone stole Sid's file?
I've got my suspicions but still, nothing you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.

## And who is that?
Jennifer needs me.

## Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
I'm on duty.

## Has anyone else every used your phone?
Just Jennifer. And you.

## Nevermind, what'd you two find?
Paternity test results. Christ Dewey, you're never going to believe who Milton's kid is.

## Who is it?
Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again. The whole relationship thing.

## What's your point?
No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.

## I remember her! She was a bit player in a couple of my movies. A nobody! So what does it matter?
But you know who she was.

## Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way. Honestly though, tell us, what's your favorite scary movie?
Honestly, my life.

## Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?
I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important is that we stick together. No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen.

## Geez.
Who's phone?

## I am Gale Weathers!
None.

## There a story in that building?
I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member.

## Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies. His two hands, dingus.

## Oh come on! Why the hostility?
They're the ones who approved it.

## Just because you knew her?
Yeah.

## I don't think so! Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?
Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking.

## Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me! What are you doing here?
Who's this.

## All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!
What are you talking about?

## Page 22, Candy's big moment.
Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English class?

## Page 22.. Ring ring. Hello?
Hello.

## Why don't we just read the scene? Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple?
Whatever. Come on, who is this? I think you have the wrong number.

## But you know my favorite name?
I'm hanging up right now.

## Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?
It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.

## What? What movie?
My movie.

## I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?
Roman and everybody else went home for the night. I'm here for a make-up test.

## Make-up. You need it. Hey, Roman isn't here?
No.

## W-what do you want?
I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.

## Who is this?
The question isn't who I am. The question is, who's with me.

## Don't do it! If you do one thing to attract attention, one thing, I'll kill them both. Now, do you have somewhere we can be alone?
She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.

## WHERE?
I'll call you, when you're on your way.

## Yeah?
You follow directions good. Now let's wrap this production. Go to the Sunrise Studios backlot. I'll call you when you get there.

## Alright, I'm here. Now what?
You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.

## I thought you wanted me here?
Alright I'm here, now show your face so we can finish this.

## Hello?
Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.

## I'm sorry, your voice.
Are you sure?

## Sorry.
Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney? Are you listening to me, huh?

## How'd you do?
Piece of cake. She'll be there.

## So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
Duh... that's quick.

## I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive.

## You ready to party hard tonight?
You know it.

## Dude. What are you doing here?
I was hoping Sid and I could talk.

## Ready?
Yeah...

## I can't... I'm bad off, Billy. You cut too deep.
Where the fuck did she go?

## Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were you doing out at Sidney's tonight?
I just wanted to see her, that's all.

## You rode your bike out there?
Yes, sir.

## Did you ride past Casey Becker's house?
No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff.

## You sleep in THAT?
My dad's in the other room.

## What are you doing here?
It just occurred to me that I've never snuck through your bedroom window.

## Oh it did?
So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.

## You know what my dad will do to you?
I'm going... I'm going.

## What's that?
Oh Billy... Please... God...

## See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
I'm so sorry... please understand.

## Then what is it? Is there somebody else?
No...

## Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.

## What?
You heard me.

## Are you serious?
Yeah... I think so.

## When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
I called my dad.

## You don't still think it was me?
I thought you were...

## Why did you kill my mother?
I don't understand...

## Not so fast. We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?
I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like your slut whore mother.

## What number are you trying to reach?
I don't know.

## Do I?
It happens. Take it easy.

## So why did you dial it again?
To apologize.

## What?
I want to talk to you for a second.

## Who is this?
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.

## What's that noise?
Popcorn.

## You're making popcorn?
Uh-huh.

## Really? What?
Just some scary movie.

## Do you like scary movies?
Uh-huh.

## What's your favorite scary movie?
I don't know.

## Uh... HALLOWEEN. You know, the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters. What's yours?
Guess.

## Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers?
Yeah... Freddy Krueger.

## Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
No.

## Why do you want to know my name?
Because I want to know who I'm looking at.

## What did you say?
I want to now who I'm talking to.

## What do you think I said?
I have to go now.

## Yes?
I told you not to hang up on me.

## What do you want?
To talk.

## You getting scared?
No-bored.

## Is this some kind of a joke?
More of a game, really.

## What do you want?
TO SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE.

## Or else what?
My boyfriend will be here any second and he'll be pissed when I tell him...

## How do you know his name?
Go to the back door and turn on the porch light -- again.

## Where are you?
Guess.

## Why are you doing this?
Turn off the light.

## What's his name?
I can't think.

## What?
There are two doors to your house. A front door and a back one. If you answer correctly -- you live.

## Productive. So they're closing down the school?
Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.

## And why is that? Has something happened?
You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.

## Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father?
No, not yet.

## He's not a suspect, is he?
We haven't ruled out that possibil...

## What brings you out to these parts?
You never know when or where a story will break.

## Then what are you doing here?
Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.

## Mind if I join you?
Sheriff just radioed me. I'm gonna check out a possible lead. Thought you might like to join me.

## What kind of lead?
A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.

## I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?
Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.

## Can I bring Kenny?
NO! I mean... I should probably take just you.

## So is Dewey your real name?
Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago.

## We gotta get back. Jesus. He's here. What the fuck is he doing here?
I'll call for backup.

## What are you doing here?
Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.

## Does mom know?
Yes, you doofus.

## Hey... Dewey. Can we go now?
Hold up a sec...

## What is she doing here?
She's with me. I just wanted to check on things.

## You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit?
...yeah...

## You're sure it was the Hilton?
At the airport.

## He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
I don't know. I guess.

## Any word on my Dad?
Not yet, but we're looking. If you need anything...

## And my Dad? Any word on him?
God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.

## Have they found my father?
Afraid not.

## Should I be worried?
Not yet.

## How is everything?
We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis.

## What were you doing out here?
Drive by patrol.

## How is she?
She's tough.

## They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it?
Twenty years ago I woulda said not a chance. But these kids today... damn if I know.

## She staying with you?
We haven't located her Dad yet.

## Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?
Keeping my eye on Sidney.

## Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?
There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man.

## She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.

## Where is she?
Call the police.

## Where is she?
I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her.

## Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death row. A killer still on the loose. Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.
What? What?

## You want to go live?
No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete.

## What's the plan?
Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight's festivities.

## What's the delay?
About thirty seconds.

## It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right, GALE?
Yes, that's right.

## How's the book?
It'll be out later this year.

## Do you still think he's innocent?
He was convicted in a court of law. Your testimony put him away. It doesn't matter what I think.

## Have you talked to Cotton?
Many times.

## Has his story changed?
Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.

## Why would she lie about it?
For attention. The girl has some serious issues.

## And why would she do that?
Maybe she was hot for Steve and killed them both in a jealous rage.

## Where do you get this shit?
Ricki Lake.

## Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.

## What's your favorite scary movie?
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.

## Are you alone in the house?
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.

## So where are you?
Your front porch.

## Why would you call me from my front porch?
That's the original part.

## So where are you?
Right here.

## Can you see me right now?
Uh-huh.

## What am I doing?
Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now.

## Hello?
Hello Sidney.

## Can you knock?
I heard screaming.

## Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
Working, thank you.

## THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT -- How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies?
She's the Scream Queen.

## What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
It would certainly improve your high school Q.

## You coming tonight?
Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know. Now that's poor taste.

## If you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath would you be standing in the horror section?
It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything.

## The why'd the police let him go?
Because, obviously they don't watch enough movies. This is standard horror movie stuff. PROM NIGHT revisited.

## So what's his reason?
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.

## I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass?
Which is you...

## And what would be your motive?
It's 1995 -- motives are incidental.

## What's Leatherface doing here?
He came to make up.

## I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts. When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
Yeah.

## Why are they doing this?
Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.

## Are you serious?
My parents are out of town. It'll be like my hurricane bash last year. Nothing extreme. Just a few of us, hangin'.

## Why are you doing this?
It's all part of the game.

## So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them?
Peer pressure... I'm way to sensitive.

## What happened?
Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker and Steve Forrest were killed last night.

## Do they know who did it?
Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...

## They think it's school-related?
Or a man's mentality.

## How do you gut someone?
You sure I can stay over? My dad won't be back til Sunday.

## Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.

## Just like old times, ain't it?
No, nothing's like it used to be.

## Do you really think Billy did it?
He was there, Tatum.

## Shit, what is he doing here?
I bet he's pissed.

## This could be good. What do you think, Sid?
I don't know...

## If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.

## And you believe it?
Well... you can only hear that Richard Gere-gerbil story so many times before you have to start believing it.

## Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you?
Oh, god...

## Is Billy going to be there tonight?
He better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut. I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night.

## What do you think about when you're having sex?
With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, I think about Grant Goodeve.

## How does that get you in the mood with Stu?
Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.

## Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?
I don't know, they just did.

## Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid, what happened?
For once, Stu, drop it.

## Hey, guess who's here? It's that chick from INSIDE STORY?
I don't have anyone else to give this to, Somerset, you know that. And nobody's going to swap with you.

## How's that?
There's nothing that says I have to work with him. If Somerset wants out, \"goodbye.\" Give it to me.

## How is it working for a scumbag like this? You proud of yourself?
Ease back, Mills.

## What do you think?
I'm in.

## Announcing what?
There are seven deadly sins. Gluttony, wrath, greed...

## Have you heard?
No, I haven't heard.

## Come on. What are you going to do with yourself out there?
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm. I'll work on the house.

## What are you talking about?
You know.

## Really?
Well, there he sits. It's not supposed to make sense.

## How you feeling?
I can breathe withour pain now, so I guess I feel great.

## Where was the prostitute? Where was she?
She was... she was on the bed. She was just sitting on the bed.

## Who tied her down? You or him?
I'm... I'm just delivering a package.

## I mean, at this point, what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself?
It doesn't matter who I am. Who I am means absolutely nothing. You need to turn left here... at the traffic light.

## What's so exciting?
It's not too far away now.

## Why?
You'll see.

## What makes you so special that people should pay attention?
Not me. I'm not special. I'm not exceptional. This is, though. What I'm doing.

## Murderers?
A woman...

## Murderers like you?
Delusions of grandeur.

## And, why is that?
You're going to be remembered, and it's all because of me. And, the only reason I'm here right now is because I wanted to be.

## What the fuck is going on?
I want you to know, I wish I could have lived like you do.

## I meant to ask you something, Mills, when we spoke on the phone. I can't help wondering... why here?
I... I don't follow.

## I wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into?
Drop it.

## Who said this was murder?
No one yet.

## Please be quiet for a while, would you?
There's a bucket here.

## What?
There's a bucket. Under the table.

## You think it was poison?
Guessing at this point is useless.

## You've seen my files, right? Seen the things I've done?
No.

## Is that clear?
Okay... sure... It's just that, with my old partner, you know...

## Have you found any plastic scrapings near the stove or sink? Near the food?
This doesn't make any sense.

## Can we talk about this in private?
It's a package deal. You get the phone with the office.

## Detective Mills here. Honey... I asked you not to call me here. I'll call you back... What? Why?
It's my wife.

## Well?
I'm invited to have a late supper at your house. And, I accept.

## How's that?
Tonight.

## The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.
What about sports?

## Did you read them?
Seven Terraces of Purgation.

## Forced what?
Attrition. When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.

## No fingerprints?
Nothing.

## No witnesses of any kind?
None. Which I don't understand. He had to get back out.

## You're sure your men didn't move this?
Even if they did, those photos were taken before forensics.

## What the fuck is that?
A switchblade.

## What?
No.

## And you don't?
I wish I still thought like you.

## Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
You tell me. I'm new in town.

## Satisfy our curiosity?
Never took a bullet. I pulled my gun once. fired it once.

## And?
It was my first one of these. We were a secondary unit, and I was pretty shaky going in. I was still considered a rookie.

## How was it?
I expected it to be bad, you know. I took a human life... but I slept like a baby that night. I never gave it a second thought.

## How do those cockroaches get here so quick?
Just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him Einstein.

## How much money do you have?
I don't know... like fifty.

## Him?
For a long time, the F.B.I.'s been hooked into the library system, keeping accurate records.

## What? Assessing fines?
You got to be kidding.

## How is this legal?
Legal... illegal. These terms don't apply. I don't applaud it.

## How do you know all about this?
I don't. Neither do you.

## Modern Homicide Investigation. In Cold Blood. Of Human Bondage. Human Bondage?
It's not what you think it is.

## You're sure you're reading that right? John Doe?
That's what it says. Jonathan Doe.

## What are you going to say?
You do the talking. Put that old silver tongue of yours to work.

## Are you alright?
I'm fine.

## What happened?
Wait... just wait.

## No point in arguing anymore...
What the fuck is wrong with you?

## What are you talking about?
We had him.

## How can you say that? Especially after today?
Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind. There's no winning and losing here.

## Where's the victory?
You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.

## What the fuck is wrong with you? What burnt you out?
Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right? No one's worthy of you.

## Oh, you want to stay now?
One of two things will happen. We're either going to get John Doe, or he'll finish his series of seven, and this case will go on for years.

## You think you're doing me a big favor by staying?
I'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days. You'd be doing me the favor.

## When do we get to question him?
You know he's fucking us.

## Well... what the fuck, man?
No.

## What is it?
Tell me it's not true.

## I don't know why... why now?
Please, I need you to help me if we're going to get who did this.

## Are you absolutely certain?
I can't do this now... please.

## Why is this painting hanging upside-down?
It's nice to meet you. My husband has told me a lot about you... except your first name.

## Really?
Don't worry. I don't wear it at the dinner table.

## Too long. What do you think so far?
I don't know, with this case.

## Did the wife confess?
When the patrolman came she was trying put his head back together. She was crying too hard to say anything.

## Did their son see it happen?
I don't know.

## How should I know?
But Mose Harper said...

## That old goat still creakin' around?...Whyn't someone bury him?
It was Ethan found you squallin' in a sage clump after your folks was massacred...

## Passed the Todd place comin' in... What happened to 'em?
They gave up...went back to the cotton rows...So'd the Jamisons... Without Martha, I don't know...She wouldn't let a man quit.

## You're my brother...You're welcome to stay as long as you got a mind to...Ain't that so, Martha?
Now, Ethan, I ain't sure...

## It's not a sword, ma...It's a sabre! Did you kill many damYankees with this sabre, Uncle Ethan?
It's all right, ma...I been watchin'... Only I wish...

## Killed every one -- an' not for food either...Why'd they do a thing like that?
Stealing the cattle was just to pull us out...This here's a murder raid... It shapes up to scald out either your place...or my brother's.

## That'll be the day!...Let's ride.
Why don't you finish the job?

## Why'd they break off? Was there water in that canyon?
Huh...? No...no water.

## I ain't wearing no gun.
Charlie!...You weren't fixin' to marry HIM?

## Another one, eh?
This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.

## Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?
No sir...pleasure.

## You all right, sergeant?
Dunno...Seems so.

## You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam?
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.

## Got a warrant?
You fit a lot of descriptions.

## You got any more orders, Captain?
Just keep goin'...

## Evenin'...evenin' Reverend...or do I call you 'Captain'...?
Came here for a wedding, Ethan... Until that's over, I reckon 'reverend' will do...

## This an invite to a necktie party, Reverend?
We can get within 500 yards...there's a hogback to the south.

## Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...
How many, would you say?

## Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?
Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...

## But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir?
Yes, sir...

## Is Captain Clayton here, Reverend?
I'm Clayton.

## Hold on, son...Who's this Colonel Greenhill you're talking about?
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.

## JOINT action?
Yes sir...We've received information about a band of Comanches under a chief named Scar...

## And what makes you think he's in this territory?
But...but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow...for your own protection...

## Debbie, think back! I'm Martin... remember? Remember how I used to let you ride my horse? Tell you stories? Don't you remember me, Debbie?
I remember...from always...At first I prayed to you...come and get me... Take me home...You didn't come...

## Ay-eh...That's jest what I tole Joe Powers...That un's gettin' kinda sassy, ain't he, Ethan?
Leggo my arm...You look mangier 'n ever.

## Come f'r my rockin' chai'...ole Mose.
Swear it, Ethan?...Given word?

## Where's Scar, Mose...SCAR?
Mose...try to remember!...You were in Scar's camp...

## Scar! Where's he holed in?
Seven Fingers...ay-eh...Seven...

## How'd you come by this?
You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.

## Ain't yours yet.
You got it with you?

## I beg your pardon?
That camp you hit was Nawyecka Comanche...Chief Scar's bunch...

## Don't have to call me 'sir' neither... Nor grampaw neither...Nor Methuselah neither...I can whup you to a frazzle.
Keefer!..Put this man under arrest!

## Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
Well, fust off...

## You all right, Ethan?
Huh...? Sure I'm all right...

## Say!...What happened to your blanket? Lose it?
Must've...Anyway, I ain't goin' back to look for it...

## What you goin' to do?
Get some sleep...Tomorrow's another day...

## And you think we got a chance to find her?
Good night...Laurie...

## Why?
Because she's my...my...

## Hey! What's the idea...?
Maybe I'm gettin' like Mose Harper -- my bones is cold tonight...

## What's that?
Sorta like 'roundabout' -- like a man says he's goin' one place when he means to go just the reverse...

## Futterman?
He just couldn't wait...

## Scar?
When are you goin' to learn to keep your mouth shut! Come on. Let's get out of here.

## Says her name's Wild Goose Flying in the Night Sky...but she'll answer to Look since it pleases ya...
Think it might be...?

## She ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain...not if she took off where the arrow points.
Look?

## No...She's not...
Think she means for us to follow?

## I ain't sure...Where's that doll?
Lemme alone...

## You figger Scar means to kill us?
He's got to...All these years, run- nin', dodgin', knowin' we were after him...Now we caught up...It's him or us.

## Why didn't he make his move back there?
Go on! Get out of here while you can...

## What's goin' on?
Not far from it...

## Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
No...not yet...

## You've seen her!...She's alive?
I've seen her...and she's alive.

## The late Mister Futterman?
That means Mister Futterman is dead, by golly.

## Martie...don't go! Not this time.
What you gettin' red-in-the-face for?...I have brothers, haven't I?

## You crazy?
It's too late...She's a woman grown now...

## Where?
You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...

## Why else?
Come on, say it. You know...

## Me and the muse, of course. How is your book coming along?
Oh, the muse... we're still having our differences. You know how it is with women.

## What kind of a horrible thing is that?
I'll do it myself.

## My father was a pilot. And do I know how to fly?
Hey, flower child, the sixties are over. And this stuff is hazardous to your health.

## Where are you going?
Well, if you won't let me smoke grass, then at least I'll go get myself some cigarettes.

## What are you doing?
Making our very own solstice fire.

## Is everything alright? Aren't you feeling well?
I just had a really strange experience.

## I have a funny feeling. Do you think we'll get over all that's happened?
We just have to make a new beginning.

## What?
Cherry-red Tears, your first book. I read it at least nine times. And then I found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.

## Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
Maybe different. I don't know, Ellen.

## Who was that?
Someone from the village.

## Now, what did I do to deserve this?
Come on, at least try one. It took me two hours to make these.

## So, did you sleep good?
Yeah... I have to go to town.

## Don't tell me you've made friends with that wandering flea circus?
Why not? She can guard the house. By the way, I gave her a name, Clara.

## Where have you been?
The house - Tommi - something just doesn't jive here...

## Who's that?
I haven't the slightest idea.

## Maybe an animal.
What?

## Let me guess, Another short circuit?
Hi, darling.

## During the Middle Ages people were executed at every corner. What's your point?
Damn it, look at you! Don't you see what's happening with you? We need to get out of here, don't you understand? Out of this house!

## We loved each other once. Have you forgotten that?
I told you, there is no way out. He won't let you go.

## How did you get me out of there?
I wouldn't have made it by myself.

## You don't remember?
Ellen.

## But what is the truth?
I don't know all about what happened back then. But it always stood between me and my husband.

## Does this dog here belong to you?
No, I've never seen him before.

## Do I look like it that much?
Village gossip. You're a real attraction here.

## 1976. What happened back then?
Do yourself a favor, Don't ask.

## And that is?
I think I've killed him. Martin, my husband, I've killed him! That is, I'm not sure, but...

## Oh, Mrs. Straub. May I introduce you to my wife?
Just call me Elisabeth.

## Peculiar? You mean, like back then?
Yes, something was...

## Hammer?
How could I fail to notice that! - I have to go...

## Damn, this thing is heavy. Where do you want to have it?
Tenth floor.

## I guess someone lost their key. You did get your tetanus shots, I hope?
Twenty-three, to be exact.

## Hey, my man! How's the masterpiece coming along?
Locked safe in here. I leave the scene in your safe keeping, Ned, I have a sonnet to write.

## You did not like the speech?
NedI knowI know

## Ohwhat have I done?
Yes.

## Really?
I had the Christopher Marlowe in my boat once.

## Do you know that house?
Sir Robert De Lesseps.

## Lady?
Viola De Lesseps. Known her since she was this high. Wouldn't deceive a child.

## What do you want, Kit?
My Massacre at Paris is complete.

## You have the money?
Tomorrow.

## And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?
Ask him.

## There is no dog in the first scene, Will Kempe, thank you. How goes it Will?
I am still owed money for this play, Burbage.

## Not from me. I only stole it. When are you coming over to the Chamberlain's Men?
When I have fifty pounds.

## Are you writing?
A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.

## What is the chief part?
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.

## It's for Henslowe. He paid me.
The title?

## How much?
Ten pounds.

## yet cannot love nor write it.
Tell me, are you lately humbled in the act of love?

## Will it restore my gift?
The woman who wears the snake will dream of you, and your gift will return. Words will flow like a river. I will see you in a week.

## Who is that?
I saw his Tamburlaine, you know. Wonderful.

## When?
Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity's sake.

## What's the title?
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.

## Romeo and Ethel The Pirate's DaughterAlmost finished?
Without doubt he is completing it at this very moment.

## So what do we do?
Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns out well.

## How?
I don't know. It's a mystery.

## Where is the play?
Oh, it's coming, it's coming.

## Is it going well?
Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles.

## Do you know it?
Every word.

## She is always Aphrodite.
Will! Where is my play? Tell me you have it nearly done! Tell me you have it started. You have begun?

## Who wrote that?
Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.

## Fifty pounds? What for?
Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.

## Where are you going?
To my weekly confession.

## Now where? Will?
To the Palace at Whitehall.

## Rosaline? You mean Ethel.
Is it about a pirate's daughter?

## Will! Have you finished?
Yes. Nearly. It's all locked safe in here. We need Ralph for the Pirate King. Good morning, Master Nol. You will have a nice little part.

## My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I have a few debts here and there. Well, that seems to be everybody. Did you see a Romeo?
I did not.

## Cut round him for now.
Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages?

## What? Who?
Romeo.

## What?
Juliet? You mean Ethel.

## God's teeth, am I to suffer this constant stream of interruption?! What will you do in Act Two when he meets the love of his life?
By God, I wish I knew.

## How will it?
I don't know, it's a mystery.

## Juliet does not come on for twenty pages. It will be all right.
What do we do now?

## How will it?
Wonderful, wonderful.

## And yours?
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter. Yes, I know.

## What is the story?
Well, there's a pirate In truth, I have not written a word.

## Do you think?
The daughter of his enemy.

## It would be better that you tell her to get off her knees and show some civility to her six-day lord and master.
A different one you haven't written?

## Not ready? Where is she?
Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.

## But at the playhouse. Nurse?
Be still.

## Like Valentine and Silvia?
He looks well enough for a mountebank.

## They are not acted for you, they are acted for me.
What do you love so much?

## And--?
And I love poetry above all.

## Above Lord Wessex?
As stories must when love's denied--with tears and a journey. Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put asunder.

## Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?
Burbage has my keeping but you have my heart.

## Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome, George Bryan! James Armitage! Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to fall in love again?
I am, Master Shakespeare.

## But your voice Have they dropped?
It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.

## Is she obedient?
As any mule in Christendom. But if you are the man to rider her, their are rubies in the saddlebag.

## You have opened the playhouses?
I have, Master Shakespeare.

## Who are you, master?
I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's daughter.

## You admire it?
I like it when they cut heads off. And the daughter mutilated with knives.

## Oh. What is your name?
Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.

## Answer me only this, are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
I am.

## You would not leave me?
I must. Look-- how pale the window.

## I found something in my sleep. The Friar who married them will take up their destinies.
Mr. Henslowe?

## Oh, but it will end well for love?
You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.

## Will! What--?
A literary feud. Quite normal.

## The Queen commands a comedy, Will for Twelfth Night.
Will you read it for me?

## An excellent beginning Let him bea duke. And your heroine?
Sold in marriage and half way to America.

## No. I have spoken to the Queen. Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
How does it?

## Do you intend to marry, my lord?
I do not love you, my lord.

## But why me?
It was your eyes. No, your lips.

## The Queen has consented?
She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.

## Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
Oh!--dear God, I did not think it would be me to tell you. A great loss to playwriting, and to dancing.

## Your name?
THOMAS Thomas Kent. I would like to do a speech by a writer who commands the heart of every player.

## Where did you learn how to do that?
THOMAS I ...

## THOMAS Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
Let me see you. Take off your hat.

## Do you understand me?
THOMAS No, sir.

## He is speaking about a baggage we never even meet! What will be left in your purse when he meets his Juliet?
THOMAS If you love her, you must do what she asks.

## And break her heart and mine?
THOMAS I  Her letter came to me by the nurse.

## Your aunt?
THOMAS Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a little. Tell me how you love her, Will.

## THOMAS And her voice? Like lark song?
Deeper. Softer. None of your twittering larks! I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song.

## I was a poet till now, but I have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the Tower.
THOMAS She sings too?

## By coveting my property. I cannot shed blood in her house but I will cut your throat anon. You have a name?
All right, just a few questions.

## With which of the following figures do you most closely identify, Joan of Arc, Eva Braun or Marilyn Monroe?
Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination.

## What?
Chess. Chess is often used as well.

## You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
Discussion group, Alex, discussion.

## About what?
About this guy, this Hugo person.

## I saw my grandmother, of course, but I don't suppose that counts. I mean, she was alive at the time.
Have you seen him?

## Can I show you something?
No.

## Juliet?
You mean immoral.

## You think so?
He's still here.

## When are you going to let the police know?
You call them if you want.

## And what about you?
Now what else? DAVID I don't know.

## So who's going to do it?
Dig the pit, I don't know.

## Then what? Who's going to do what?
You know what I'm talking about.

## Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
You know what. Who's going to do it.

## We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
I can't do it.

## Is that going to be deep enough?
Don't you worry about that.

## Is this necessary?
Yes. Now come on, all or nothing.

## Can we talk about something?
Not now. I have an idea.

## What's the problem?
I want to talk now.

## Yeah, but you were good, you were really good. Fucking bin-bag', I liked that. You were good. You explored your maleness to the full there.
Good luck. I love that guy, but why does he have to follow us around?

## How much did you pay?
I don't know.

## How much did you pay?
I don't know.

## How much?
I don't know.

## What is this?
Security.

## From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
There was a break-in.

## What's all this for, more security?
I fitted a lock up there. On the inside.

## What's wrong?
Nothing.

## Not eating what?
Not eating like you used to, that's what.

## You looking for me?
Looking for you? Yes.

## What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
We just wanted to speak to you.

## Who?
Your friends.

## I beg your pardon?
But they know.

## Yeah?
I bought the tickets. One for her and one for me. It was my idea.

## I don't know.
Cover it?

## Is this being recorded?
This is just an informal discussion.

## What does it look like?
It looks like he's writing everything down.

## Well, then?
I've never seen any of these men before.

## And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you?
Yes, I suppose so.

## Parked outside?
No, not any more. I just wondered if it would surprise you.

## That's all?
Sorry to waste your time.

## Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?
Yes, thanks.

## Good. Well, you've seen the flat?
Yes.

## And you like it?
Oh, yes, it's great.

## Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?
Yes.

## What?
Nothing. We thought you were someone else.

## Cameron?
Yes.

## And when did anyone last say to you these exact words, You are the sunshine of my life'?
Did you know --

## -- I'd be the first topoint that out. In all kindness I would. But, like they say, you know, she's got to want to change, hasn't she?
Has he tried down the back of the fridge? I mean, that's where I normally find things.

## Who was it?
I don't know. He sounded Swedish. Do you know any Swedish men? Maybe it was just the emotion.

## A miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet.
So we'll meet him, then?

## Know and love?
Yeah.

## No. Any idea which channel he's on?
David hasn't seen him either.

## David?
Hugo.

## What sort of car?
Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.

## So?
Open it.

## You want me to kick it open?
Yes.

## Now?
Yes.

## I wonder how he killed himself. I presume that that's what happened. What do you think?
Alex.

## What are you doing?
I'm just looking.

## Don't look?
No.

## No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
Unfeasible.

## Who's going to do it?
I thought we all were.

## David?
Be careful.

## Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?
Stop nagging.

## Who?
Cameron. You remember Cameron.

## What's he doing here?
That's not him.

## Who was it?
Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing.

## Are you all right?
No.

## Is this the same stuff you made last week?
No, no, it's different.

## Don't you?
I don't see the point in that.

## No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.

## What are you doing here?
We have to talk.

## Your painful groin?
Later. But first -- him.

## He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.
David?

## And the money?
We could put it somewhere.

## Where he can't get it?
Now you thought of that, not me.

## Expecting anyone?
No.

## Aren't you going to answer it?
Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.

## You'll wait in the hall?
I'll wait there.

## And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?
Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.

## What?
As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.

## Don't worry about it. I'd do exactly the same, but I don't think I'm his type.
Are you all right?

## Don't you ever stop?
No.

## What?
You were going to say something.

## What was I trying to say? Oh, yes, I think, we think, or at least I suppose we think -- am I right?
It's OK. There's no problem.

## Can you afford this place?
Yeah.

## What about?
It's about the burglary.

## Burglary?
Downstairs.

## did you hear anything before he cries?
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.

## Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
No, nothing, sorry.

## Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
Of course.

## And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
There are only two other people in the flat.

## Who said there were four?
We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.

## How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure?
Yes, absolutely.

## I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.

## Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
I don't know. Maybe I'm a light sleeper.

## Is this where no one stays?
Yeah, that's right, that's it.

## Do you smoke?
Look, it's a fairly straightforward question. You're either divorced or you're not.

## Did you ever kill a man?
Just get on with it, Alex.

## Is this what they always look like?
Yes.

## Are you all right?
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.

## Would you like to talk about it?
No.

## Do you know many of these people?
Yes. They're my friends.

## Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time?
I'm sorry.

## Two hundred pounds?
Two hundred pounds.

## You paid two hundred pounds for this?
That's what it cost, David.

## Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
No.

## Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
No one. I promise.

## Who have you talked to?
No one.

## With a face like this?
I'm sorry.

## You and me?
Yes.

## What?
That's right. You're going to Rio. Rio de Janeiro. On your own. Come on, you should know. You bought the fucking ticket.

## Sorry?
Here.

## Right here?
Not any real sneering as such, no.

## And that's why I think you fit in here.
There's a whole wide world out there, and it all needs to be accounted for, doesn't it?

## I'm boring?
You get the job done.

## What guy?
That guy, the one that died.

## What guy that died?
That one, last week.

## Yeah, here, I mean, where else?
Oh, him. Well, he died.

## Would you like to come in?
I'd be delighted.

## What do you do?
Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.

## What's it about?
A priest who dies.

## Do you think you could answer that?
The telephone? It continues to ring.

## A little bit. Is that good or bad?
It's an improvement.

## Shall I answer it?
No, just leave it. He knows I must be at home. I'm working nights this week.

## Working nights?
I'm a doctor.

## And he's a patient of yours?
No. But he needs treatment.

## For what?
A certain weakness.

## And that's not the same thing?
No, but like all novelists, I'm in search of the self.

## What?
Yes, the first one's fine. Heathrow direct.

## Well, it's up to you. Seven six five. How will you be paying?
Take all the time you like, doctor.

## Do you think you have a good memory for faces?
Same as everyone else.

## But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. No?
Yes.

## And what do you recognize, names or faces?
Diseases.

## Sorry?
And you said you supposed so, but I wasn't offering it for debate.

## One other thing. Do you have any tattoos?
Your watch.

## Or a fake?
You're in a good mood today, George.

## Yeah, baby. Things are great. Listen, there's Devra, whatta you want?
It's great. You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...

## Look, would you argue with your doctor?
No.

## Don't you like her?
No, it's a very groovy girl.

## Then what's the problem?
She's a very groovy girl. That's the problem.

## Who?
That kid... the hairdresser.

## Maybe... why do you ask?
I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.

## Why?
Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy.

## You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?
Yes, but... I thought...

## What?
That you were just indulging me.

## That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
It's just -- fabulous. Think you could do anything for me?

## -- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
What do you expect me to do about it?

## Can't we go into this later, sweetheart?
We cannot go into this later.

## -- is that right?
-- yes, we're all trying to do something to make this a better country to live in, believe it or not.

## -- is that what this is all about?
-- is that what this is all about?

## What are you talking about?
-- think what you have time to think, Lester.

## Whoever she is, she doesn't give up, does she?
No.

## What're you looking for?
My keys.

## You mean that girl, don't you?
Thanks a lot.

## Why not?
I'll be right back, it's just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks.

## What?
These attacks... it's got something to do with her... uh... pancreas.

## Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
Yeah, I think so.

## That's very serious. Who's her doctor?
I don't know.

## She did?
It turned out to be cancer.

## -- What?
Nummers.

## What?
I'm not used to that kind of treatment.

## What kind of treatment?
I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now.

## What're you doing later?
Whatever you say.

## We have this political thing tonight. Could you comb me out at the house?
I don't know. I'm beginning to feel guilty.

## What about?
All I ever do is play. I should be doing something to get my own shop open.

## Your husband?
Yes.

## What about?
The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him.

## Is she all right?
I don't know. Just a minute...

## She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.

## Why didn't you come alone? Lester invited you. Did you have to bring her?
Well she...

## She what?
She's a friend of Jill's.

## And who's Jill?
Sweetheart, it's a bore out there... let's lock the door.

## Don't be silly. I'll just tell Lester we were smoking a couple of joints. See?
Oh, no.

## You going to answer it?
Uh-uh.

## Want me to?
Let it ring.

## Like what?
I don't know, kill herself. She's O.D.'d four times.

## Well, is she your girlfriend?
No.

## Are you?
No.

## It isn't?
No. You know too many sick ladies.

## You here to see my mother?
Yeah.

## Hungry?
A little.

## This is the one thing I like about this house... want some lox?
No thanks.

## You're my mother's hairdresser?
I do her hair, yeah.

## Chopped liver?
No thanks.

## Did you hear me?
Yeah.

## Well, are you? Are you queer?
... yeah.

## C'mon, are you or aren't you?
Gee, this is great.

## Why do you wanna know so bad?
See if you've been making it with my mother.

## Have you ever made it with a girl?
I asked you first.

## Making it with my mother?
I'd like to do your hair sometime.

## Why?
... just, you could look very heavy...

## You don't have to make conversation with me, I'm not my mother... do you have a thing about older women... that's sort of faggoty isn't it?
Yeah, it is.

## You think that's funny, don't you?
Yeah.

## Beverly Hills hairdresser... what kind of a thing is that to do... you might as well be a faggot... think that's funny too?
No.

## Then what do you think?
Yeah.

## Right now?
Yeah.

## How is she?
Great.

## So you want to go in business for yourself?
Right.

## And you need money?
Right, that's right.

## They are?
After all, Mr. Roundy, we're paying six percent. Six percent. FHA's at eight and a half -- no, we won't be going back to the old days.

## What sort of references do you have?
Well, I do Barbara Rush.

## Pardon me?
Her hair, I do Barbara Rush.

## You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
George!

## Buffums?
Yes, Buffums.

## Great. Who's been doing your hair?
Jesus...

## -- Yeah... your car down here?
-- Listen, I'm supposed to take Jill to El Cholo tonight. She's really going to be pissed if I don't.

## -- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?
I don't know. Probably not.

## How long you had this?
Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.

## Yeah -- he doesn't happen to know that we went together, does he?
-- Well no. It never came up.

## You going to tell him?
-- What for? Honey, I'll see you later.

## Shut up, it's all right. Do you want a drink?
No, thanks.

## Where do you want to do this?
Probably the bathroom.

## Well, what do you think?
I'd cut it...

## You would?
Yeah, I think so...

## Okay... but I want you to know one thing. I've got to look great tonight, I mean I have to look great, okay?
Okay.

## What's wrong?
It's hot in here.

## Do you? You still see him?
No.

## Why not?
... he tried to... uh... make it with me.

## Did you?
It was after you, baby. After you.

## Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
No... Lester likes it on all the time in case he wants to use it.

## Did Lester know about him?
There was nothing to know. Anyway... if I can't have love I have to at least have money. I have to have some pride I can do something.

## Did I what?
You know what I'm talking about.

## You did, didn't you?
Baby...

## You just can't stand to miss one of them, can you?
George...

## Shut the door, Lester. What do you think this is, a picnic?
-- you'll be the prettiest thing in the room -- light's green...

## -- what guy?
-- this guy with Jill.

## We're upstairs, George. Now come on. Behave yourself, and for Christ's sake, do me a favor. Don't let me drink too much.
What about it?

## You don't do that anymore, do you?
Don't do it.

## -- what?
I don't know what gets into me.

## You always say that... I really care for Lester, don't I?
That sounds like me.

## He still having parties?
He never stopped.

## The lawn -- it looks like it goes on forever, doesn't it?
-- yeah.

## Am I entertaining you?
We're friends.

## -- what?
Nothing.

## Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?
Not me, pal.

## -- do you want ice?
-- we're kidding ourselves.

## -- we are?
-- last night I dreamt I was fifty years old and Mary told me I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. It seared me shitless.

## Why?
I can't imagine being with Jill when she's fifty years old. I can't imagine not being with you.

## I've got to leave?
-- yes, honey, you've got to get out of here.

## Why?
Lester's on his way.

## So what? You don't love him, do you? Answer me.
Where are you going?

## What?
God, there's Lester...

## What for?
I don't know -- I've got to.

## Do you know what that Lillian Bercovici just did?
No, man.
