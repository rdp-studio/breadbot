well, whatever it was, it's gone now.

## how much time do we have?
packard!

## where to, mr. thatch?
we're looking for a big crevice of some kind.

## are you sure you're checked out on this class of vehicle?
uhh...

## ahh.
can you drive a truck?

## you didn't just drink that, did you?
mm hmm.

## it only took me, like, what?
1 0 seconds, 1 1, tops.

## vinny, what do you think?
i could unroadblock that if i had about 200 of these.

## hey, too bad we don't have some nitroglycerin, eh, milo?
well, you know, the boiler in this baby... is a humac model p54/ 81 3.

## forget your jammies, mrs. packard?
i sleep in the nude.

## does it match my dress?
it's a nightmare.

## what's mole's story?

if we could blow the top off of that thing, we'd have a straight shot to the surface.

## who are these guys?
they gotta be atlanteans.

## dices linguam romae.
what?

## pardon, mademoiselle?
on behalf of my crew... may i say it is an honor to be welcomed to your city.

## commander?
you presume much... to think you are welcome here.

## may i respectfully request that we stay one night, sir?
that would give us time to rest, resupply... and be ready to travel by morning.

## so, how'd it go?
well, the king and his daughter don't exactly see eye to eye.

## you are a scholar, are you not?
judging from your diminished physique... and large forehead... you are suited for nothing else.

## when did the flood waters recede?

## well, ok, uh, how did you get here?
well, i mean, not you personally... but your your culture.

## i mean, how did all of this end up down here?

yes.

## how is it you found your way to this place?
yes, yes, i can read atlantean, just like you.

## you can't, can you?

## what does the writing say about that?

## oh, you mean this?
besides, you're the one who got us here.

## what's to know?
it's big.

## helga, what do you think?
knowing that, i'd double the price.

## where's the crystal chamber?
you will destroy yourselves.

## all right, thatch, what's next?
ok, there's a giant crystal... hovering 150 feet above our heads... over a bottomless pit of water.

## doesn't anything surprise you?
the only thing that surprises me...

## what's happening?
look, all it says here... is that the crystal is alive somehow.

## what did she say?
i don't know.

## i guess this is how it ends, huh?
fine.

## but that's what it's all about, right?
money.

## how's he doing?
not good, i'm afraid.

## where is my daughter?
well, she she...

## what?
in times of danger... the crystal will choose a host... one of royal blood... to protect itself... and its people.

## so this thing is alive?
in a way.

## what's going to happen to kida?
if she remains bonded to the crystal... she could be lost to it forever.

## me?
return the crystal.

## excuse me?
i followed you in, and i'll follow you out.

## oh, my decision?
well, you did set the camp on fire... and drop us down that big hole.

## who told you that?
a fella by the name of thaddeus thatch.

## where are you going?
i'm going after rourke.

## milo, what do you think you are doing?
just follow my lead.

## just gently.
we get it, ok?

## how is this done?
all you got to do is use the crystals.

## well, do you have any suggestions?
yeah.

## any last words?
yeah.

## uhh.

## milo?
atlantis will honor your names forever.

## now, you sure you want to stay?

nope.

## what happened to helga?
well, we lost her when a flaming zeppelin come down on her.

## i've said many times, why don't you walk closer?

## who is it?
i'm here to deliver some food.

## you ordered that?
no, i haven't.

## have you come to the wrong place?
no. 7.

## no. 7?

i didn't know being delivery boy must answer so many questions.

## yes, what's wrong?
sorry, i'm an undercover.

## how's that?
i'm fine, i'm still alive.

## shall i cook dinner for you?
just then i...

## didn't you play as the leading actor?
i don't care whether you're a leading actor or an extra.

## you're dating someone else?
because you guys are brother and sister.

## mood begins from your heart, then goes to the outside of your body... and returns to the heart, got it?
yes, got it.

## why don't you play it?
forget it, i'm not talented in acting.

## are they?
hurry up.

## for what?
i'll play it.

## are you talented then?
i am.

## stop fighting, eat potato chips, why fighting for?
there're really many audience.

## do you think it incredible that mr collins could procure any woman's good opinion, because he didn't succeed with you?
charlotte, i didn't mean...

## though you may, perhaps?
this came just now from netherfield, ma'am.

## is it not clear enough?
caroline bingley believes her brother is indifferent to me and she means to put me on my guard.

## i suppose you'll keep him all to yourself again?
oh, indeed he is.

## with such narratives to hand, who would read novels?
i've heard again from caroline bingley.

## when is it your turn, lizzy?
you can't be long outdone by jane, when here are officers enough in meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country.

## jane, what if you were to go to town?
aunt and uncle gardiner would gladly take you with them to gracechurch street after christmas.

## why would you have me go to london, lizzy?
no reason.

## nonsense, we made good time.
a change of scene and society?

## how do you do, fanny?
very ill, edward.

## have you brought us some presents?
i see you've not changed, lydia.

## why, have i not grown?
aye, in everything but good sense.

## may i present mr wickham to you, aunt?
i understand you come from derbyshire, mr wickham.

## do you know the country?
very well.

## are you acquainted with the family?
indeed they are, sir william.

## the two eldest in particular, perhaps?
indeed, indeed.

## when do you go into kent?
we shall spend the wedding night at lucas lodge, and then travel to hunsford on friday.

## you will write to me, lizzy?
i believe i am not likely to leave kent for some time.

## lizzy, will you promise to be one of the party?
you will be as welcome as either of them.

## is she to come to hunsford with us?
her name is mary king.

## she's not very pretty, is she?
beauty is not the only virtue, maria.

## did you think her pretty, mamma?
no indeed, she has nothing to any of you.

## i've missed our conversations.
and guess who else?

## i hear i am to congratulate you on your forthcoming betrothal to miss king?
you must despise me.

## never a thought of what your poor parents will suffer in your absence?
it is a pleasure i could well forego, father, as i think you know.

## what of your cousin mr collins and the famous lady catherine de bourgh?
as a connoisseur of human folly, i thought you impatient to be savouring these delights.

## observe that closet, cousin elizabeth.
all of it?

## what do you say to that?
well...

## is it not the very essence of practicality and convenience?
lady catherine de bourgh herself was kind enough to suggest that these shelves be fitted.

## nothing is too small to be beneath her notice, is it not, my dear?
she is a very attentive neighbour.

## that is generosity itself, is it not, maria?
her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us.

## is that necessary?
perhaps not, but i confess i encourage him in that as well.

## and you prefer to sit in this parlour?
yes.

## who, lizzy?
mark the windows.

## do you have brothers and sisters, miss bennet?
yes, ma'am, i am the second of five sisters.

## are any of your younger sisters out?
yes, ma'am, all of them.

## your youngest sisters must be very young?
yes, ma'am, my youngest is not sixteen.

## sir william, wouldn't you agree?
with three younger sisters grown up, your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.

## i could grow almost as fond of these woods and hills as you have.
mrs collins, did i tell you of lady metcalf's calling on me yesterday to thank me for sending her miss pope?

## at last, sir?
i've heard much of you, and the praise hasn't been exaggerated.

## this you do not find at rosings park?
my aunt does talk a great deal, but seldom requires a response.

## i believe you play and sing?
a little, and very ill.

## what do you think offends him?
i hope your family is in good health.

## have you not seen her?
no.

## why should you be?
i always believe in first impressions, and his good opinion once lost, is lost forever.

## so you see, it is a hopeless case, is it not, colonel fitzwilliam?
you will never play really well, miss bennet, unless you practise more.

## do you mean to frighten me, mr darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me?
i won't be alarmed.

## i'm not afraid of you.
that is ungenerous of him, is it not?

## i fear i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers.
what can you accuse him of?

## why a man of sense and education, who has lived in the world, should be ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?
i...

## i was just writing a letter to my sister jane in london.
what are you talking of?

## mr bingley and his sisters were well, i hope, when you left london?
perfectly so, i thank you.

## i understand mr bingley has not much idea for ever returning to netherfield?
it is probable that he may spend little time there in the future.

## what is fifty miles of good road?
yes, an easy distance.

## shall we take this way together?
with pleasure.

## do you know mr bingley and his sisters?
a little.

## did mr darcy give his reasons for this interference?
i understand there were some very strong objections to the lady.

## you're disposed to think his interference officious?
i don't see what right mr darcy had to determine and direct in what way his friend was to be happy.

## miss bennet, are you unwell?
a sudden headache.

## you're sure?
i cannot begin to count the occasions on which her ladyship has impressed upon me the importance of punctuality...

## will you not sit down?
in vain i have struggled.

## and this is all the reply i am to expect?
i have every reason in the world to think ill of you.

## can you deny that you have done it?
i have no wish to deny it.

## and this is your opinion of me?
my faults by this calculation are heavy indeed.

## to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so below my own?
you are mistaken, mr darcy.

## what's so fucking funny?
hey, keep laughing at me and i'll kill you.

## you remember the old brick building on chester avenue?
there's a million brick buildings on...

## what about it?

## how much action?
cosimo says 300 grand.

## how much money did you wake up with in your pocket this morning?
fifty five cents.

## that negro who hides his sister?
he's a nut case, but he always needs dough.

## how hard can it be to find a mullinski?
you gotta know somebody that could use the dough.

## what the fuck does that mean?
it means what it means.

## why give a shit?

## what are you doing in my jammies?
i'm your new roommate.

## bart, have you ever eaten a tootsie pop?

## nelson, doesn't that hurt your teeth?
my teeth hurt all the time.

## papa, can you help me not be frightened?
looking at the skies i seem to see a million eyes...

nothing.

## but talking about the problem is the first step towards the solution, right?
don't have a stegosaurus, man.

## remember when you bought your car?
tell me that.

## a deal?
this isn't a used car we're talking about.

## oh, don't you get it?
we just got our baby back.

## what's up?
hi.

## so you think bree punched andrew in the face?
i don't either, but on the other hand, she spanked my kids, she lied about her drinking and i once saw her bitch slap her mother in law.

we have andrew saying that it's systematic physical abuse.

## how are we supposed to know the real truth?
because i remember being 17.

fake.

## what's this?

## paper folding?
i was hoping you wouldn't know what that was.

## you're going?
you can't walk in this wood on your own.

## how about a bite to eat?

nothing.

## a letter for ella?
the prince's coronation ball.

## he's invited that insolent little snip?

## what's going on?
edgar's soldiers rounding up elfin singers to perform at the coronation.

## for what?
to go to law school.

## why not?
there were no laws against it when your father was king.

## what?
you're about to become king.

## why are they treated like slaves?
i'm sure my uncle doesn't know about this.

## no grudges, eh?
well, i thought that maybe this would be a good time to possibly have a heart to heart.

## excuse me. ls lucinda perriweather here?
too late, sweetheart.

## do you know where i can find her?
last i heard, she was somewhere living in lamia.

## do you know where the bathroom is?

## are you singing at the coronation?
heck, no.

## what are they doing here?
i don't mean to rush, but now i really need to find my godmother, and slannen, too.

## where is he?
my uncle'll send the guards to find him.

## and who might this charming young lady be?
this is ella.

## so, i trust your journey was pleasant?
we had a little run in with some ogres, but char got the best of them.

## so, char, might i trouble you for a moment?
the crown maker needs to see you in your chambers for a fitting.

## we'll talk about it after your coronation, yes?
fine, but we will talk.

## this... this ella of frell?
come with me.

## stepsister, actually.
what now?

## how about that your eyeballs remain inside your head?

## after the coronation he'll need to take a queen, and shall we say... his hand in marriage?
queen olive.

## i hope you've found everything to your satisfaction?
yes, thank you.

## and while you're about it, why don't you pat your head and rub your tummy at the same time?

## can i help you?
i'm looking for lucinda perriweather.

## do you know where i could find her?
nope.

## what are you doing?
never mind.

## you want me to go back in there?
you'll need all the help you can get.

## what's going on?
i already told you, i can't tell you.

## where's your little friend?
yes.

## would you stop that?
when you steal from here, you are stealing from me now.

## this is my future home, isn't it?
oh.

## are you kidding?
this isn't the salad bar at brelly's.

## do i know you, child?
ella of frell.

## take it back?
i don't think so.

## you don't like my gift?
fine.

## did i chain your butt up to this tree, huh?
well...

## huh?
but you...

## aren't i fabulous?
now, look at you.

## what?
go get down with the prince.

## us?
it sounds even more wonderful when you say it.

## then why did you write me that letter?
tell me how you really feel about me.

## ls that what this is about?
ella, that's crazy.

## the hall of mirrors?
when i was little, my father brought me in here.

## ella, what's wrong?
i wish i could tell you.

## no?
no.

## your family?
because those things aren't important.

## you let me worry about all this, hm?
you just concentrate on tomorrow's coronation.

## why not call them in now and take over the whole kingdom like we planned?
first we must find a way to get rid of the prince.

## are you ok?
i could kiss you.

## edgar's done this?
we've gotta go in there and stop him.

## her what?
her lawyer, numbskull.

## well, can we at least take him to go?
put the nice man down.

## are you ok?
i'm fine, but char might not be.

## a pumpkin?
ok, maybe i did try to kill you, but that wasn't me.

## what?
maybe it was me, but it wasn't my fault.

## edgar's trying to kill me?
yes.

## what?
that can't be true.

## you killed my father, your own brother.
who are you gonna believe?

## how could l?
i wanted something, he was in my way, i got rid of him.

## marry me?
yeah, i just... have to pee.

## what is it?
doesn't matter what it is, we blew the door so we could get everyone inside this thing so they'd be safe, that plan is not gonna work.

## 40 feet down?
50 tops.

## you gonna lower people down there one by one?
they're waiting for us to come back and tell them what to do, so let's forget about the harnesses.

## i'm gonna go get the dynamite that we didn't use, and we're heading back to the caves.
jack?

## so how about you pack it up john?
sure, of course.

## why don't you wanna go down there jack?
female, late 20's no i. d. she coded twice on the way over here.

## where's the other one?

## what have we got here?
female, late 20's auto accident.

## what the hell is that thing?
yeah, alone.

## where's the driver of the s. u. v.?

## what did she say?
she said she has to dance at her wedding.

## what?
nothing.

## has anyone seen vincent?
the dog.

## where are you going?
i lost the damn dog.

## well you got a point there.
why'd you do that?

## i guess i was just excited to get inside, i mean, that's why we came here isn't it?
that's why we went all the way out to the black rock, and why we got the dynamite to blow the hatch.

## or, maybe it was just our destiny, right john?
maybe.

## guys?
ah, it's the hatch door, you'd better see this.

## why do you wanna get down there so bad?
ly.

## why, because you wanna drop into a hatch that's been locked from the inside, by a foot thick steel door that says quarantine?
well look at the bright side, damage is done.

## bright side?
and if jack thinks i've lost it, i can't blame him really...

## wonder what jack thinks he saw?
you should go ahead man, don't want locke making time with your girl.

## there you go.
really?

## what?
yeah it's kind of a long story.

## you were in a psych ward?
i'm not crazy.

## hurly, they're numbers.
so, what that's it, that's all?

## what that thing where doctors make you feel better just by talking to you?
the car that i hit, the other driver was older.

## what's happened to me?
you have a fracture dislocation of your thorasic lumbar spine, with multiple crushed vertibrae.

## you did something wrong?
you're frowning.

## where?
everywhere.

## but, that doesn't matter now because that's not gonna work, there's no way for all of us to get down in there tonight.
what, what whispers?

## where's doctor artz?
ahh, he didn't make it.

## there are no others, we already had this conversation.
did you see them?

## i promise.
what the hell would you know about it?

## john, what are you doing?
i'm getting some cable.

## what for?
it's for the hatch, i'm going in.

## you really think that's the smartest thing to do right now john?
i doubt it, in fact you're right, the safest thing is to stay here, wait for morning, wait for these others to see if they ever show up...

## believe what?
that everything's gonna be ok.

## there's a glass?
you did a good thing, saying what you said.

## live together die alone right?
right.

## when is it?
you need to know that there's a chance sarah might very well need professional care for the rest of her life.

## what, like she won't be able to go to the bathroom by herself?
come here.

## i was waiting for you.
you're invited ok?

## so you want me to go down first?
hell, you're lighter.

## not too tight?
i got it.

## you're going back?
yeah.

## what about all that stuff you said about waiting till morning, and watching the sunrise?
i changed my mind.

## does this hurt?
you haven't sprained it then.

## what do you know about sprains anyway?
i was almost a doctor once.

## excuse?
for running like the devil's chasing you.

## training for what?
for a race round the world.

## a girl right?
a patient.

## what's her name?
her name's sarah.

## do to her?
you must have done something worthy of this self flagellation.

## what if you did fix her?
i didn't.

## but what if you did?
you don't know what you're talking about man.

## why not?
because with her situation, that would be a miracle, brother.

## ahh, and you don't believe in miracles?
right, well then, i'm gonna give you some advice anyway.

## lift it up?
your ankle, you gotta keep it elevated.

## am i alive?
yeah, yeah you're alive.

## what?
it's when you run all the steps in every section of a stadium, up and down.

## why would you do that?
umm, i'm intense.

## d'you finish?
no, i hurt my ankle.

## is kevin here?
my fiance.

## you gonna tell me how it went?

## is that you?
i was holding back, because i didn't feel that was a human being out there.

## how's it hanging, man?
slightly to the left, bro.

## what's up?
nothing.

## any different than the last three?
totally.

## that flip trick?
this close to landing it.

## ln the meantime, wanna buy something?
i wish i could, dude.

## what's up, man?
bro.

## which one do you want?
i don't care.

## do you remember me?
probably not.

## you going to the demo later on?
hell, yeah.

## for free?
yeah, for free.

## for real?
all right.

## how about we go with one of those elements, like bam got?
dude, for you, i can go that board $ 1 40.

## and?
and nothing.

## you know what?
matt listened to your crap, and look where that got him.

excuse me, everyone.

## mom?
sorry.

## nice timing, huh?
tell your mom you're getting married on the day she gets divorced.

## why does love make people crazy?
you didn't tell me you were doing it.

## can you believe it?
no.

## you're gonna let yourself turn into mush over something like sex?
yeah.

## your mom wants to get married?
well, she wants to fall in love, halley.

## where were you trying to get to in that canoe?
no comment.

## no comment?
i don't speak to the press.

## yeah, and anything i say can and will be used against me, right?
i would never use anything against you.

## it's you, right?
wdyg's coolest dj.

## that's hard to do without a mirror, isn't it?
honey, you keep getting prettier every day.

## i have no idea how you could say that, cause... you definitely don't see me every day, do you?
and yesterday, my god, i was so ugly, and last wednesday... that sucked, too.

## i'm kidding, okay?
it's blank inside.

## you know something?
you're not too funny.

## is that michael?
for a redhead from...

## sneaking up on me?
hi, halley.

## you remember my name?
sure.

## band?
i would never sign up for band.

## what's wrong with band?
i don't play anything.

## why don't you just give it a shot before you decide anything?
daddy dog.

## lorna, you up there?
hi, len.

## should we tell everyone our little secret?
careful.

## baby, you sure this is the time?
i am bursting at the seams to tell everyone we're eloping.

## that is your father's show, right?
i just love it.

## your father and your sister are getting married?
yeah.

## you didn't know about your dad getting married?
yes, i did.

## me?
i've had to go to, like, five between my parents.

## listen, m. t. wasn't giving you a hard time back there, was she?
mrs. toussaint and i... we're on close terms.

## you never saw star wars?
no, i saw it.

## well, that's your loss, isn't it?
because the jedi mind trick is when you tell someone what to think, and they think it.

## now what do you say?
okay.

## you didn't really start a fire, did you?
i told you you'd ask me.

## what kind of logic is that?
it's logical logic.

## haven't you noticed when the opposite sex gets together, eventually someone ends up getting hurt?
i am, too... boycotting.

## he didn't give any warning when you went dinner?
none.

## she was at that dinner?
no.

## can't you picture walking down this aisle?
in a coffin.

## what do you think?
well, i like it.

## clean?
it's not... it's not pretty, it's not intimate, it's not romantic.

## you think planning the most important day of our lives is a hassle?
it hasn't even been that long.

## wouldn't michael look cool in that?
hey, i did a good job.

## that's not the point, though, okay?
enjoy him, and fool around with him.

## maybe go by and look at it?
or maybe...

## see?
they don't even like each other.

## what are you looking for?
these dishes, they're perfect.

## isn't he adorable?
he's cute.

## you hear me?
guys, back up.

## give him some air, all right?
call the doctor.

## what do you think?
i think it's 100 degrees out.

## what am i supposed to do?
the only black clothes i have are winter clothes.

## does that sound crazy?
this was a bad idea.

## can you believe what she's wearing?
that's, like, so disrespectful.

## and do you, lorna p. queen, take this old guy len to be your lawfully wedded husband for all the rest of your days?
i do.

## and who do you think you are?
just because you've got great petals.

## how was it?
it was great... if you happen to be the devil and enjoy human pain.

## was dad that much a loser when you guys got married?
i'm sorry.

## how can you promise you're gonna feel the same way forever?
things do sometimes change, halley.

## what?
you'll be going to college soon.

## here you go.
where did you get that?

## you're afraid to go out with me because you might like me?
no, but that's a good theory, i guess, if you want to protect your fragile male ego.

## you jedi mind tricked me.
rejection?

## halley, is that you out there?
close your eyes.

## who are you talking to?
i'm sorry, i...

## we're not gonna stay up very late, okay?
at least do it inside.

## what's wrong?
maybe it's a false reading.

## what am i gonna do?
so you take the car without my permission in the middle of the night on some kind of joy ride.

## shouldn't i be getting paid to wear a dress this ugly?
i'm sorry if you hate my taste and you think it's so awful you have to be in my wedding, but you are my sister.

## okay, ashley, i'm sorry, all right?
it's just...

## you know?
i look awful.

## ashley, would you drive halley home?
it stole my money, so, just...

## what's your pleasure?
diet coke sounds good.

## williams, again?
nice to meet you.

## aren't you gonna wear lipstick?
you sound like mom.

## you guys know you're wearing the same dress, right?
unbelievable.

## halley, could you please wear something a little more feminine?
because the warshers are really traditional.

## sweetheart, do you need the loo?
grandma, no.

## are you smoking the cannabis again?
i had a little headache.

## could you ring the bell?
i do get headaches a lot.

## does anyone else hear wind chimes or is it just me?
this is a total disaster.

## can i say i'm a vegetarian?
no.

## tell me, how lost were you before you were found?
because you look like a lady who doesn't get lost very often.

## what was the name of that character?
ashley.

## well, you holler if you need any help at all, understand?
i want this to be a memorable affair.

## which way to the bathroom?
down the hall and to your left.

## isn't it a surprise... our children choosing to get married so young?
i always thought lewis would take his time to find the right person.

## young lady?
open the door.

## are you all right?
lovely evening.

## what are you talking about?
your mom obviously doesn't want you to get married.

## where are we?
you'll see when we get there.

## you like it?
yeah.

## please?
come on, macon.

## but what is normal, anyway?
growing up with my mom sure wasn't.

## maybe being abnormal is what's normal... right?
yeah, like you and macon.

## didn't i explain?
i'm a civil war reenactor... a little hobby.

## would dinner tonight be too fast?
yes.

## friends?
friends.

## this is how you conduct yourself in your own home?
you said it... my own home.

## you know what?
maybe if you had a little bit more fun, you wouldn't be in the position you're in right now.

## where is all this attitude coming from?
this is not like you.

## like me?
you don't even know me.

## mom, he's not strange, okay?
his name is macon.

## guess what?
exclamation point.

## why don't you try telling michael's parents what you really feel?
macon land.

## she doesn't know how to smile?
maybe she doesn't want to.

## here's to the new year, right?
yeah, right.

## what's up with you?
i lost my damn earring.

## who wants to see my ferret?
dude, i have one.

## you know?
yeah, my mom's a bookkeeper in her doctor's office, but... don't worry.

## really?
they went out all summer.

## did they?
yeah, and he was completely in love with her.

## what's wrong?
i'm sorry.

## halley, where are you going?
ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

## what was that all about?
i thought you wanted us to be together.

## any word from him?
no.

## disappearing?
hey.

## you really don't get it, do you?
i'm really not in the mood to wait for you to grow up.

## my... are you okay?
hi, halley.

## you think i'm doing those?
i am not doing those.

## and how would you know that?
friday night she sneaks out to have sex with steve.

## she told you that?
she didn't want you to know.

## top of the morning to you.
god, why do people think that i can't handle the truth?

## how is she?
sweetie.

## underwear?
it was nothing.

## don't promises we make to each other mean anything?
of course they mean something, lewis.

## you know what else?
don't talk to me that way.

## what's going on?
i think they're breaking up.

## okay?
for a while there, i thought i'd never get married.

## hello?
honey, it's their mother calling from virginia.

## do you think she's okay in there?
it has been a while.

## grandma, are you all right?
yes, i'm just smoking a little marijuana.

## i do?
yes.

## you remember when we went to see our comet together?
halley was too young to remember that.

## why does no one trust me to know what i know anymore?
god.

## who told you about that?
he's not terrible looking.

## life of my heart... once again... will you marry me?
yes.

## for?
macon's a really great guy.

## elizabeth gunderson and me?
no, we're just...

## friends?
yeah.

## no, it's fine because we had our thing, and it was fun... until it wasn't anymore, right?
no, that's not it.

## would you listen to me for a sec?
and to my bride.

## you taught it to me, remember?
so, you know.

## lorna, honey, any words of wisdom coming from you, my very own newlywed?
waterproof mascara.

## security?
i don't know how to get you to listen, but maybe...

## i'm not too old to wear pink?
no.

## the rings?
dear friends, let us ask god to bless these rings as a symbol of their love everlasting.

## right now?
scarlett's having the baby.

## okay?
it doesn't get any better than this.

## me?
no, no.

## miss smith?
it's okay.

## so, do you hate me?
not you, per se.

## you just hate the way i walk and talk and look?
no.

## that jedi mind trick thing?
i hate that.

## isn't it?
it has to be.

## as long as you're gonna kill me with flying ice, does it matter?
excuse me, everyone.

## mom?
sorry.

## nice timing, huh?
tell your mom you're getting married on the day she gets divorced.

## why does love make people crazy?

pretend you're me.

## see?
i told you you'd ask me.

it's logical logic.

he kissed me.

## where, baby?
and he stripped me naked.

## what did you do, baby?

## can you get here?

## yeah, maybe enough to buy a new car, and then what?
oh, that's funny.

## what i mean is, do you think she'd go behind your back?
step aside, mert.

## what did you say?
thirty five thousand.

## tax free?
tax free.

## so i can end up in here with you?

## as for andy...... he spent that break hunkered in the shade...... a strange little smile on his face...... watching us drink his beer.

## want a cold one?
no, thanks.

## me?
i think he did it just to feel normal again...... if only for a short while.

## what?
civilized.

for the same price, you can buy 200, 000 acres of prime sahara wasteland.

## too remote?
oh, i understand.

## feeling a little cramped?
and it's all within your price range.

## oh, you like books?
i have a little collection of first edition novels.

## this leads to where?
i thought you realized.

## as in two floors for the price of one?
i believe it's right there in the listing sheet.

## were there, like, a slew of murders up there or something?
no, there's just a sweet, little old lady that lives upstairs.

## a tenant?
mm hmm.

## she's gotta be close to 100 years old.
so, rent control means we can't kick her out, right?

## mrs. connelly?
it may take her a while.

## mrs. connelly?
kenneth.

## how you feeling today, mrs. connelly?
i don't feel too good, kenneth.

## three fireplaces?
guys, the place sounds incredible.

## it's a duplex?
yes.

## did you bring it?
oh, yeah.

## is this the latest in the don piper mystery series?
fresh off the presses.

## what is it?
go ahead.

## four months?
mm hmm.

## besides, do you realize how much the duplex is gonna be worth once we get both floors?
i know how much it costs.

## a bazillion?
that's an incredible return.

## come on, alex, what better way to finish your novel than in your own 19th century oak writer's nook?
it would be nice not to write at starbucks with the other novelists.

## really?
yeah.

## what are you doing?
oh, i'm just taking a few little pictures for research.

## are you all right?
yeah.

## why do you ask, dear?
well, because the last time we saw you, you were quite ill.

## what do you do, alan?
alex.

## oh, what's it about?
well, i like to call it an urban epic.

## so, when are you two planning on having children?
soon.

## really?
we must say good night.

## how could you?
a macaw.

## don't you think that as landlords, we have some legal right to see the back of her apartment if we want to?
i mean, i'll look it up on the internet.

## who is it?
hi, it's alex.

## are you going to eat your peach cobbler?
no, you don't want all that.

## why don't you share it with me?
everybody's asking me about fiber.

## pardon?
alex.

## could you give me a hand with the garbage?
we don't want to be feeding the mice.

## what in heaven's name are you doing with me drawers?
yes.

## well, if you mean i'll have it soon, why don't you say i'll have it soon?
oh, mr. peabody.

## how did that get in there?
ohh.

## alex?
hey.

## how was work?
oh, herman's freaking out, as usual.

## were you napping?
no, i was just rearranging my book collection.

## in the dark?
and then i closed my eyes for a second.

## is this dinner?
mm hmm.

## did you get, like, five or six million pages written?
more like five or six words.

## really?
yeah.

## what is that?
oh, i picked up a few things on the way home.

## do you love it?
yes.

## how much was it?
it doesn't seem to cover much of an area.

## it's an original pablo flinch.
that was 200 bucks?

## really?
cool.

## is it, like, a mayan guacamole bowl or something?
it's a stool.

## 471 bucks.
what are we, hobbits?

## you were here three hours?
yeah.

## i can rip the pipes out of the wall.
how could you not hear banging?

## what?
i gave you my business card.

## do you want to count it?
remember, if she bothers you, just lay down the law.

## what is that?
psychology.

## you know i'm working on a book, right?
and this book is due in about three weeks.

## and my editor is expecting it on her desk at that time, okay?
it's a contractual deadline.

## so let's just pretend that i'm a lawyer, okay?
this is my office, and unless it's a really, really super important emergency, okay, between the hours of 9:00 and 6:00, i'm not here.

## and then after 6:00, i'm here, okay?
i completely understand.

## okay, have a good day, all right?
it's just...

## what is it?
i bought a copy of your book yesterday, and i wondered if you'd sign it.

## yeah?
i know we've just had this discussion, but i was wondering if the firm of rose & rose could accompany an old lady to the pharmacy.

## okay, good?
oh, blueberries.

## she manipulated you?
she's very crafty.

## tomorrow's gonna be better, because you know why?
it's gonna be saturday, and that's our day off, and we're gonna get to sleep in.

## okay?
yeah.

## hello, dear.
i promise everything will be better tomorrow, okay?

## let's go out shopping.
are those musical instruments?

## i'll deliver it this afternoon?
remington royal.

## how much were they asking for it?
50 bucks.

## isn't it great?
cool.

## what does it do?
it's there to be decorative and pretty and aesthetically pleasing.

## so what do we need a daybed for?
oh, for all your napping.

## hey, what's in the bag?
answer to our prayers.

## you know what i just realized that we forgot to do?
oh, my god.

## hey, where are you going?
oh, now's my chance.

## what are you gonna do?
the answer to our problems.

## what does it do?
when she falls asleep, we can control her tv.

## if you hear her coming, knock on the pipe, okay?
like, make a noise.

## i'm back again, aren't i?
guess what i've got in the bag.

## shall we have a bit of music?
hold on a sec.

## mrs. connelly?
oh, nancy.

## what happened to you?
you were supposed to be the lookout.

## ready?
yeah.

## you didn't leave the box up there or anything, did you?
nancy kendricks.

## can't you ask alex?
i knocked and knocked.

## where is it?
yes.

## did you check it?
yes.

## is it, like, 800, 900 square feet?
no, it's, like, 1, 800.

## how's the ending turning out?
the ending is gonna be great.

## i'm only mid level?
right now.

## did you bring that guy with the girl in the leopard thing?
oh, that's chick.

## what, is he a detective or something?
no.

## you brought a hit man into the party?
relax.

## and what do you do, chick?
i'm a pornographer.

## herman?
being a landlord doesn't give you the right to enter your tenant's premises anytime you feel like it.

## hey, alex, right?
hey, chick.

## how you doing?
brought you a housewarming gift.

## did you happen to see the restaurant hot list?
oh, my god.

## alex?
oh.

## when did napping become against the law?
honey, i can't work here.

## doing all the little errands, the chores she asks you to do?
i don't think you could take it.

## nancy?
hello, mrs. connelly.

## is there something, mrs. connelly?
oh, i guess you could say there was something.

## nancy, could you help me?
i think i found the leavings of a mouse.

## nancy?
okay.

## what is it, mrs. connelly?
little dickey's caught in the dumbwaiter shaft.

## i wish we could just kick her out.
well, how did he get there?

## what if we tried being nice to her?
maybe we could get her a gift.

## a gift?
yeah.

## we ask her?
yeah.

## just ask her?
maybe it'll take a little begging, but nicely.

## don't you think you'd be more comfortable with people who are more in your demographic?
in sunny miami beach.

## the emerald isle, hmm?
back to the old sod.

## most likely they have television now?
oh.

## really?
yes.

## what are you doing?
you were choking on a chocolate.

## sexual predator?
and to think they want to have children.

## what can i get you?
listen, i got 12 hours to finish this book.

## you threw her down the stairs?
no.

## really?
just, you know, snapping her neck or electrocuting her.

## are you sure it was a rat, mrs. connelly?
i saw its face.

## you saw its face?
all right, let's see if we can't find this big, bad rat.

## you sure it might not have been a dust bunny?
okay.

## would you sprinkle some salt on the steps?
they're terribly icy.

## can you believe it?
no, i can't.

## in breach?
i have the crushed powerbook.

## do you have the shark?
yes, we do.

## how do you feel?
like i'm knocking on death's door.

## how are you?
oh, i'm grand.

## but how are the two of you?
you look rather sallow.

## so, did you have a nice thanksgiving dinner?
oh, yes, dear.

## i don't?
it's really stuffed up.

## how much can we get, kenneth?
that depends on how far you're willing to drop the price.

## so you're saying that we're stuck in this hellhole?
yeah.

## how huge?
huge, huge.

## we're just totally screwed, right?
yeah.

## do you think that jean would ever give you a second chance?
no.

## roger.
you got some poopy on your diapie?

## alex?
tripped on the rug.

## you sure you know what you're doing?
i rewired the lamp in your office.

## did you remember to blow out the pilot for the oven?
oh.

## isn't it soothing?
alex.

## what has happened to your face?
oh, i just fell asleep in one of those tanning machines.

## how are you doing, mutton head?
i'm almost done.

## right?
right.

## where are you going?
a little insurance.

## honey, mr. peacock's gonna have to take one for the team, okay?
that's it.

## fiddling with her pipes, huh?
now, that's another fine right there.

## for what?
you can't plumb without a license in new york city.

## are you sassing me, mr. rose?
he's not sassing you.

## you got it?
it makes my viewing so much easier.

## what?
gun.

## so this is what it's come to?
i guess so.

## you feel that?
yes.

## where is she?
maybe she's in her chair.

## do you know what, dears?
i think i've enough warmth as it is.

## what's the easiest way into this hag's place?
well, we found the dumbwaiter to be rather effective.

## so, chick, how much is this gonna set us back?
25k.

## when do you think you could do it?
i'll do it thursday night.

## christmas eve?
yeah.

## got it?
got it.

## did you get the money?

## want to know how?

## that is good.

## what can we do for you?
he's doing his job.

## what?
here we go.

## you all right?
yeah.

## where's little dickey?
dickey, dickey.

## so how's the new place?
it's cute.

## i told you they'd fix it up, didn't i?
friedmans, meet alex and nancy.

## honey, won't this be perfect for your sleep disorder?
i'm drowsy already.

## hey, who wants to run upstairs and say hello?
well, we should get going.

## do you think she's up in heaven?
well, i'll tell you something.

## what are you talking about?
we give you everything, ma.

## but did they live happily ever after?
well, read the book.

## not for you?
for the same price, you can buy 200, 000 acres of prime sahara wasteland.

## too remote?
oh, i understand.

## feeling a little cramped?
and it's all within your price range.

## biscotte?
his best friend.

## do you know the reason?
a mystery.

## it seems you are again thirsty, huh?
vronique passavant.

## what could have happened that she didn't want to talk to him anymore?
i suppose he was unfaithful and she never forgave him.

## oh, right.
what are the red files about?

## it's a real mess.
suppose that the highest person is yourself... then mr. rouvires and i would have clearance, right?

## can i help you?

so what, every so often the president can give it to deserving soldiers.

## is that okay for you?
yes, try to encourage her, it would give her appetite.

## what for?
to distract you a little.

## do you drink wine now?
a glass of wine gives strength without putting money in the doctor's pocket.

he has a wooden hand.

can you say that again?

## you see?

## what exactly?
tina lombardi knows something which eludes us.

## me?
it was his idea.

## so they didn't see each other until they were in twilight bingo?
twilight bingo is where everything finishes.

## that he was the only carpenter, no?
i have to return to paris.

## again?
the inheritance of your parents will go away like smoke.

## excuse me, where is elodie gordes?
that's the woman with the carrots.

## elodie gordes?
here, for you.

## was it because of you?
you exaggerate, i do not have anything to tell him.

## there is no letter for me?
only the newspaper...

## at least him, he sleeps in pyjamas.
the president has opened an investigation into the condemned men of twilight bingo?

## you are already a thief, and now you are a pyromaniac.
eh?

## are all those for me?
no, just this one.

## do you want to drink something?
even if i were pregnant, we would have to wait 9 months... by then the war would already be over.

## don't you have any compassion?
then one day i found a letter of clevert bouquette, aka bastoche, in the letterbox.

## i made some coffee, do you want one?
oh yes, it would be nice.

## do you want sugar?
no, thanks.

## it is mother of pearl?

## do you understand?
that is why it's important that i find clestin poux.

## clestin poux, road terror.
well it's really a great pity, you know?

## is this your announcement?
mathilde clenched her fists together, it was all she could do to avoid shaking, crying or looking like an idiot.

## the last time you saw manech, was he alive?
it was impossible not to see him, instead of hiding he was carving an m on the trunk of a charred tree.

## the albatross?
albatross.

## did you give him the glove?
red, thick wool.

## but, are you sure manech is dead?
the one infected with gangrene.

## sixpence?

## why are the five condemned listed as soldiers of the battalion?
we are following orders.

## careful clestin, you are not in a sidecar.
will you taste my plum pie?

## men, they are like children, eh?
as long as they don't play at being soldiers... tell berney i want to liquidate everything by the first days of march.

## don't you think?
it might be in code.

## i ran into some stretcher carriers that had just seen them.
and bastoche?

## why?
nothing...

## there it was, 100 metres ahead...... the german trench.
can i do something to make it up to you?

## the youngest looked like a boy.

all of them had one hand wrapped, i remember that but nothing on the other hand, i didn't see a glove.

## bright red?
intense red.

and why did lavrouye do that?

## biscotte?

## your highness, can you hear me?
oh, boy.

## what?
wait, wait.

## how can you be this way?
all you care about is building your summer home and filling it with stuff for you.

the spirits of the deceased who carried the geostigma...

## what will happen to this planet?

## sister?

it was the only way they could lose their virginity...... and be free to do what they wanted with other men.

## do you know what's so nice about doctors?
usually a lot less than people imagine.

## exactly?
where the rainbow ends.

## don't you want to go where the rainbow ends?

## what then?
women don't....

## lf you men only knew.
millions of years of evolution, right?

## you've never been jealous about me, have you?

oh.

## do you have any idea what it's like to have two people look at you... with total lust and devotion... through the same pair of eyes?
just shut up.

## what the hell, you know?
yes, yes, sweetheart.

## it's just a matter of practice before malkovich... is nothing more than another puppet hanging next to my work table.
what the fuck is going on?

## yeah, yada, yada, yada.
i'll tell you about it when i get home, okay?

## were you stoned?
yes.

## you know what?

## done with her, man?
tonight really freaked me out.

## exactly what, uh, type of service... does this company provide?
uh, uh, john malkovich.

## huh?
mr. malkovich, sir.

## simulates?

## what exactly does that mean?
well, it's hard to describe.

## what happens when a man goes through his own portal?
we'll see.

## malkovich, malkovich, malkovich?
malkovich, malkovich.

## how was it?
for most people, it's a rather pleasant experience.

## that's true.
do you understand?

## god, lotte, what have i become?
my wife in a cage with a monkey.

## what am i, some kind of monster?
i don't want to be a monster, lotte.

## maxine?
lotte.

## okay, that was craig inside of malkovich?

## it's confusing, you know?
this is a very confusing situation.

## listen, i should really get going, okay?
no.

## what?
i can explain about the portal, darling.

## how did you know it was me?
lotte called me.

## really?
well, i'm really sorry i did that, maxine... but i'm really in love with you, and i didn't know how else to be with you.

## apparently you can control this malkovich fellow now?
yes, i'm getting better all the time.

## yes?
hi, dr. lester.

## how's that?
much better, thank you.

## yes.
so, my dear... what is it that brings you to my doorway on such an inhospitable evening?

## and what prompted you to come to me with this issue?
well, when i was here with my husband for dinner...

## tell me... what is this strange power that malkovich exudes?
you've gotta help me understand because all i think about is wanting to be him.

## wanting to what?
wanting to be him.

## so dr. lester is such a vessel?
yes, he is.

## you still there, sweets?
hmm.

## what does that mean?

## you mean, with malkovich?
i'd love to see your work.

## really?
uh huh.

## it doesn't?
you have nothing to be ashamed about.

## so come on, how often?
three or four times a week.

## i know i'm an adult.
so you're renting it presumably to masturbate to, right?

## how old are you, exactly?
i'll be 26 in march.

## you still haven't learned some things aren't polite to talk about in public?
i get bored easily.

## why don't you just go out and get yourself a girlfriend?
i work all day, i hang out with my kid all night.

## so you'd rather hang out with your kid than get laid?
yeah.

## can i go home now?
no.

## when was the last time you had sex?
i would rather not disclose that information.

## why would you be embarrassed?
because it's been a long time.

## how long?
a long time.

## seven years?
since my wife died, yeah.

## are we done?
with this, for now.

## where are we going?
to your place.

## what, did you forget something?
no.

## don't you think i'm cute?
of course i think you're cute.

## well, then?
look, i'm not just celibate because of my daughter.

## would you lower your voice?
only somebody else is doing the touching and you're saving a $2 rental fee.

## pop?
uh, no, honey, it's me.

## why aren't you at work?
uh, because i had to come home and do...

## can we rent a movie?
yeah, sure, sure, sure.

## what do we do now?
i'm wet.

## like, do you plan on marrying him?

## it's on the house.
right, maya?

## even dirty dancing?
yeah.

## we can do sweeney todd for the show at school?
no, honey, that's too grown up.

## oh man, what am i gonna tell pop about you guys?
christ, greenie, you're always...

## let's talk about something else for a second, like this water main.
what, did ya get to third base?

## how bad is it?
definitely needs to be replaced.

## who are you, the holy father?
everybody knows i meant st peter.

## when i was down there, how many cars did you wave around?
three or four.

## three or four cars for the whole half hour i was down there?
well, it was rush hour.

## wasn't that your old job?
yes, baby, but...

## oh, you do, huh?
yeah.

## convincing a town to approve something that's already in their best interest?
that's just delayed common sense.

## just friends, right?
yeah, friends.

## and your father said you could do this for the show?
yep.

## why the hell would he ok you singing this shit?
because i saw him and maya naked in the shower.

## can i speak with an arthur brickman, please?
ollie.

## how are you?
good.

## you're serious?
i thought it was weird that you wanted to eat here.

## tough?
ollie, you called a roomful of press a bunch of jerk offs, and trashed a client who's one of the biggest movie stars on the planet.

## you wanna know how big?
when i left mandellkirschner, there were some firms that wouldn't even look at my resume because i...

## you know what, man?
forget i asked.

## i miss it so much, you know?
it's the only thing i was ever any good at.

## i can get her a nanny, you know?
it'll be like that whole fresh prince thing never even happened.

## me?
yeah.

## hello?
hey, arthur.

## you're kidding?
_ i'll pound three times three times...

## why do i have to sing your dad's part?
i'm supposed to be the guy who gets clipped.

## what the hell is that?
it means if daddy breaks a leg, then you do his part for him.

## yeah, what?
i was just on the phone with an old friend that i worked with at mandellkirschner.

## come on, when are you gonna learn?
well, smart guy, he just called me, said he sat down with his boss, sold me to his boss like i was the cure for cancer.

## won't that be fun?
but the subway's full of junkies and mole men.

## i mean, look at him, he's a mad dog.
what do i tell you?

## do you, pop?
that's all horseshit.

## except for the nights you're working, of course.
baby, remember when i took you to see sweeney todd?

## why don't you shut up for a second, ok?
i'm trying to talk to my daughter.

## yes, but daddy was just saying that to get them to say yes to a water main.
why would you want some other job anyway, dad?

## so you were just lying to everybody?
look, ok, i'll tell you what.

## i'll go to the meeting, all right?
lf i don't like what the man says, then i won't take the job.

## wait, this monday?
yes.

## oh, shit.
why?

## it is, isn't it?
well, it's at four, so i can, you know, make it back in time.

## what, are you stupid?
gertie, this job is very important to daddy.

## lsn't that important to you?
sorry, i didn't mean that.

## _ can the child within my heart rise above? _ can i sail through the changing ocean tides? _ can i handle the seasons of my life?
_ mm mm...

## what happened to you the other night?
you just sort of took off.

## yeah, but is that even what you know anymore?
oh, jesus.

## you too?
you want your old life back.

## so?
that's your life that you want back, not theirs.

## everybody?
oh...

## what, me?
i mean, it's not like we've got some big romance going on or anything.

## did you ever wonder if... maybe someday it might... be more than that?
for about two seconds, before you had me hiding in the shower from your kid.

## i mean, you think i'm gonna stick around here for much longer?
maya...

## neither did l.
_ my city's in ruins _ my city's in ruins

## did mommy like living in the city?
yeah, she did.

## can i help you?
yes.

## excuse me?
they love to keep you waiting.

## i think they think it gives them a psychological edge, you know?
i think they think it gives them a psychological edge, you know?

## you know anything about these guys?
i'm a publicist.

## oh, yeah, you saw it?
i haven't gotten around to it yet.

## you know what?
it's not that good.

## singing crabs?
i saw that one.

## how old is she?
she's seven.

## yeah?
cool.

## three kids?
god.

## oh, man.
how do you find time to make all those blockbusters?

## making blockbusters?
you tell me.

## what's your daughter's name?
no.

## she took you for half after she saddled the kid with the name gert?
i can't blame it on her.

## this is exactly why people don't talk to each other in waiting rooms, right?
probably.

## what's that?
understand.

## yeah, my middle one, my son?
i always pick somewhere close.

## you get to spend time with them on the set though, right?
oh, yeah.

## you out?
i'm out.

## hey, you recommend these guys?
uh... only guy i can recommend is named arthur brickman.

## you brickman?
honey, it's gonna be ok.

## come on, dad.
_ ladies and gentlemen, may i have your attention, please?

## don't you wanna live alone again?
not as much as i don't wanna die alone.

## you wanna go over there and cheer up your pop?
he's devastated about missing his big singing debut.

## may l?
uh...

## well, you showing up when you did like that?
that was just about the most romantic thing i've ever seen.

## really?
yeah.

## how was that for romance?
i'll think about it.

## can i dance with my dad now?
lf you must.

## so, no city?
no.

## we're staying here with pop?

can't i come with you?

## how about a little help here, okay?
now, look... they say these two old men got millions stashed away in cash.

## you want them to like me so they'll die and leave us their money?
we could buy a house, maybe settle down.

## but then there's lots of stories about them.
oh, wouldn't that be nice?

## just find out where they stashed all that money, okay?
maybe we should've called first.

## walter, honey, why don't you wait out here and play, okay?
i'll be a minute.

## help out?
your kid's a damn wienie.

## if my mum calls, can we hear the telephone out here?

## uncle hub?
he's sleepwalking.

africa mostly...

## what do we want any damn vegetables for anyway?
they're good for you.

## we've got better maps than that one at the house, right, hub?

## which way is north?
i'll say one thing for this kid... he sure pisses off the relatives.

## so kid, how's that root beer?
uncle hub, uncle garth, this has been such... a wonderful weekend.

## i hate to bring this up, but have you two looked at that will i left for you?

## aren't you getting ahead of the story?
okay, keep going.

## what did uncle hub do?
they got married, and lived happily ever after.

## what's going on?

## where are you going this time?
the fort worth college of court reporting.

## i'm doing everything i can to keep this family together.
can't i come with you?

## how about a little help here, okay?
now, look... they say these two old men got millions stashed away in cash.

## you want them to like me so they'll die and leave us their money?
we could buy a house, maybe settle down.

## but then there's lots of stories about them.
oh, wouldn't that be nice?

## just find out where they stashed all that money, okay?
maybe we should've called first.

## walter, honey, why don't you wait out here and play, okay?
i'll be a minute.

## help out?
your kid's a damn wienie.

## if my mom calls, can we hear the telephone out here?

why not put some of that money to work for you with the high yield only investing in gold and silver can bring?

## uncle hub?
he's slee pw alking.

## where you figure on going?
here.

## how come you're not heading to fort worth where your momma is?

## we've got better maps than that one at the house, right, hub?
yeah, a man needs a good map, that's for sure.

## which way is north?
i'll say one thing for this kid... he sure pisses off the relatives.

## so kid, how's that root beer?
uncle hub, uncle garth, this has been such... a wonderful weekend.

## i hate to bring this up, but have you two looked at that will i left for you?
you both need to be thinking about these things at your age.

## what have you got?
oh, boy.

## who'd have thought that?
kate.

## about?
the weather, actually.

## you know what it's like to be the only kid...... who got to talk about visiting day?
this move, it would be a permanent one, you understand.

## is that why you're here now?
wife of walter.

## are you serious, laura?
it's like mary poppins was here.

## where's mr. sullivan?
sorry, seth.

## what is she doing here?
looks like someone sat here, but i couldn't find any prints.

## so you think old man sullivan holed up in this chair...... and watched his wife perform?
god, i hope not.

## then he went to the door to shoot her from behind?
he also inspected her vagina.

## why?
maybe he didn't remember that he did her.

## you're in charge of the case?
yes, sir.

## positive identification?
yes...... that was my wife.

## anything else?
you'd been in barbados for two days.

## are they connected?
someone sat in it and may have been involved in the murder.

## would you listen to me whine?
i apologize, mr. frank.

## how is he?
well, he's 80 and alone, mr. president.

## who's in charge of this?
the top man.

## what happened to my rights to privacy?
i think she nicked a tendon.

## you ever been wounded?
yes, sir.

## you're serious about this press conference?
of course i am.

## shall i bring mrs. richmond home?
i don't think mrs. richmond's mission...... to help the poor in asia needs to be interrupted.

## what do we know so far?
we've checked his license plates.

## has he initiated contact?
burton doesn't think he will.

## who's gonna believe him?
after all, it's not as if he has any evidence.

## you're trying to say i have a weak face?
no, i'm saying you're lucky.

## how many passports you want?
four ought to do the trick.

## how are the rugs i made you holding up?
good.

## you leaving the country for permanent?
that could be.

## does it matter where you've been?
i hate doing asian passport stamps.

## how long is all this gonna take?
it usually takes time.

## what is it?
i never figured you for a runner.

## why do i bother to strip her and put her clothes back on?
there, i can help you out.

## why haven't they come forward?
maybe because whoever drove her home killed her.

## sorry to bother you, but the phone problems?
i took care of them.

## guess what?
no slug.

## different from the one in her body?
two different guns means two burglars.

## they both went out the window?
bullshit.

## by the way...... why did he or they go out the window anyway...... when he or they got in by breaking a zillion dollar security system?
bill burton from secret service in the parking lot.

## what's he doing in the parking lot?
bill burton.

## to what do i owe the honor?
you must be going crazy...... but the boss is interested about your progress.

## well, you know how close he and sullivan are, right?
the minute anything breaks...... i'll tell the president.

## any leads?
we're still figuring out what happened.

## you guys do that?
i was a state trooper before the government got me.

## you're that bill burton?
i was younger and dumber then.

## who is he?
it's luther whitney...... one of the great thieves of the world.

## why haven't i ever heard of him?
he hasn't been arrested in 30 years.

## his graduation picture from harvard?
that's history.

## what?
he hasn't killed anyone in 45 years.

## so what?
he's a veteran.

## pardon me?
it usually takes you guys a week to get to me.

## would you like a signed confession now or do you want coffee first?
before i send you away for life, i should probably check out your alibi.

## you been following the case?
yeah, i have.

## this person, they go in the front door...... and out a window, down a rope in the middle of the night?
now, if i could do something like that...... i'd be the star of my aarp meetings.

## what's that?
the american...

## you want me to help you solve your case?
just looking for insight.

## how would you...?
scratch that.

## what kind of person should i look for?
except for the rope trick, an older person, like me.

## because?
well, you need patience.

## what kind of research?
well, from what i saw on the tube, this is a rather large home.

## why not just steal them?
anyone can break into an office, but doing it...... without having people know you were there is the trick.

## do you realize the skill of breaking the security of a security company?
i don't know how those guys do it.

## why go to all that trouble, luther?
there's a vault in the house.

## how do you mean?
this guy obviously did the research you're talking about.

## a clicker?
well, a gizmo, like a vcr remote.

## is that funny?
i feel like you're trying to surprise me.

## would the burglar use a disguise?
yeah, he might.

## weirdo?
maybe like you.

## could you turn that off?
that is the sadness.

## who can explain chance?
if we had not met...... i would not be president today.

## see?
i don't want money.

## finished your recruiting speech?
because i'd like to know how i handle this.

## like you handled the letter opener?
gee, bill...... that could be construed as criticism.

## you want me for an enemy?
i should've called the police that night but i was weak.

## what do i do?
nothing.

## then what?
then i kill him.

## miss whitney?
thanks.

## miss whitney?
i'm seth frank.

## is that good or bad?
i don't know.

## do you expect me to walk out of here?
all right.

## yeah, when?
a few days ago.

## any idea where he went?
quit wasting my time.

## you're saying he skipped the country?
i'm saying you won't recognize him.

## where?
he never said.

## my mother loved him, all right?
even after she left him, when she was dying, he was all she talked about.

## how long has he lived here?
years.

## what if a hotshot trying to make a reputation tracks him down?
i can guarantee his safety.

## where?
open air place near my office, cafe alonzo.

## what time?
it'll be deserted then.

## okay?
thanks and talk to you soon.

## could i have some cream?
gather around, gentlemen.

## any questions?

## tums?
i got my own.

## you can call anytime.

## want me to get someone to stay here?
no, i wanna get some sleep.

## you want something for the road?
i got water and water.

## i say it wrong?
i'm tired.

## how's that?
real good.

## why'd you come?
i can't have my daughter thinking i was a murderer.

## why'd you come?
you suspected something or you wouldn't have prepared.

## why should i believe you?
because i swear to you, kate.

## can you run?
i was all set to.

## what are you gonna do?
i'll think of something.

## anything for me to sign?
no, you have an honest face.

## for...?
come again.

## would you excuse me, all?
i'm overcome with a desire to dance with my chief of staff.

## what is this nonsense?
i'm hoping there's an explanation.

## i sent a note?
yes, yes.

## you think i don't know your writing?
i assumed you wanted me to wear it tonight.

## what, alan?
christy wore it the night she was killed.

## know what this means?
no.

## you been keeping things from me?
well, it's just that you have so much on your plate.

## do we know who the forger is?
i talked to seth frank.

## how close are we to him?
we're working around the clock.

## sir?
she's a young prosecutor.

## where are you?
i won't hang around for you to trace the call.

## hello?
it's entered in the chart.

## daddy?
go to sleep, darling.

## did walter sullivan say why christy didn't go to barbados?
just that she changed her mind.

## you know who did it, don't you?
so will you.

## you're taking a shortcut, tommy?
i'm your substitute driver tonight.

## what do i call you?
luther, sir.

## and are you familiar with how to get to my townhouse, luther?
oh, yes, sir.

## what do i have to gain by being here?
i have no idea.

## you going to rob me again?
i don't need your money, mr. sullivan.

## did you check your vault lately?
i put everything back.

## you wanna know what happened or don't you?
because i was there.

## you really wanna know?
i could walk through fire.

## who else was in my house?
it was you.

## who was it, then?
you know.

## i gave him the presidency.
when you're alone and rage takes over and you want revenge...... what face do you put with your enemy?

## how the hell did he know she was sick?
you didn't tell anyone.

## is he working late?
i don't have an appointment but i want to see him.

## diane, what can you tell us?
sources tell us walter sullivan had seen president richmond tonight.

## have you no idea why the president would take his own life?
i know he's been feeling the pressure of office, more than ever, lately.

## but why would he stab himself?
that's a question that will haunt me forever.

## was that seth?
i think he'd like to come over for supper when you get well.

## am i gonna be all right?
yeah.

## that everything is so intense the colours, the taste, even the rain?
nothing like the filthy rain in london.

## he's dead, isn't he?
not guilty.

## can you identify him?
yes.

## anything to help us?
no.

the freedom to choose.

## what was that?
a grenade.

they probably think it's cheaper to let the wire services cover vietnam.

## this year?
yes.

## where, sir?
phat diem.

## which story is that, sir?
i don't know.

## can it be two years already?
yes.

## yes?

## what are you thinking?
i was wondering what she was doing right now.

you start out by being promiscuous, and end up like your grandfather faithful to one woman.

they'd fire a shot and run.

## why should they die for us?
or the french.

## what's that?
i thought i saw something move.

## what is it?
i think i've twisted my ankle.

## sit tight, ok?

## what is it, anyway?
my sister read the letter from your wife.

## i'm sorry, phuong.
how could you treat her like this?

because i wanted to keep her.

heard you came by the legation.

## who's this?
bodyguard.

## are you married yet?
no, i figured i'd wait until we got home and do it properly.

## you don't mind living here improperly?
it's hard to talk if you're going to be so cynical.

## so does this mean that we can still be friends?
i don't see why not.

## shouldn't i?
well...

## are you still in touch with general th?
we keep the channels open.

## and muoi?
mr muoi's helped get our supplies through customs.

## come to see how his explosives worked?
his original target was a military parade.

## did you tell him you wouldn't support him?
we told him if he steps out of line again...

## you knew?
i suspected that he might try something.

## you and phuong?
i never planned for any of that to happen.

## that i have no opinion?
tell me that you don't mean any of this.

## no, i do not see the big picture.
it's you, isn't it?

yes.

## ok?
that sounds great.

## what do you want?
i have something to show you.

no, she hasnt.

## ghastly weather, dont you think?
bleak, very bleak.

## its the pearl.

## black pearl?
ive heard stories.

## then where do the stories come from, i wonder?
goveror.

## what?
youre the governors daughter.

## parley what?
parley.

## well, well, well, look what we have here twigg?

## family heirloom, perhaps?
i didnt steal it if thats what you mean.

## our bargain?
still the guns and stowem,... the men.

## and where do you propose we start?
if you have any information concerning my daughter, please, share it.

## you are familiar with that ship, the black pearl?
ive heard of it.

## have you not heard the stories?
captain barbossa and his crew of miscreants sailed from the dreaded isla de muerta.

## why ask me?
because youre a pirate.

## and you want to turn pirate yourself, is that it?
never.

## hows that?
the keys run off.

## whats your name?
will turner.

## do we have an accord?
agreed.

## that ship?
commandeer.

## this girl, how far are you willing to go to save her?
id die for her.

## run out the guns.
im captain jack sparrow, savvy?

## we open fire on our own ship, sir?
id rather see her at the bottom of the ocean than in the hands of a pirate.

## is that so?
my father, will turner.

## bootstrap?
good man, good pirate.

## and thats no incentive for me to fight fair, is it?
now as long as youre just hanging there, pay attention.

## but i cant bring this ship into tortuga all by me onesies, savvy?
so...

## tortuga?
im going after the black pearl.

## well, you know better than me the tales of the black pearl?
thats why i know what barbossa is up to...... all i need is a crew.

## the kid?
that is the child of bootstrap bill turner.

## is he now?
one can only hope.

## you don t know what this is, do you?
it s a pirate medallion.

## and the blood to be repaid?
that s why there s no sense to be killing you...

## o course it does.
so this is your able bodied crew?

## satisfied?
well, you ve proved them mad.

## and what s the benefit for us?
ana maria.

## i suppose you didn t deserve that one either?
no, that one i deserved.

## with a compass that doesn't work?
aye, the compass doesn't point north...... but we're not trying to find north, are we?.

## what s in your head that s put you in such a fine mood, captain?
we re catching up.

## how is it that jack came by that compass?
not a lot known about jack sparrow before he showed up in tortuga...... with a mind to go after the treasure of the isla de muerta.

## what?
he failed to mention that.

## how did jack get off the island?
aye, sea turtles.

## what did he use for rope?
keep to the code.

## what code is gibbs to keep to if the worst should happen?
pirate s code.

## have i ever given you reason not to trust me?
do us a favor, i know it s difficult for you but please stay here.

## sorry, jack, i m not going to be your leverage.
and who among us has paid the blood sacrifice owed to the heathen gods?

## that s it?
waste not.

## i don t feel no different?
no.

## who s to blame?
every decision you ve made has led us from bad to worse.

## damned to the depths whatever man had thought of parley?
that would be the french.

## jack sparrow?
he fell behind.

## how the blazes did you get off that island?
when you marooned me on that godforsaken spit of land, you forgot one very important thing mate...

## you know whose blood we need?
i know whose blood ye need.

## what sort of a man trades a man s life for a ship?
pirate.

## why?
i don t know.

## why did you take it?
because i was afraid that you were a pirate.

## savvy?
but that still leaves us with the problem of me standing on some beach with naught... but a name and your word it's the one i need.

## funny old world, innit?
captain, we re coming up on the interceptor.

## what say you to that?
the black pearl, she s gaining on us.

## well, then can't we lose them amongst those shoals?
anything.

## ah, where s dear william?
will.

## who are you?
no one.

## anything else?
and the crew, the crew are not to be harmed.

## so i il be having that dress back before you go?
i always liked you.

## did ya not notice?
that be the same little island that we made you governor.

## were be jack s pistol?
bring it forward.

## to what point and purpose, young missy?
the black pearl is gone.

## last time... i was here a grand total of three days, alright?
last time...... the rumrunners used this island as a cache.

## wherever we want to go, we'll go.
so that s it then?

## that s what a ship is, you know?
it s not just a keel and a hull and a deck and sails that's what a ship needs...

## why is the rum gone?
one, because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into complete scoundrels.

## but why is the rum gone?
just wait, captain sparrow.

## how can you pass that up?
by remembering that i serve others, mr. sparrow, not only myself.

## are you accepting the commodore s proposal?
i am.

## do i make myself clear?
inescapably clear.

## you knew william turner?
old bootstrap bill... we knew him.

## what do you have to lose?
nothing i d lament being rid of.

## where s elizabeth?
she s safe, just like i promised.

## why don t i want to be doing it?
well, because...

## what are we doing here?
pirates come out... unprepared and unawares.

## you think he wasn t telling the truth?
just hear me out, mate.

## but what of the pearl?
name me captain.

## savvy?
i supose in exchange you want me not to kill the whelp.

## it turns out that you re a hard man to predict.
but you know, even a good decision if made for the wrong reasons...... can be a wrong decision?

## me?
i think we should decide now.

## couldn t resist, mate.
what was that?

## so what now, jack sparrow?
will it be it two immortals locked in...

## an epic battle until judgment day and trumpets sound?
or you could surrender.

## cotton s right, we ve got the pearl.
ready?

## what about jack, you re just going to leave him?
jack owes us a ship.

## there s the code to consider the code?
they re stealing our ship.

## you like pain?
try wearing a corset.

## at the moment?
no fair.

## parlay?
the ship is ours, gentlemen.

## by throwing in your lot with him?
it is.

## i think we've all arrived at a very special place, eh?
after all... he is a blacksmith.

## what happened here?
go on.

## the ceremony?
captain norringtons promotion ceremony.

## how's it coming?
it's difficult to say.

## if i may?
perfectly balanced.

## will, how many times must i ask you to call me elizabeth?

## yes?
i apologize if i seem forward but i... must speak my mind.

## will you be saving her then?
i can't swim.

## what was that?
i got her.

## where did you get that?
on your feet.

## are you alright?
i believe thanks are in order.

## pirate?
hang him.

## jack sparrow, isn't it?
it's miss swann.

## you seem somewhat familiar.
now, will you shoot him?

## have i threatened you before?
i make a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.

## do you think this wise, boy...... crossing blades with a pirate?
you threatened miss swann.

## excellent form...... but how's your footwork?
if i step here...

## you need to find yourself a girl, mate.
who makes all these?

## you're not a eunuch, are you?
come here, boy.

## what's happening?
the black pearl, she's gaining on us.

anything.

## you look nice, though.
lieutenant?

## i look nice?
i must admit, jack, i thought i had ye figured.

## me?
i'm dishonest, and a dishonest man you can always trust to be...... dishonest.

## what would you pick to eat first?
i think we should decide now.

## sorry.
what was that?

## will it be two immortals locked in... an epic battle until judgment day and trumpets sound?
or you could surrender.

## cotton's right, we've got the pearl.
ready?

## what about jack, you're just going to leave him?

yeah.

## do you think we might be on the right track?
er, yeah, well...

## do you mind if i...?
i've probably taped over it.

it's a... self preservation thing, you see.

## ooh, would we call her chubby?
i think there's a pretty sizeable arse there, yes, sir.

## i'm sure she's a lovely girl but i wonder if you could, erm... redistribute her?

## who, me?
unless you just...

## just, erm, would you excuse me for one second?
sure.

## when did you think of this?
about three years ago.

## didn't you say you learned how to live with it?
i lied.

## so now you just gotta prove it to yourself, right?
just for myself.

## how you gonna do that?
you taught me everything you know.

## you ready?
absolutely.

## wanna ring the bell?
all right.

## where'd you get that hat?
a friend gave it to me.

## who punched you in the eye?
same friend.

## i'm sorry i'm late.
oh, really?

## why don't you go and get ready to eat?
great.

## where have you been?
bring the cake in and we can get this celebration under way.

## baby, why don't you get the cake?
we got a great surprise.

## where is it?
let me set the mood.

## just be patient, would ya?
watch this.

## what the hell is this?
go on, make a wish, like he says.

## you wanna help me put out this forest fire?
sure.

## what are you doing with that cake?
the party ain't over yet, you know.

## has it been that rough?
no, no.

## do you like it?
it's beautiful.

## you know what's amazing?
that after all these years, everything still seems kinda new.

## remember that?
well, you're not.

## how long are you here for?
we talk later.

## when are you gonna fight, drago?
we talk later.

## is it definite that the soviet union will enter professional boxing?
no more talk now.

## has he boxed against a professional?
from having been trained in russia by great boxing coach manuel vega, and now by sergei rimsky, we hope he's qualified to do so.

## hope?
well, i know he is, but i don't want to sound too confident.

## you think he can fight someone as seasoned as balboa?
there is no one who can match his strength, endurance or aggressiveness.

## can this mammoth russian, nicknamed the siberian express, wreak havoc among the professional heavyweight ranks?
whoever he fights first, it'll be one hot ticket.

## dad, when can i learn to fight?
i can't hear you.

## what?
i wanna learn to fight.

## could you turn your robot down?
you see, i fight so you don't have to fight.

## no?
that's nice.

## yeah?
i'll be right there.

## hello?
yeah, apollo...

## yeah?
that's great.

## coach rimsky, what does this do to enhance performance?
well...

## has drago partaken in any experiments?
no! lvan is naturally trained.

## then how do you explain his... freakish strength?
like your popeye, he ate his spinach every day.

## shall we have a demonstration?
please do.

## and what results are those?
whatever he hits, he destroys.

## why do you wanna fight again?
yeah.

## what the hell is that?
that's my girl.

## paulie, who taught it to talk like that?
she loves me.

## either of you?
i'll... get the coffee.

## you ever try these comics?
i should've slipped that one.

## what do you think?
maybe, but... really.

## are you?
yeah.

## where do we go, stallion?
cos we sure as hell can't be born again.

## all right, but... when this is over...?
you know me, stallion.

## what made you decide to put on an exhibition fight with drago?
let's call it a sense of responsibility.

## no quick knockout predictions?
no.

## rocky, how do you think apollo should fight drago?
well, personally, i think the first thing you'd better get apollo is a ladder.

## drago, how does it feel to spar with the great former champion?
the man's tongue didn't come through customs.

## how do you mean?
in our country, apollo creed is well known and very respected.

## now you don't really think you're gonna whip me, do ya?
well, he didn't come here to lose.

## how can you be so sure?
i've been with the best.

## you are not very realistic, are you, mr creed?
you can box, yes, but you are far too old to think you can win over drago.

## why do you insult us?
a little loud for me.

## but good?
oh, yeah.

## ok?
feels great.

## try not to wear yourself out, ok?
yeah, wear myself out.

## postpone?
come on, apollo.

## then where does that leave me?
this is just some kind of exhibition fight.

## excuse me, would you?
certainly.

## think you got enough names?
be patient.

## be back in a minute, all right?
round one.

## i defeat old man.
is he ok?

## will ya let him breathe?
soon...

## creed is in a very serious condition.
where's the stretcher?

## is the man alive?
you can make it, apollo.

## rocky, is the decision final?
yes.

## is this the first time the champion has given up his crown?
i don't know about that.

## doesn't the title matter?
not until this is over.

## considering rocky's punching power, do you still expect an easy fight?
yes, of course.

## isn't it, gentlemen?
drago is the most perfectly trained athlete ever.

## champ, how much are you making for this fight?
no money.

## has the fight date been set yet?
december 25th.

## why christmas?
that's what i was told.

## where?
it's in russia.

## rocky, what's going on?
we fight in soviet union, or we fight nowhere.

## why don't you ask drago's wife why she is afraid?
yeah.

## why'd you do it?
i just gotta do what i gotta do.

## so where are you... going?
they said they were gonna let me train in russia.

## and for that you're willing to lose everything?
adrian, this ain't everything.

## even if you win, what have you won?
apollo's still gone.

## they belong to the boss.
why can't you change your thinking?

## paulie, did you pack your toothbrush?
you know how tobacco stains your teeth.

## when will you be back?
oh, pretty soon.

## are you scared?
nah.

## well, wouldn't you be?
if a big giant man wanted to beat me up, i'd be real scared.

## and will you remember one more thing?
will you remember that...

## will you?
i gotta go now.

## this is russia?
it don't look so tough, rock.

## hey, when does the sun come up?
yeah.

## why?
i just wanted to get away from things.

## they?
they are assigned to you.

## official chaperons, yes?
where you go, they go.

## ok?
this is below human standards.

## we are finished, yes?
da svidaniya.

## how the heck is he supposed to train around here?
no tv.

## what about the rose bowl game?
no room service, i bet.

## checkmate, friend.
ready to sing your song?

## yeah?
hey, champ.

## can i come up?
yeah, sure.

## no matter what?
no matter what.

## what do you think we are nerds?
listen to this crowd.

## remember what i said about wanting to be you?
forget it.

## what a tough three minutes for rocky balboa.
take it straight to him, and be a rock for me, you understand?

## you see?
he's not a machine.

## what round is it?
1 5.

## which of these magnificent fighters will be standing at the end?
drago snaps out a stiff jab.

## very, very nice.
who wants it most?

## so...... when will your buyer have the money?
he should have the money within a week.

## if i come to america with olga...... you think you can get me tickets to celine dion?
i will not only get you tickets, i will get you backstage.

## there's your guys.
and if we're really lucky, you'll have coffee with her, okay?

## how'd it go?
well, i had a minor snag.

## you got any gum?
put your thumb in there.

## so have you met the bride's family yet?
no, i'm a little worried about that.

## about what?

## what'd you want?
the mortons are bringing their children now.

## you know their 8 year old, irwin?

## daddy, you fired another caterer?
they weren't caterers.

## got any halon left?
barely.

## how about thibodoux?
you're meeting his person tonight.

## who got you into this business?
i taught you everything you know.

## was that my dad?
nope.

## hello, beautiful.
mea culpa to the tenth power... are you katherine?

## how are you?
good to see you.

## is she here?

## who's that for?
everything you've ever done, you've only ever done for yourself.

## it's personal, isn't it?
i didn't go to church enough, i didn't pray enough...... i was 5 bucks short in the collection plate.

you are going to die young...... because you smoked 30 cigarettes a day since you were 15.

do you understand that?

## that about right?
goddamn you.

## what if i told you that god and the devil made a wager...... a kind of standing bet for the souls of all mankind?
i'd tell you to stay on your meds.

## why?
who knows.

## and you think the devil is responsible?
people are evil, mr. constantine.

## what?
we should go.

wings.

## what the fuck are you talking about?
i saw you.

## aah!

## what's the plan?
i wasn't there.

## ten seconds to target.

## what do you think?

## why didn't you mention it before?
oh, my god.

## ain't that right, old man?
good.

## hello, sergeant.
just act like you're dead, okay?

## is that it?
yeah.

## hurts like a bitch, doesn't it?

## you gonna kill a cop?

## how many more people are you gonna kill tonight?

## looks that way, don't it?
well, thanks.

## for what?
you didn't call my name.

## not for a second.
sarge?

## okay?

## anybody else out there?

## do you think we have to show up at the new precinct tomorrow?

## you were like a whole different bad ass motherfucker back there, huh?
mm.

## you think so?
yeah.

## hello?
yeah.

## fun and games?
buzzkill.

## does anybody work around here anymore?
hey, sarge.

## you're a sarcastic prick, aren't you?
we still gotta pack this shit up.

## if you believe in god, mr. portnow.
how could you possibly do it wrong?

## you don't?
i never met a brother who didn't have faith.

## so what's the what?
my answer... is this.

## i was gonna let you walk outta here with the crowd for protection?
get the fuck up.

## yeah?
now is not the time.

## where is this son of a bitch?
i don't spend one night, not one night, inside, and we both know why.

## do you understand?
that guy's a cop killer.

## yeah?
friday appointment's here.

## any feelings of anxiety lately?
yeah.

## are you still taking the painkillers?
come on, doc.

## it's very flattering, but i think you should stop denying it, you know?
i hear...

## is it working?
wonderfully.

## so, uh, you got a desk job at precinct 21, i see.
what is this thing here?

## how do i feel about it?
it's no big change.

## how's your leg, by the way?
i noticed you weren't limping anymore.

## what's that supposed to mean?
it's just an observation.

## hey, you okay, jake?
everybody in the bus.

## huh?
no.

## a comic book?
you're nobody till somebody loves you

## why didn't you tell us?
i just got the word officially.

## huh?
cheers.

## to celebrate my retirement, huh?
come on.

## you mean their captain didn't want these scumbags in there?
you're like the black rasputin and whatnot.

## no problem.
got any openings, man?

## what's goin'on, dispatch?
there was an injury accident on the parkway 101.

## i'm gonna get some righteous payback from that skel for ray portnow.
well, how about this for a new year's present?

## what?
i've heard so much about this bishop guy over the years.

## how's your car?
won't move.

## so how did you enjoy your file?
oh, yeah, yeah.

## i dropped it?
that's strange, because i was sure that you took it.

## you know i stole it, all right?
and stop being so goddamn happy about it, dr. sabian.

## that's what it is, right?
if you'd read further on, you would see that's not what i think.

## what is it that you think i'm hiding from?
i'm not gonna explain myself to you if you're gonna act like a child.

## right?
yes.

## about what?
come on.

## i'm injured, all right?
that's why i'm here.

## so?
maybe you're right.

## you want a medal?
so now you're hiding behind that desk.

## my own?
yeah, your own.

## did you feel that?
all right.

## who the fuck is smiley?
for me it was i wanted this bicycle.

## i was always prayin'for it, right?
and never brought to mind

## what was that?
you heard me.

## it's only new year's...
i'll slap the smack outta you!

## i'm all right.
who the fuck are you?

## are you all right?
i know.

## why wasn't there an alarm on your back door?
that alarm hasn't worked in months.

## are you kidding me?
they must have assumed we'd call for backup.

## the frequencies are blocked?
that's not easy to do.

## i don't think so, all right?
see, this blackout, this is the kind of shit that deflates human smugness... about government's so called miraculous technologies.

## doesn't it?
this ain't no blackout, junkie.

## yeah, we're perfectly safe now.
jasper, you got those flashlights?

## these are just scare tactics, all right?
they don't know how much firepower we have or don't have.

## what are you doing this for, jake?
nobody gives a shit anymore about anything.

## are you a surgeon?
i heard that bullet you took in your belly is still lodged in there, rattling around.

## right, man?
bishop, i need to talk to you.

## why should i answer that question?
because i'm thinking about sending you out to the wolves and saving my own ass if you don't.

## how many cops are involved in this?
i can't say exactly, but the blood money runs through your entire department.

## they're here for all of us.
anyone know ifhe had any family?

## me?
all of us.

## you'd love to kill another cop today, wouldn't you?
only you.

## why are cops coming to kill us?
they need to kill him before he fingers them in court.

## iris, alex, you know how to use a firearm?
no.

## but you know something, mike?
i could live with that more than i could live with a cell mate.

## how are you keeping it together?
this is the fuckingest shit i ever seen.

## assassination politics, right?
by the government sanctioned thugs abusing their authority again, man.

## you?
i'm gonna do my best to protect you.

## all right?
all of you.

## tell me again why we should help your little skinny white ass?
no resistance.

## now you wanna turn on us?
yeah, well, thank you for that, sweet cheeks.

## you know what the problem is?
shit.

## if we can't breach, what do we do?
get the a. v. 5 here.

## are you sure about that?
yep.

## what the fuck do we do if it doesn't arrive in time?
we'll have to think of some other way of ending this.

## we got something in common, you know that?
don't be ashamed, man.

## what's your poison?
seconal to bring me down.

## what do you think, secretary?
oh, my god.

## you actually been shot five times?
six.

## you really pull a man's spine out?
it was an adam's apple.

## dig it?
and then you squeeze.

## you think i'd let you survive until the morning?
we don't have a lot of options here.

## our shit's on pause, huh?
yeah.

## why?
he's a cop.

## where are you going?
it's new year's eve.

## let's not start that again, all right?
he comes here in the guise of courting that lady.

## all right?
they shot at him.

## come on.
come on.

## do i have a fucking gun?
i can't hurt you.

## not in my precinct, all right?
i vouch for him.

## you understand?
you're not in charge anymore.

## right, bish?
he could be one of them, man, so fuckin'easily.

## fuckin'believe that shit?
comes in here playing that game, playing stupid.

## right, man?
let's do the math.

## let's put him away, man, just play it safe, you know?
put it down.

## understand?
yes.

## all right, capra?
just be cool so no one else here gets spooked.

## are you sure you vouch for this man?
i do.

## the last time in the next 15, 20 years?
all right, man.

## what do you want?
listen to me, man.

## what's the word on the a. v.?
storm's starting to let up, so it shouldn't be long now.

## i thought you never committed a crime in your life?
i haven't.

## how do we know she's not just gonna drive out of here and leave us all here to die?
shake that skinny ass in somebody else's face.

## you?
shoot.

## it's the only thing that makes sense, right?
whatever.

## what?
it's the right move, sergeant.

## i'm the doctor, right?
right.

## you can handle that?
yes.

## you can?
i don't know.

## but i have to try, okay?
no.

## now, how are we gonna get the fuck out of here?
visual on two men.

## you sure you wanna do this?

## have position but no shot.

give me one.

## you were like a whole different bad ass motherfucker back there, huh?
mm.

## you think so?
yeah.

## why not?
because i'm busy.

## what is that?
it's supposed to take us to the nearest floor.

## what's happening?
line's dead.

## what's the problem?
the doors won't open.

## what about the ones at the back?
locked as well.

## what?
it's a sealed room.

## has this happened before?
oh, my god.

## report now.
what was that?

## what?
i want your report, soldier.

## what about the cop?
matthew addison.

## who are you?
i just transferred.

## should i secure him here?
no.

## are you done yet?
it's sealed shut.

## jumpy?
lie still.

## now, how many fingers am i holding up?
three.

## what about this?
your marriage is a fake.

## and what is the hive?
show them.

## why can't i remember anything?
the hive has its own defense mechanisms... all computer controlled.

## for how long?
subjective.

## so you're saying this place was attacked?
i'm afraid things are a little more complicated than that.

## who's the red queen?
state of the art artificial intelligence.

## what happened here?
five hours ago, red queen went homicidal.

## why did she do it?
that we don't know.

## you okay?
no.

## and you?
no.

## what's taking so long?
red queen's defenses are in place.

## what is that?
that's what will shut the queen down.

## would you open that door now, please?
i'm trying.

## let's do it.
what's that?

## do what?
we have to complete the mission.

## dj vu, anyone?
keep going.

## please?
she bit me, man.

## how was she still standing?
bitch isn't standing now.

## what was all the shooting?
we found a survivor.

## and you shot him?
she was crazed.

## why not?
because blood doesn't do that till after you're dead.

## can we go now?
we're not going anywhere till the rest of the team get here.

## what the fuck are you talking about?
zero, four... zero, three, one... nine, six, five.

## whatever they are, there's too many of them out there.
got it?

## whatever they are?
it's pretty obvious what they are.

## why didn't we see them on the way in?
when you cut the power, you unlocked the doors.

## lisa?
i can help you get the virus.

## but?
but there's gonna be a price.

## who was she?
my sister.

## what kind of research?
the illegal kind.

## so how was she going to make it out of here?
she had a contact within the hive, someone i never met.

## so why didn't she make it?
maybe she trusted the wrong person.

## what, worth all this?
yeah.

## what about this door?
they're waiting out there too.

## and that way?
it's a dead end.

## what's wrong?
we don't have much time.

## you know those blast doors we passed... on the way in from the mansion?
they seal shut in just under an hour.

## what are you talking about?
they can't just bury us alive down here.

## and you're only telling us this now, when we're trapped... half a mile underground?
we have to find a way out of this room.

## where are you taking those?
i'm turning her back on.

## can you bypass it?
yeah.

## kaplan?
the initial charge must have damaged her boards.

## i did warn you, didn't i?
tell us what's going on down here.

## what about the t virus?
the t virus was a major medical breakthrough... although it clearly also possessed highly profitable military applications.

## how does it explain those things out there?
even in death, the human body still remains active.

## it brings the dead back to life?
not fully.

## which is?
the need to feed.

## how do you kill them?
severing the top of the spinal column or massive trauma to the brain... are the most effective methods.

## why did you kill everybody down here?
the t virus escaped into the air conditioning system... and an uncontrolled pattern of infection began.

## may i ask why?
insurance.

## understand?
after you.

## what the hell is this place?
the utility tunnels.

## rain?
rain.

## what?
we have to do something about your wounds.

## like the taste of that?
she was right.

## i can't.
kaplan, are you okay?

## up over my shoulder.
what are you waiting for?

## ready?
there we go.

## are you okay?
blue for the virus.

## what are you talking about?
there's a cure.

## how do you know all this?
because i was gonna steal it.

## spence?
thank you.

## spence?
we can still make it out of here.

## is that how you thought all my dreams were gonna come true?
please.

## you really believe that... people like him... will ever change anything?
nothing... ever changes.

## where is... the antivirus?
it's on the train... where you found me.

## in... or out?
i don't know what we had... but it's over.

## what the fuck is that?
one of the hive's early experiments... produced by injecting the t virus directly into living tissue.

## isn't that right?
i didn't think any of you would make it this far.

## why didn't you tell us about the antivirus?
this long after infection... there's no guarantee it would work.

## but there's a chance, right?
i don't deal in chance.

## what do you want?
one of your group is infected.

## what the fuck was that?
it's a long story.

## okay?
here.

## that way umbrella can't get get away with this.
what's going on back there?

## what is it?
you're infected, but you're gonna be okay.

## get off!.
what are you doing?

## just do it.
what's happening?

## don't show this to me.
who's in there?

## why not?
because i'm busy.

## what is that?
it's supposed to take us to the nearest floor.

## what's happening?
line's dead.

## what's the problem?
the doors won't open.

## what about the ones at the back?
locked as well.

## what?
it's a sealed room.

## has this happened before?
oh, my god.

## report now.

## dj vu, anyone?
keep going.

## please?
she bit me, man.

## how was she still standing?
bitch isn't standing now.

## what was all the shooting?
we found a survivor.

## and you shot him?
she was crazed.

## why not?
because blood doesn't do that till after you're dead.

## can we go now?
we're not going anywhere till the rest of the team get here.

## what the fuck are you talking about?
zero, four... zero, three, one... nine, six, five.

## whatever they are, there's too many of them out there.
got it?

## whatever they are?
it's pretty obvious what they are.

## why didn't we see them on the way in?
when you cut the power, you unlocked the doors.

## lisa?
i can help you get the virus.

## but?
but there's gonna be a price.

## who was she?
my sister.

## what kind of research?
the illegal kind.

## so how was she going to make it out of here?
she had a contact within the hive, someone i never met.

## so why didn't she make it?
maybe she trusted the wrong person.

## what, worth all this?
yeah.

## what about this door?
they're waiting out there too.

## and that way?
it's a dead end.

## what's wrong?
we don't have much time.

## you know those blast doors we passed... on the way in from the mansion?
they seal shut in just under an hour.

## what are you talking about?
they can't just bury us alive down here.

## and you're only telling us this now, when we're trapped... half a mile underground?
we have to find a way out of this room.

## where are you taking those?
i'm turning her back on.

## can you bypass it?
yeah.

## kaplan?
the initial charge must have damaged her boards.

## i did warn you, didn't i?
tell us what's going on down here.

## what about the t virus?
the t virus was a major medical breakthrough... although it clearly also possessed highly profitable military applications.

## how does it explain those things out there?
even in death, the human body still remains active.

## it brings the dead back to life?
not fully.

## which is?
the need to feed.

## how do you kill them?
severing the top of the spinal column or massive trauma to the brain... are the most effective methods.

## why did you kill everybody down here?
the t virus escaped into the air conditioning system... and an uncontrolled pattern of infection began.

## may i ask why?
insurance.

## understand?
after you.

## what the hell is this place?
the utility tunnels.

## rain?
rain.

## what?
we have to do something about your wounds.

## like the taste of that?
she was right.

## i can't.
kaplan, are you okay?

## up over my shoulder.
what are you waiting for?

## ready?
there we go.

## are you okay?
blue for the virus.

## what are you talking about?
there's a cure.

## how do you know all this?
because i was gonna steal it.

## spence?
thank you.

## spence?
we can still make it out of here.

## is that how you thought all my dreams were gonna come true?
please.

## you really believe that... people like him... will ever change anything?
nothing... ever changes.

## where is... the antivirus?
it's on the train... where you found me.

## in... or out?
i don't know what we had... but it's over.

## what the fuck is that?
one of the hive's early experiments... produced by injecting the t virus directly into living tissue.

## isn't that right?
i didn't think any of you would make it this far.

## why didn't you tell us about the antivirus?
this long after infection... there's no guarantee it would work.

## but there's a chance, right?
i don't deal in chance.

## what do you want?
one of your group is infected.

## what the fuck was that?
it's a long story.

## okay?
here.

## that way umbrella can't get get away with this.
what's going on back there?

september 25.

## listen, ok?
take some knowledge.

## how did we lose him?
go.

## can you switch seats with christa?
god, i would, but i got a bladder thing.

## could you trade seats so blake and i could sit together?
she asked tod, but he had some medical thing.

## please?
you're so sweet.

## you really think we'd titty fuck them over greenland?
thank you.

## hello?
ain't going that way.

## may i have your attention?
to properly fasten your seat belts... slide the flat portion into the buckle.

## could you trade seats so blake and i could sit together?
she asked tod, but he had some medical thing.

## let go, jerk.
please?

## you got this?
no one gets back on board.

## been on a lot of planes that blew up?
you fell asleep.

## i didn't cause this.
we get thrown off the plane and blow a half day in paris?

## how should i know?
you think i'm some...

## are there any survivors?
the cause for the explosion is still undetermined.

## how did you know that?
i got this feeling.

## do you take any drugs?
i saw it.

## then why'd you say it?
i didn't really think it was going to happen.

## if that's the case, alex... why did you really get off the plane?
my brother george... he told me to go keep an eye on alex.

## you said you weren't friends with those that were... so, clear, why did you get off the plane?
because i saw and i heard alex...

## why don't you stay off the j. d., then?
don't you ever fucking tell me what to do.

## the thing is, when i was done with the test... you know the guy that drives with you during the test?
anyways, he goes....

## is that true?
not now, not here, not ever, billy.

## if i ask out cynthia paster, will she say no?
fuck.

## i miss you, you know?
yeah, i miss you, too.

## where's tod?
get out of here.

## what happened?
you caused tod so much guilt over george... he took his own life.

## why would he make plans if he was going to kill himself?
mr waggner.

## why were you at tod's house last night?
i've seen enough tv to know... the fbl doesn't investigate teen suicides.

## you know what this is?
this is a...

## you can still feel it, can't you?
something from that day is still with you.

## what if tod was just the first?
of us.

## is that something that you're feeling?
i don't know.

## this place?
doing something i'm not supposed to.

## is that him?
i think.

## why did they make him up like michael jackson?
that's him.

## why'd his hand do that?
chemicals.

## what are all those tiny marks?
cuticle lacerations from pulling at the wire.

## pulling at the wire?
if he was pulling at the wire, he didn't kill himself.

## does that mean if... you figure out the design, you can cheat death?
alex, you've already done that... by walking off the plane.

## did it happen again, like on the plane?
no, it didn't, but it might as well have.

## we'll choke to death?
i want to hear you... but we'll go nuts if you start with this shit.

## the mortician said that death has a design, right?
now, what if you, me, tod, carter...

## terry, billy, mrs lewton messed up that design?
for whatever reason, i saw death's plan... and we cheated it.

## what if it still is our time?
if it is, then it's not finished... and we will die.

## when are you moving?
hi, clear.

## you want to talk to her?
clear, he's in the shower.

## can i get him to call you back?
sure.

## or to me?
dad, you and mom have both been a big help... but there's something i need to understand... before i can talk.

## i lived here my whole life, you know?
and everywhere i looked were great memories.

## what are you doing here?
i was just... checking the air in the tyre to make sure it's safe.

## next?
yeah, next, because... there's this pattern that's occurring.

## you noticed that, too?
mom's favourite.

## did you catch it in some tv static?
i never asked for what happened on the plane.

## can you promise me no one else is going to die?
no, i can't.

## what do we do?
we got nothing.

## all right, just stay still, ok?
oh, god, ms lewton.

## why?
terry should be on this wall.

## why'd you want us to meet you here?
they're watching me to see if i go to alex.

## why would i want to see him?
because he knows which one of us is next.

## drive the speed limit, ok?
and don't pass on the right.

## man, why'd you say that?
because if you say another word, i'll fucking kill you.

## somewhere... are they safe?
when i was a kid, like six or seven...

## why do you think i was hiding?
billy told the fbl he saw you running from her house.

## did you know she was going to be next before she was?
yeah, i did.

## all right, out of us... who's next to see it?
please... tell me i'm going to see the jets win a super bowl.

## it's me, right?
that's why you're not saying.

## you have a responsibility to tell me.
what are you whining about?

## think it's easier to know?
it's not.

## you get off having control over me?
let me decide how to deal with it.

## what are you doing?
i can get nailed running this next red light.

## move the car.
what are you doing?

## can't you open the door?
open the fucking door.

## are you god now?
god's not afraid to die.

## why don't you two get the fuck out of here?
rusted.

## what are you talking about?
i never moved.

## it's weird being here, huh?
we finally completed a puzzle.

## you know?
to terry.

## what?
if you would've told me six months ago... the three of us would be sitting here having a drink...

## about what?
the design.

## hear me out, all right?
oh, my god.

## but in my case, no one intervened, right?
i was thrown from that power line... by the explosion, so...

## that out of everyone on flight 180... you, me, and carter were meant to live?
maybe that was the design all along.

## can we just stop talking about this?
let's figure out...

## see?
it's true.

## clear, stay there, ok?
stay away.

## how's my suitcase working out for you?
mom, you got to leave that on.

how much for a bottle of gasoline?

## who is it?
reel him in, lad.

## cute little feller, isn't he?
you'd never believe they'd cause so much damage.

## how are the inmates?
must be getting a bit full down there.

## watching me shape?
there's a good dog.

## how is that prize melon of yours coming on?
must be a while since you measured it.

## caught red handed, eh, lad?
i'm sorry, gromit.

## how might we be of assistance?
yes.

## in an hour?
i can't wait an hour.

## hello?
that's more like it.

## don't want pests spoiling our beautiful manor house, do we?
no one's mentioned marriage, victor.

## only one thing for it, lad.
just the sort of client we should be dealing with, eh, lad?

## victor, hadn't we agreed?
the bunvac 6000.

## what the...?
oh, wallace.

## is this all of them?
just one left.

## besides, the job's only half done.
lsn't it marvelous?

## how do you intend to finish these vermin off?
they're humane.

## humane?
well, then perhaps they'd be humane enough to give me back my dignity.

## tell me, what exactly will you do with all these rabbits?
trade secret.

## it's in their little bunny natures, and you can't change that, can you?
no.

## why didn't we think of it before, lad?
the solution to all our storage problems.

## well, come on, lad, what are you waiting for?
turn on the bunvac.

## shall we?
come on.

## mrs. mulch?
please, come forward, whoever you are.

## a pest free night per... chance?
lummy day.

## where were anti pesto?
i'll tell ya.

## this was no man.
arson?

## or ears like terrible tombstones?
we live for that competition.

## who will save us?
oh, come, come, now.

## hasn't there been enough destruction?
i believe the killing of fluffy creatures is never justified.

## mr. wallace?
well...

## how could any hot blooded rabbit beast resist?
oh, come on, gromit.

## how can we possibly fail now?
you're a total knockout.

## can i call you back?
mrs. girdling.

## what do you intend to do about this?
i'll look into it.

## so where did you get to, lad?
i thought i told you to stay put.

## you do realize i've made a personal promise to lady tottington.
how are we ever gonna catch this thing if you go gallivanting off on your own all the time?

## how is this sort of behavior going to get us any nearer to finding a rabbit mon... ster?
ok, so we've created a veg ravaging rabbit monster.

## tell me, are you a vegetable lover yourself?
they're... growing on me.

## change?
oh, yes.

## totty?
i'd like to show you one last thing.

## just imagine what it would taste like.
isn't it the most sumptuous, succulent specimen you've ever seen?

## and i'm not about to let some puddle headed peasant poach her from me.
you think you can pilfer my filly, don't you?

## comprenez?
right o.

## do you want to confess?
i want to talk to you about...... the beast.

## a bullet?
a bullet.

## what kind of bullet?
a bullet of pure gold.

## this veg diet's doing the trick, eh, lad?
i feel smashing.

## so how's our rabbit monster?
hope you're keeping an eye on him.

## what's up, dog?
well, fancy that.

## because of these?
oh, no.

## cheese?
i do like a bit of gorgonzola.

## what?
the beast has struck again.

## oh, yeah?
then just take a look at my wife's brassicas.

## didn't this bit used to...?
now.

## hello?
i say.

## shoot it?
yes.

## oh, well, never mind, eh?
ta ra, then.

## part as friends?
why you...

## did it suffer?
of course not, my dear.

## victor?
oy, you.

## what?
oops.

## they don't come cheap, you know.
what the...?

## what are you doing?
wallace.

## what ever have you done to yourself?
well, don't you worry.

## pesto?
consider yourself dumped.

## wallace?
oh, gromit.

## gromit?
don't forget the crackers.

## only dentist i know who can't make money.
cheese?

## what about her father?
as a dentist, my husband was very successful.

## speaking of which, how much do you need, dear?
five should probably do it.

## look, i changed my mind, okay?
yes, i'll get you your money back.

## no drill?
no drill.

## okay?

no mayonnaise.

## excuse me?
your wife.

## so why do you torture yourself?

## what's a nice way of...?
well, she's the antichrist.

## or do you want me to name a price?
you should talk to my wife.

## what makes you say that?
life insurance.

## can you move any slower than this, fellas?
you must be our new neighbor.

## are you sure?
yeah.

## upstairs, back bedroom.
where are you from?

## you sure?
because you look like you got some gas.

## i really didn't wanna upset you.
they put mayonnaise on it?

## who's upset?
i'm just having a conversation here.

## you know who that is?
i suppose you'll tell me.

## sophie, the man's killed 1 7 people.
and that means something?

## why the stupid name?
that's his flower of choice.

## from...?

## promise?

## thank god i'm home?
i had an idea.

## your plan is you'll murder our neighbor?

## other than the fact that would make me a party to a murder?
but he's a killer.

## when?
earlier.

## do i have to answer that?
let's say...... that he did make a pass at you.

## when are you coming back?
i have to reschedule your appointments.

## are you going alone?

after he played congas on my kidneys, he took me to see janni gogolak.

## what am i gonna do?
i'll talk to you later.

## how you doing?
i don't know.

## what could be so terrible?
you've gotta get out of canada.

you want your 30 pieces of silver.

a minute ago.

look, mrs. tudeski, i don't want anybody to die.

## what do i want?
i just want this all to end.

## what would you say to a drink?
i'd say no ice, no water, in a tall glass.

## what can i say?
i was young.

## divorce him?
jimmy doesn't believe in divorce.

## assuming frankie and janni don't kill him first?
jimmy and i are over.

## what other thing?
the fact that he wants to kill me.

## why?
you're a sweet guy.

## are you rich?
the money laszlo gogolak gave us as a wedding present.

## how much was it?
ten million dollars.

## what if you told him you didn't want the money?
i did tell him.

## how much would it take for you to kill your wife?
i'm talking about you.

## what's your price?
that's what i'm saying.

## did you mean what you said?
i've got till midnight.

## what did you have, oysters for lunch?
actually, i did.

## here with me?
here in chicago.

## how did he know that?
i told him.

## you what?
he already knew.

## how?
i'm guessing my darling wife.

## is she trying to get you killed?
and when he's done with that, he'll come after you.

## don't you get it?
either way, i'm dead.

## thanks.
why?

## what the hell did you do that for?
i felt bad.

## not anymore?
it's hard to be friends with somebody who wants to kill you.

## really?
you'd be in and out.

## did you do what i told you to do?
i won't answer that.

## why don't you drive back to the hotel with me?
unless you'd rather go home in broad daylight...... with jimmy right next door.

## what's up, frankie?
welcome to montreal.

## what up, partner?
good to see you.

## doesn't he look worried?
he does.

## why don't you relax?
come on, frankie told me what a standup guy you've been.

## you're fine?
let me tell you something.

## you know your wife wants you dead?
that much i've figured out.

## the first...?
hitter.

## there were others?
at least one.

## you mean, did i take the contract?
no.

## how much she offer you?
ten grand.

## even though i went to janni?
you didn't go to janni.

## by the way, how's your urination?
fine.

## so why did you want me to go see janni?
so you could tell him where i was.

## so he'd come here, and you'd kill him?
exacto.

## do my wife?
tap her.

## whack her?
oh, see, i thought you meant, you know....

## why is that funny?
i wasn't gonna tell you this...... but the truth is, your wife came on to me.

## and...?
we're friends.

## you've been in prison for five years, and you don't find her attractive?
she's not a good person.

## you've killed 1 7 people, and you don't think my wife is a good person?
it's not important how many people i've killed.

## you gonna finish this?
just take it.

## so after you kill janni, you go back to chicago?
no, i'm done with chicago.

## you're gonna kill her too?
for a hell of a lot more than $1 0, 000.

## mr. tourette, i think we'll have to pull the tooth.
why not?

## what's the matter?
i am your friend.

## who told you?
a friend.

## anyone i know?
he's my next door neighbor.

## what's his name?
jimmy.

## can you introduce me to him?
he's a professional killer.

## what's this?
i don't know.

## what business would that be?
contract killing.

## you know her?
she's my assistant.

## you know she was a hitter?
actually, i'm still a virgin.

## excuse me?
his wife hired me.

## that was you?
to make it look like an accident, i worked for him...... to familiarize myself with his habits.

## is this the stanley posilansky incident?
anyway, laszlo doesn't want it to look like a hit.

## all right?
so i've gotta get close to stanley...... who was this really charming, cute, funny little guy.

## you know what i mean?
you got too close.

## him?
me.

## can you believe that?
go, go.

## so what did you do?
no plans.

## me and frankie figs?
wait.

## are you offering me a job?
if you're interested.

## who's the mark?
janni gogo.

## janni gogo?
i don't know.

## good news?
great news.

## why?
janni figures he'll take care of her when he takes care of me.

## are you gonna try to save her?
no.

## got a problem?
it's not like i know her.

## does this slide?
answer that.

## who was it?
they hung up.

## expecting a call?
explain how that's your business.

## you don't like the walther?
go with what you're comfortable with.

## really?
still, i like to buy american.

## is there any way i can stop you from doing this?
oz, relax.

## about 1 0 million very good reasons to kill my wife.
what is the point?

## what if i said i wasn't gonna let you do it?
you are the most chivalrous guy i've ever met.

## do you see why i couldn't kill him?
i love him.

## help?
you help.

## the gogolaks don't like to leave witnesses lying around.
this is the way it's gotta be, okay?

## are you doing it tonight?
tonight, whenever, let's go.

## for 1 0, 000?
i can live with 1 2, 500.

## honey, why don't you go get oz?
we'll run through this once more, make sure we know what we're doing.

## really?
no.

## so now what?
now we wait until...... he's asleep.

## anybody we know?
oz's wife and some guy.

## so what is he, a bad guy, your husband?
i wanna make sure we got everything right.

## what do i care?
feminine products.

## the dead part?
then ransack the house so it looks like a burglary...... and you get back in this car...... and we drive like hell back to niagara falls.

## your mother knows about this?
my mother wants this to happen as much as i do.

## what?
i had to pretend i was cahooting.

## is that janni gogolak?
from the gogolak gang.

## who's that?
i don't know.

## do you wanna use it or not?
kill him, major.

## are you guys looking for someone?
you guys are really good.

## what's going on?
oz took off with your wife, and sophie's hitter is outside.

## you know what?
better yet, stay just like that...... and in 60 seconds, stick your head out that window.

## and you just all kinds of fine, ain't you?
don't get any ideas.

## can i help you?
now you can get dressed.

## where do you want this?
put it over there.

## what was oz doing, going off with my wife?
i can beep him, you can ask him.

## now, ain't this some shit?
maybe he won't come after us and will let us go.

## we're friends now, right?
that's what harry lefkowitz thought.

## what happened to harry lefkowitz?
i don't wanna know what happened to harry lefkowitz.

## oz, what were you thinking, taking off with cynthia like that?
i'm sorry, but i can't let you kill her.

## what do you mean?
i love her.

## you love her?
you just met her.

## the one what?
i wouldn't exactly, necessarily phrase it that way exactly.

## what's he saying?
tell him to stay where he is.

## you really meant it, didn't you?
what you said.

## loving you?
of course.

## what'd you think this was about?
sex.

## was that all this has meant to you?
don't get me wrong.

## where were you guys when i did my cpa?
it's a test, sammy.

## who the fuck is dodd?

## what the fuck have you got me into?
shh.

## who is he?
calm down.

## ok?
this is my problem.

## how did you get me into this?
you offered to help me when you saw what he did to my face.

## how do i know he did that to your face?
i came straight to you after he did it.

## oh, and i just take your word?
yeah.

## hey.
did you?

## sit down, ok?
sit.

## such as?
i know what that's gonna sound like when i knock on it.

maybe it's... for when i find him.

## what happened to him?
he went to meet somebody.

## who did he go to meet?
a guy called teddy.

## what do the police think?
they don't look too hard for guys like jimmy.

## when you find this guy, this..... john g, what are you gonna do?
i'm gonna kill him.

## how am i supposed to heal if i can't..... feel time?
it's a test, sammy.

## amorous neighbors.
finished playing with yourself, lenny?

## what are you doing here?
you called me.

## should i?
wait a minute.

## is that john g?
i don't think so.

## you didn't write it down?
i might have fallen asleep before i did.

## your name?
dodd.

## who did this to you?
you did.

## why?
maybe i know her.

## he's got to have a car, right?
we take him to his car, tell him to get the fuck out of town or we're gonna kill him.

## we can't just leave him here.
how the fuck did you get him up here?

## why not?
because the maid's gonna walk in.

## why would i have a gun?
it must be his.

## which one?
we should probably steal his car.

## so was he scared?
i think it was your sinister moustache.

## what's wrong with this one?
nothing.

## so what do you do now?
i'm gonna find out what the fuck that was all about.

## who the fuck is dodd?
sammy's wife was crippled by the cost of supporting him.

## i don't feel drunk.
i did something wrong?

## hello?
housekeeping.

## well, then, call me back?
ok.

## so what am i doing?
oh, i'm chasing this guy.

## do i know this guy?
he seems to know me.

## what the fuck?
i like your car.

## what, i haven't made a strong enough impression on you?
i wouldn't be too hard on yourself.

## cut it out.
so what am i doing?

## how can you read that again?
it's good.

## please?
probably tried this before.

## will you hang on a sec?
the police report mentioned the drugs found in the car outside my house.

## honey?
honey, it's late.

## was i supposed to lock the door?
no.

## how do you know that?
oh, shit, that's true.

## well, what then?
we just go to bed.

## slam it?
yeah.

## and that's it?
that's it.

## should i wear it?
no, no, no.

## then why are you here?
try to understand, when i look at sammy, i don't see some... vegetable.

## what do you think that's like for me,..... to suspect that he might be imagining this whole problem?
that if i just could say the right thing,..... he'd snap out of it and go back to being normal.

## what do you want from me?
i want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds..... and tell me if you really believe that sammy's faking his condition.

## who the fuck are you?
unfinished business.

## whose house do you think you just walked out of?
that's right, take a look at your pictures.

## why's that?
because by now she's taken a look at the suit and the car..... and she's figuring out ways of turning the situation to her advantage.

## see these?
this is the bar where she works.

## why should i care?
because when she gets jammed up,..... she's gonna use you to protect herself.

## from who?
guys are gonna wanna know what happened to her boyfriend.

## oh, yeah?
well, maybe she'll make it you.

## you worried that she's gonna use me against you?
no.

## why not?
because she doesn't know who i am.

## why are you following me?
maybe i wanna help.

## ok, einstein?
so write this down.

## you happy now?
i won't be happy until you leave town.

## why not?
you ever wonder how long you can hang around here...

## what sort of questions?
the same questions you should be asking yourself.

## like how did you get this suit, the car?
i have money.

## from what?
you don't even know who you are.

## were you wearing designer suits when you sold insurance?
i didn't sell insurance, i investigated it.

## will you take the motel out of town?
it's been fun, lenny.

## who is this?

## did you lose your pen?
i read about your condition, leonard.

## if you have all that information, why haven't the police found him for you?
they're not looking for him.

i might've fallen asleep.

## dodd.
what's your name?

## who did this to you?
you did.

## why?

## he's gotta have a car, right?
so we take him down to his car, we tell him to get out of town or we're gonna kill him.

## we can't just leave him here.
how the fuck did you get him up here?

## why not?
the maid's gonna walk in.

## what do you think that's like for me... to suspect that he might be imagining this whole problem?
and that if just could say the right thing, he'd snap out of it and go back to being normal.

## what do you want from me?
i want you to forget the company you work for 30 seconds... and tell me if you really believe that sammy's faking his condition.

## who the fuck are you?
teddy, your buddy.

## do you even know why you're here?
unfinished business.

## what's wrong with arcamax?
the drives are very slow.

## what do you mean?
all laptops have the same design.

## going to bury it until the merger?
don't you say anything.

## does anyone else know?
i'm a grave.

## what, are you kidding, tom?
i still think, really, that arcamax will be a major, major hit.

## did you get the macadamia nuts?
good night, arthur.

## do you know a meredith johnson?
yes, years ago.

## the entire company came for this lunch?
garvin brought up the operations group.

## bad day, in laws in town?
i'm going to see lewyn about the 900s.

## are you coming to see me?
no.

## why?
nothing.

## how are you, tom?
you look all beat up.

## i do?
you're letting it get to you.

## take what personally?
maybe it's just a rumor.

## what's a rumor?
i don't want to spread rumors.

## what am i missing?
i can't believe he didn't tell you.

## so, how's susan?
susan's good.

good to see you again.

## leak?
i thought it was a rumor.

don't get paranoid.

## am i out of a job?
come on, tom.

## you want a prozac?
no, i'm fine.

## you sure?
don't worry about me.

## but he took it well?
overall, i'd say yes.

## you got that?
i have to say, going down to see him this morning was a masterstroke.

## you think she'd say to see garvin?
here's someone you should meet.

## you're john conley?
junior.

## what's wrong?
that's a hello you'd give to a rash.

## am i?
the last few years i've been cleaning up the mess bob made of this company.

## if it's such a mess, why am i so rich?
yes, but you're a lot richer now.

## really?
lit them up like a christmas tree.

## goddamn garvin.
so, what was it you wanted to see me about?

## what happened?
i didn't get it.

## he announced it?
it was a secret.

## will this affect the spin off?
she doesn't know the difference between software and a sweater.

## what aren't you telling us?
i might be out of a job.

## 271 00:15:34, 945 > 00:15:37, 664 this is the worst day of my life.
you know what it's like out there?

## nipples like pencil erasers?
she's attractive.

## sleeping with garvin?
that's why he got a nordic track.

## how do you think a clich? becomes a clich?
i have a thing for you.

## all right, please, can we get some work done?
we got a small problem with arcamax.

## how does a clich? become one?
it is very weird.

## he's not attractive?
men and women are different.

## are you saying i'm a virgin?
meanwhile, you were asking me about the spin off.

## how are you?
sorry you didn't get the promotion.

## that long?
but, bob....

## can i have the lights?
the advanced products group has been the heart of digicom for the last 10 years.

## is meredith conservative?
i don't know.

## is there anything you don't know?
freedom from the physical body.

## does it mean something?
only if she plans to make changes.

## stephanie?
nothing.

## what, all of a sudden there's stephanie lite?
she was talking about her son at the university.

## i'm jammed all day but why don't you come up at seven?
we'll have a drink and catch up on business.

## what's she want to see you at seven about?
probably the arcamax problems.

## she doesn't give you a boner?
because, you know, i definitely have lift off.

## you got a woody?
she's very nice.

## why would you want to?
live a little.

## where've you been all day?
i didn't get it.

## what can i say?
i got passed over.

## so, did you get the tickets for disneyland?
no, i know, but i promised the guy and it's...

## will you do me a favor?
alan, brown will go 250 on this, easy.

## the diagrams?
your family.

## you have pictures?
yeah, sure.

## doesn't eliza look pretty?
she looks like susan.

## what's that?
domesticity.

## remember that?
it might be a chip.

## is it all right if i leave for the day?
no.

## meredith, come on.
there, was that so bad?

## remember all the things we did?
i remember.

## doesn't that make you feel good?
don't stop me.

## what?
look, nobody has to know.

## want to get fucked?
do it.

## is that what you want?
come on.

## is that what you want?
this never happened.

## i'm going to take a shower.
you hear me?

## no kiss?
i just feel kind of shitty, you know.

## can you get me a beer?
thanks.

## before i forget, could you do me a favor?
the cellular's battery's dead.

## i thought they were supposed to last all day?
i thought so.

## what?
meredith johnson.

## she called?
yeah, about ten minutes ago.

## who is she?
she's the one, the new vp.

## she's the one?
she came from the valley.

## how old is she?
i don't know.

## had you ever heard of her?
she's a face guy.

## has she any technical background?
no.

## i deserve that, but ask yourself...... why does a man go with another girl?
he's unhappy at home.

## why are you wearing a t shirt?
you never do.

## what are you going to do?
grin and bear it, like i usually do.

## wool?
with a little bit of viscose.

## you work out?
when i get a chance, bob.

## where is everyone?
they left 15 minutes ago.

## nobody told you?
hey, i know you.

## what's the angel saying?
that's between them.

## what's that?
i believe it's your financial records.

## did the ferry hit an iceberg?
you were going to call me after meeting meredith.

## hey, pal, i left a message on your machine, all right?
check it out.

## did you get my message?
you told susan the meeting had been moved to 8:30.

## how many of the drives meet specs?
i don't have that information with me.

## is that approximately right?
the seek times are off specs.

## right?
that's right.

## with the merger impending, shouldn't you have told someone?
the merger isn't about a cd rom that might be obsolete in a year.

## it'll be obsolete in a year?
the promise of the arcamax...... was a central factor in this merger.

## nine months?
meredith said six weeks.

## is there a problem?
this isn't an inquisition.

## sit down.
and the bottom line is...... you don't know?

## what'd i do?
please, would you just sit.

## what'd she say?
she wants to handle the intervention internally, which is best.

## what'd she say?
not to put too fine a point on it, she said you sexually harassed her.

## what would you call it?
she jumped me.

## she jumped you?
looks like she defended herself.

## i've never heard of a woman harassing a man.
defended herself?

## why're you here?
i'm here as your friend.

## want your wife to find out?
720 00:44:24, 745 > 00:44:26, 656 we'll have to tell her at some point.

## austin?
i told him what she said.

## he denies it?
you know, the man always denies it.

## is he crazy?
i offered him a move to austin.

## you got that?
i get the picture, bob.

## there were no witnesses?
her assistant left earlier in the night.

## did you report that to anyone?
in the morning, yeah.

## what was the company's response?
they believed her.

## the point is, if i go to austin, i lose everything, all right?
my stock options, everything that i worked for.

## did you call anyone after the incident?
no.

## did you tell your wife?
oh, boy.

## why not?
i didn't want to upset her.

## how would you characterize miss johnson physically?
she's very pretty.

## rub you where?
you know....

## your penis?
yes.

## and?
i'm uncomfortable talking about it.

## because i'm a woman?
you act like it's a game.

## why are you here?
i want to know what my options are.

## what your options are?
i want to know whether i can sue her for sexual harassment.

## do you not think it's a game, mr. sanders?
it's a game to them.

## how do you feel about losing?
793 00:49:56, 025 > 00:49:57, 617 that's what meredith wants.

## why?
she's accused me.

## why not press charges?
meredith didn't press charges...... because she couldn't.

## are you willing to play it?
fuck them.

## who the hell is he to sue me?
sexual harassment, under title seven.

## mediate?
i want you to cut his balls off.

## did he say mediate or split the difference?
i'm just hoping he'll agree.

## really?
he hasn't told his wife yet.

## i know sanders, remember?
he likes secrets.

## where were you?
they're pulling the drives apart.

## john levin with sematach?
he said it's important.

## why didn't they come this morning?
susan called about the benefit.

## is everything okay?
all he does anymore is give macadamia nuts to people.

## what's slowing it down?
over here.

## is it a bug?
don cherry debugged arcamax.

## what're you doing?
this is a sophisticated piece of electronics, not a pickup truck.

## how bad is it?
we have 4, 000 of these.

## should i junk them all?
i told arthur to send ten in heat sealed plastic bags.

## how are you?
let's agree to mediate.

## guess what?
they locked me out of my computer and cleaned out my files.

## i'm not interrupting?
no, not at all.

## going down?
don't tell me you're scared of me.

## which is more stigmatizing?
yeah, barbie's stigmatized.

## she was once a man?
just tell her.

## tell her what?
tell her a lot of us have worked as hard as you...... and you're blowing this merger for all of us because you fucked up.

## who got to you?
it's not that simple.

## who knows?
an old girlfriend, a bottle of wine, a late meeting...

## could you possibly be more lame?
for your information, mark, tom told me everything.

## did you have sex?
and that was it.

## her hand was in your pants?
nothing happened.

## you don't believe me?
mark doesn't believe you.

## how could you let this happen?
nothing happened.

## what does she look like?
she's attractive.

## what does the company say?
they want me to transfer to austin, do some therapy.

## austin?
i'm not moving there.

## for what?
sexual harassment.

## when were you going to tell me?
that's brilliant.

## are you crazy?
they'll destroy you.

## do you have a lawyer?
catherine alvarez.

## you know how many times it's happened to me?
you never said this ever happened you're so narcissistic.

## why don't i just admit it?
they call me a rapist and i apologize.

## when?
good morning, i'm judge murphy.

## any questions?
let's get started.

## then she approached you?
correct.

## where?
she kissed me in my ear...... on my neck...... on my mouth.

## when you asked her to stop, did she?
no, no.

## were you aroused?
yes.

## did you climax?
i grabbed her by the wrists.

## then what did ms. johnson do?
she threatened me.

## mr. sanders, would you like a break?
no, i'm fine.

## you say the bottle of wine was ms. johnson's idea?
yes.

## but when you were living with ms. johnson...... didn't you discover wines together on trips to the napa valley?
yes.

## romantic trips?
yes.

## did you have a conversation after lunch about how...... seeing meredith gave you a...... boner?
someone else said that.

## a boner?
yes, but i didn't say it.

## if it's harmless...... why are we here today?
well, it was just...... what guys talk about.

## about their boners?
not generally, no.

## yet you expect us to believe that after having a sexual conversation...... you weren't thinking of sex?
that's correct.

## highly sexual?
i don't know how to rate it.

## every day?
sometimes twice a day.

## she was just your boss now?
that's correct.

## and do you admit having an erection during your meeting?
she had her top open.

## do you think her gynecologist gets an erection when he examines her breast?
that's completely different.

## do you admit putting your penis in her mouth?
she did.

## did you tell your wife about your seven o'clock meeting with ms. johnson?
i had a meeting and i'd be home late.

## you expected to be late?
no, but if i got home earlier my wife would be pleasantly surprised.

## so you make it a rule to lie to your wife?
i didn't lie.

## when you got home, did you tell her what happened?
no, i hoped it would go away.

## you hoped you'd get away with it?
do not debunk the illusion that this dispute might be settled amicably.

## do you have those pictures now?
i'd like copies for my file.

## and where was mr. sanders at that point?
he began to rub my shoulders.

## and you let him?
it was awkward...... but i thought we'd end the meeting and leave it at that.

## then he tried to kiss you?
no, mr. garvin called and then i came back to tom...... and said that was it, and then he began to kiss me.

## did you try to stop him?
yes.

## did he attack you physically?
yes.

## he put his...... penis in your mouth?
this is making me uncomfortable.

## want some water?
thank you.

## were those his words?
and then he reached down and tore off my panties.

## what did you do then?
he threw me down on the scaffold and i kneed him in the groin.

## and that was the end of it?
it's strange.

## how did he react?
he seemed to realize what he'd done.

## did you call anyone afterwards?
no.

## you reported it the next day?
yes.

## why not?
i talked to phil blackburn.

## mr. sanders suggested the bottle of wine?
that's right.

## did you tell her what kind?
i said to get a nice chardonnay.

## do you remember the wine?
no.

## do you know where your assistant got that wine?
i assume she got it at a liquor store.

## would it surprise you to know...... that no liquor store in seattle carries that bottle?
mrs. ross is very resourceful.

## very resourceful?
a bottle of wine you can't find within 500 miles of seattle.

## what was that?
it had such managerial brio.

## do you have testimony from mrs. ross?
yes, i do.

## ms. johnson?
the fact is mrs. ross has personal problems.

## any more questions?
no, not for now.

## she's trying to quit smoking?
it's true.

## how could you do this?
she did it.

## so what?
yeah, but no one will talk and we can't subpoena them just for a mediation.

## do you want to have lunch?
i must go back to work.

## are you married?
chandler, hogue and alvarez.

## you married your boss?
classic case of sexual harassment.

## what do you think?
i don't look good in hats.

## hardly makes it better, does it?
i can't get in the middle of your relationship with tom...... but she did break the law and that makes the difference.

## when did these arrive?
came in an hour ago.

## it's at the hotel?
yeah.

## getting anywhere with the drives?
i'm counting on you.

## what is it?
i don't know.

## what is it?
i don't know.

## what else?
they're stronger, they're smarter and they don't fight fair.

## what do you have?
if i know something for a fact, i won't withhold it.

## why aren't you at the mediation?
i just came back to....

## a friend?
all right, never mind.

## heading back to the mediation?
yeah, i must get back.

## don't you think it's time we talked?
i understand you both had a chance to get it off your chest.

## how many sides are there?
all right, let's say she made a mistake.

## so what?
she made a pass, that's all.

## maybe i should have.
after all these years, why didn't you come to me?

## i mean, why can't you just forget it?
work together like adults and everyone makes a pile of money.

## what's wrong with that?
it's gone too far.

## why would he offer to settle now?
he realized how much they got to lose.

## remember the cleaning lady?
she's out of town.

## did mr. sanders ever touch you in a way that makes you feel uncomfortable?
he's not aware of it.

## how?
he'll pat me on my behind or...... rub my shoulders.

## rub your shoulders?
i don't think he means anything by it.

## any neck problems, or your back?
no.

## so you would characterize this behavior as flirting...... or sexual?
1352 01:22:13, 465 > 01:22:16, 059 i suppose so.

## you didn't report it?
he's your boss.

## and if i ask you if you ever had any sexual relations with mr. sanders...... same answer?
no, i didn't.

## didn't report it?
it never happened.

## ... about the disneyland tickets for...?
jafar.

## i'll see you later?
yes, i'll see you later.

## isn't that funny?
that's not true.

## really?
hunter, not someone you'd follow into battle.

## what, you on meredith's side?
i studied engineering for eight years.

## you know what i did?
i worked.

## 1387 01:24:31, 585 > 01:24:32, 540 what?
their offer ends midnight.

## did we get the address?
dr. arthur friend, a chemistry professor from the university of washington...... who's been in nepal the last three weeks.

## what?
mark's wife's voice is on the machine, but on monday it was a man's voice.

## so?
that's why the battery was dead.

## what are you talking about?
that's why garvin wants to deal.

## what's going on?
i've been getting phone calls.

## have they got the tape?
what i'm saying is, it's good i brought it home.

## do you have any idea what this means?
this never happened.

## is she threatening?
i don't know how many copies of this tape there are.

## ms. johnson, is that your position today?
yes, it is.

## ms. alvarez?
sex where both parties are willing participants.

## do men deserve less?
when he really wanted to stop he had no problems doing it.

## the only thing you have proven is that a woman in power...... can be every bit as abusive as a man.
until the moment of penetration

## you want to put me on trial?
let's be honest about why.

## what did phil say?
you get your job back.

## meredith?
she stays through the merger, then they say...... she has to leave for some whatever emergency.

## he has no idea, does he?
i'd like to read this over again before we sign.

## right?
you don't want to know what i think.

## what?
i hope you still think of me as a friend.

## where will you be?
here, working on the presentation.

## why'd she do this?
you've seen her in action.

## how'd she lose control like this?
i don't know.

## where is everyone?
mr. garvin came in an hour ago.

## what if sanders doesn't bring it up?
he will.

## has my contract gone out already?
shit.

## for incompetence?
the problem with the drives is not with the programming or the design.

## my room number?
it's on the phone here somewhere....

## when does your dad arrive?
midnight.

## why don't we go up to my suite?
give my colleagues a chance to try out the corridor.

## can i stop files from being deleted?
i'm sorry.

## telephone or video?
video.

## who'll believe him?
he's married, with a family.

## then we say sanders made the changes at the plant?
he'll deny it.

## who's first?
must have left the system on.

## are you sure there's not another system somewhere?
the system has been completely deleted.

## susan got the disneyland tickets for you.
how are you?

## the e tickets?
mohammed, on this end, we back up our files on dat.

## do you do the same over there?
i don't know what we have.

## why?
i got a real problem here.

## daddy?
i never believed what they said about you.

## those from malaysia?
i can't believe it's still coming out.

## tom, can you come up here...... and review for us the revolutionary new product we call arcamax?
thank you, meredith.

## and were the problems with the design?
no, there are fabrication problems involving the production line.

## what sort of problems?
for example, we should be using automatic chip installers to lock...... the control chip on.

## you didn't anticipate these problems?
the line was changed.

## how is that possible?
we know you to be a competent manager.

## we're buying this company because they build things.
you haven't?

## you understand what she means?
i'm trying to convey the sentiments of everyone here.

## can you build the darn thing or not?
yes, sir, we can.

## ten minutes?
i'm surprised you didn't come to gloat.

## did it ever occur to you, meredith, that maybe i set you up?
this is my son, spencer.

## how you doing?
good.

## you're at the university of washington?
that's great.

## the question now is...... who do we find to run things up here in seattle?
and that person...... is stephanie kaplan.

## you a chemistry major, spencer?
yeah, i am.

## save something for your wife.
you just figured that out?

## are you kidding?
alcohol revives me.

## what year are you in?

## are you a reporter?
no.

## isn't that deceiving the public?
our readers... want to see scary photos.

## does that mean every photo is fake?
i didn't say that.

## see anything?
this is the first photo i had.

## without a message to convey?
most importantly...

## can you fake them?
you load the film and press the shutter.

## how do we know what they want?
perhaps... the answer is in the photo.

## step on it again.

## been working hard lately?
not really.

## you're in love with this slut?
i am not a slut.

## why can't you just admit that when you kissed me, you liked it?
you're right.

## when are you gonna get hitched?
actually, i'm not.

## really?
by the power vested in me by the state of washington...... i now pronounce you man and wife.

## and you know what?
i'm wiiiing to bet some hard earned cash on it.

## how much are you proposing?
quiet down, rex.

## what's going on?
i got this weird pulse coming in on my frequencies.

## you, too?
it's weird.

## what do you think it is?
i think it's the pinkos doing something with our radios.

## what the heck's the matter with you, boy?
could be a rock or some sort of fossil.

## how deep in the ice is it?
four, maybe five meters.

## what do we do about it?
i talked to the nasa research station at rundell peak.

## why?
i don't know.

## did he sound like there was a problem?
come in.

## john, about the student, right?
i've been meaning to talk to you about her.

## no, look, do you know who alexie gierach is?
stanford genetics.

## why?
well, station telemetry identified some sort of radio signal...

## really?
they burned a spectrogram of it on this cd.

## plain or with cheese?
i don't care.

## what have you got?
look at that.

## nonrandom?
definitely.

## what about a meteorite?
a meteorite as big as this would've left a mile wide crater in the ice shelf.

## you said it was nonrandom?
yes, with a fixed pulse device.

## you mean some sort of new search signal?
i don't know.

## why not?
from a radio tech at the falklands.

## where is it originating from?
antarctic.

## moved?
that's what they said.

## what can be boosting it?
haven't a fucking clue.

## they did?
yes, indefinitely.

## sure?
hold on, let me take this.

## what's your name again?
nyla.

## how far underground are we, nyla?
about 20 meters.

## what the hell is that?
it's a glacier shift.

## it's safe, right?
yes, it's fine.

## so, nyla, right?
right.

## what do you do here?
i came with michael...

## what position is that?
dr. brecher warned us about you.

## you're not talking about kate brecher, are you?
dr. brecher.

## what do you think is inside it?
my first guess would have been... a shale slag caught in a glacier.

## could it be the work of setl?
there is no more setl.

## what did nasa say when you told them about this?
i haven't.

## why not?
our work here is in a very sensitive stage... and we both know how paranoid nasa can get.

## you okay?
yeah.

## too old?
maybe a little.

## what happened to what's his name, speaking of types?
it ended.

## what makes you think i'm going to screw it up?
experience.

## hello?
i'm just checking to see if you want breakfast.

## what time is it?
a little after 10:00.

## are you going to do some calisthenics?
it just makes it easier... because of the antibacterial showers when i'm working in the fields.

## how big is it?
3. 2 acres.

## you're finally up and about?
this is some place.

## who's your friend?
dr. michael straub.

## strubb?
straub.

## what are we gonna talk about?
i don't want to talk about anything.

## do you have any idea what we're doing?
you're wearing bathing suits and growing corn.

## everything's always a joke with you, isn't it?
we've made a breakthrough in genetics that'll put us in the running for a nobel.

## how did you squeeze this kind of money out of nasa?
they're obsessed with selling congress on planetary colonization.

## what do you really think is in that block of ice?
i'm sorry for what i said.

## what do we know about this juiian rome?
37 years old.

## what's the connection between gierach and rome?
gierach actuaiiy contacted dr. bachman that i toid you about.

## what's that?
the student he had the affair with, her name is katherine brecher.

## how'd you read it?
when the weather's good we use a landsat satellite.

## yeah, how'd you know?
that's where we always kind of expected it would be.

## so you really think it's artificial?
i know it's artificial.

## there?
great.

## who haven't you met yet?
i haven't met anybody.

## you're still here?
yeah, for a while.

## what exactly do you do?
it's like an interpreter.

## interpreting what?
messages from outer space, my dear.

## just exactly how many signals have you interpreted?
none, exactly.

## do you believe in god?
yes.

## have you ever heard from him?
no.

## how about a drink?
think i'm gonna turn in.

## how iong do these communication biackouts iast?
seen it go a couple of weeks before.

## till then we're totally cut off?
when it gets like this, nothing can get in or out.

## am i crazy, or does this thing seem to be giving off a low grade impulse?
i can feel it in my joints.

## was the signal harmonic when you first intercepted it?
no.

## what does that mean?
two or more separate frequencies combined in one signal.

## hard line here?
if i can't communicate with the satellite, i'll have to intercept the signal here.

## what are you gonna do?
try and find out what's buried in the harmonic.

## how?
mathematics.

## any luck?
no.

## what's your brother do?
he's dead.

## you guys train together?
yeah.

## think i ought to wake her?
no, let her sleep.

## what happened to the sound?
nothing.

## why?
what mr. rome is going to hear is best heard from somebody he trusts.

## what's the matter?
abell woke us up.

## what happened?
i've never seen anything like this before.

## what is it?
don't touch it.

## you okay?
it's got some sort of electrical charge to it.

## what the hell are you talking about?
i'm talking about this.

## that's a message?
it's part of a message.

## could there be more to the message that's not being deciphered?
there could be several cryptographic keys.

## alexie, what do you think?
i agree with julian.

## can we open it?
if you can discharge it, i can pry it open.

## you believe it's eti in origin, don't you?
everything certainly points to it.

## why do you hope i'm wrong?
because if you're right, we could be neanderthals in comparison.

## am i interrupting something?
no.

## was i interrupting something?
it's a long story.

## will you do me a favor?
i wanna...

## will you watch this program?
i wanna grab a shower, get something to eat.

## would you like some company?
that would be nice.

## is this gonna work?
it should.

## some water, coffee?
brandy.

## what if we're already too late?
we've considered that.

## what do you think is inside it?
nothing, i hope.

## what if he's right?
snap out of it, kate.

## water exposure?
it appears more like a molten degeneration... from exposure to extreme heat.

## anything?
no, it just keeps returning to that.

## what exactly is it doing?
trying to speak.

## but with a different language?
yeah.

## like what?
it's a computer game... where you have to figure out the math puzzles.

## what?
maybe each piece of the message is its own key.

## what do you mean?
mindmaze.

## what do you think, abell?
i think i'm getting there.

## what could be in it?
i've got the fire under control.

## is anybody hurt?
i'm okay.

## how about yourself?
i'm all right.

## anybody down there?
i'm okay.

## what about jack?
i don't know.

## where are some flashlights?
i'll show you.

## is anybody else hurt?
i've got a few scratches.

## where's the kid?
last time i saw him, he was on the stairs.

## pinter, you okay?
let's get down there and see what happened.

## is everybody accounted for?
i don't know.

## you all right?
yeah.

## you okay?
yeah, i'm fine.

## what is it?
i've never seen technology like this.

## what're you gonna do?
i want to see what it is.

## what's it doing?
oh, my god.

## what the hell is going on down here?
we're going down in history.

## you think it's dead?
looks dead to me.

## what the hell is going on?
must be airborne.

## without prejudice?
but we hold until we make contact.

## viral?
i think the infection is protozoan.

## chances are we've all been infected, right?
maybe not.

## that's possible, isn't it?
so is genetic flexibility.

## what the hell's she talking about?
sometimes a disease will slow down its infection rate... so it doesn't kill the thing it needs to live on.

## you mean if we're all dead, it'll die, too?
around 24 hours.

## what area uses the most energy?
the field labs.

## what?
the thing, it's gone.

## where is it?
it must still be somewhere in the bay.

## what do we do?
we find it.

## are there any firearms here?
the pilots have two 9 millimeters in their gear.

## why don't we split up?
this is just great.

## what?
jeez.

## just don't sneak up on me like that, okay?
let's go to the machine room and check the generators.

## the question is... what will it do with us?
i think it's these three.

## you see?
i'm not gonna hurt you.

## rundeii peak, do you read?
over.

## this is about the alien, isn't it?
my god, it's true.

## how many fataiities?
two by accident, four by infection.

## has the environment outside the station been compromised?
no one's been outside.

## john, are you still there?
what you found in the ice was an escape pod... simiiar to our own aircraft ejection system.

## is it some form of telepathy?
yes.

## is it stiii aiive?
it's dead.

## what do you mean, sterilization?
it's been decided.

## how the hell can they help us?
they're not coming here to help us.

## how iong do we have?
lf we were, we would be dead.

## what about running blood panels on us to verify it?
protozoa is known to disguise itself in cellular protein.

## could we be resistant?
possibly.

## why don't you go help her get set up in the med lab?
i don't fucking believe it.

## are you sure?
look for yourself.

## what are the odds?
99. 999 to the infinite.

## for christ's sake, what are we waiting for?
i say we get out of here now.

## what do you think, alexie?
without absolute proof it would be incredibly irresponsible.

## what do you think?
lf there's no sign of it, i agree with you.

## do you want to die for nothing?
no, i don't.

## are you out of your mind?
there's no sign of it in our blood.

## what more fucking proof do you need?
i'm not going anywhere with you.

## why?
because only you can fly the plane.

## yeah, why?
i think we should reprogram the codes in case someone decides to try and leave.

## how long till we reach launch coordinates?
eighteen minutes, captain.

## are you okay, michael?
no.

## how long since we spoke to bachman?
over an hour.

## so now we wait?
now we wait.

## what's he talking about?
the cornfields.

## help me, julian.
who's gonna fly the plane?

## what's happening?
help me.

## go where?
we're out of time, we got to go.

## you all right?
we'll use the maintenance bay door.

## where's michael?
he's dead.

## what do we do now?
they want us to go with them.

## this cabinet minister... does he always travel on the wrong side of the border?
apparently they strayed off course... and we're fairly certain they're in guerrilla hands.

## what do you need us for?
make it easy on yourself, dutch.

## what's this fucking tie business?
come on.

## why'd you pass on libya?
that wasn't my style.

## why did you pass?
we're a rescue team... not assassins.

## now, what do we got to do?
the cabinet minister's important to our scope of operations... in this part of the world.

## who's our backup?
this is a one way ticket.

## this stuff will make you a damn sexual tyrannosaurus... just like me.

same business.

## do you remember afghanistan?
trying to forget it.

## what the hell were they doing here?
i don't know, dutch.

## why did they skin them?

nobody else could've done it.

## pissed about the cover story?
i needed it to get you in here.

## what story did you hand hopper?
look, we've been looking for this place for months.

## what happened to you, dillon?
you used to be somebody i could trust.

## why don't you?
you're an asset... an expendable asset... and i used you to get the job done.

## got it?
my men are not expendable.

## how much time?
half hour, maybe less.

## you wanna make that call or should l?

major, you better take a look at this.

there's no sign of it.

## quien fue?

## you saw what?
i saw it.

## what the hell could have done this to a man?
i don't know, goddamn it.

## what was that?
those eyes, they... they disappeared.

## mac, you take first watch... then you get some rest, ok?
ask her what she saw.

## qu fue lo que viste?
te dijo lo que s.

## qu ms quiere que te diga?
same fucking thing.

## what is it?
i'm scared, poncho.

## still don't understand, dillon, do you?
whatever it is out there, it killed hopper... and now it wants us.

## real number ten night, remember?
whole platoon... 32 men chopped into meat... and we walk out, just you and me.

## mac, where are you?
jesus.

## think you could have found something bigger?
fuck you, poncho.

## why didn't she try to get away?
look at her.

## why didn't he try and kill one of us?
he came to get the body.

## yesterday, what did you see?
you're wasting your time.

## blain and hawkins were killed by a lizard?
anna.

## what the hell are you doing?
we'll need everyone.

## you think the chopper's going to wait?
we make a stand now, or nobody will be left.

## you really think this boy scout bullshit's gonna work?
it can see tripwires.

## what makes you think he'll come through here?
the trees have tripwires every 50 yards.

## what you gonna try next, cheese?
hey, dutch.

## mac?

## can you tell our viewers the moment you decided to change your life?
i left my job at big lots and thought about becoming an alcoholic.

## can we get a shot of that?
motivational speaker.

## why'd you pick flying?
no matter how much i love that sleepy little town, none of my dreams were waiting down there.

## but how?
you should start by buying my book.

## donna, why do you want to be a stewardess?
well, for all the travel opportunities.

## you nervous?
don't worry about him.

## you nervous, donna?
nah.

## okay?

my whole life was over before it had begun.

## what was the bathroom like?
awful.

## are those new earrings?
the guy in rome.

## what?
we are as good as they are.

## we are?
we don't have to spend our lives working at sierra for some weaselly ex bookie.

## what happened?
they went bust.

i needed a job.

## i scared you, didn't l?

i didn't notice.

## are you kidding me?
they would have never picked you unless they thought you could handle it.

## your aunt?
she's kind of like a friend.

## why not?
i can be happy for you that you're leaving for an hour.

## yeah, our timing is kind of terrible, huh?
i had a really good time, and i was hoping you'd be a jerk so i wouldn't feel like i was missing out by moving to texas.

## the whole thing?

## how did you all meet?
sally, please.

## so, is it difficult to get those international routes?
you have to have seniority.

## should i apply now?

## this is all yours?
you bet.

## what do you mean?
i sense something in you, donna.

## what is it?
hunger.

## you do?
mm hmm.

## and luxurious?
paris.

## yes?
this is first class.

## no.
you call these warm nuts?

you told me to take it.

## what are you doing in cleveland?
i live here.

## it's unbelievable, huh?
so i've got one year in cleveland.

## so, why'd you go back to law school?
i had dinner with this incredible woman who was charging after her dreams and not hiding out.

## a real business class?
and guess what i get to do in half an hour.

## you think so, huh?
mm hmm.

## how is it that you believe in me so much?
somebody's got to.

## isn't he cute?
aside from the headphone hair.

## and that's bad news why?
for me, anything that ever has to do with family is always bad news.

## i just worry that if i fall in love with ted, what's gonna happen to everything i've worked so hard for?
okay.

## you didn't fall in love with me, did you?
you're gay.

## but it still took willpower, didn't it?
thanks, donna.

## it's from me and ted.
who's next?

## thank you, dear.
what?

## oh, my god.

## you like it?
it's so beautiful.

## i'm just not used to all that, you know?
dan.

## how's life treating you?
all right.

## any chance of that dallas route opening up?
let me have a look.

## what are you doing in cleveland?
my new york l. a. flight had mechanical problems, so they dumped us here for the night.

## i was thinking about how well you trained me.
you know what, ted?

## i was on the new york to chicago flight, right?
this guy gets on.

## that's not what i would do.
so i politely said to him,

## what do you mean?
well, you must, as a flight attendant, offer the option of buying another seat at half price for that oversized item.

## say, christine, do you have any of those little wings?
my nephew's been begging me for some.

## want to?
paris.

## who says there is nothing i can do?
i am sally weston.

## what is it, donna?
this isn't my test.

## so, how'd you do?
new york, here i come.

## how soon can you leave cleveland?
i'd just have to talk to ted.

## who's ted?
this really great guy that i'm seeing.

## well, what would you do?
well, i know what i did.

## yeah?
i have to ask you to come with me.

## who are you?
royalty security.

## when are they doing that?
i got to leave right away.

## we don't talk about it?
i come home.

## you're leaving?
well, we've always said that cleveland is just a big waiting room.

## i am?
yes.

## what?
i got fired.

## you haven't found her?
no.

## right?
yes.

## mightn't he do something to her?
just leave that to us.

## could he cover up by marrying her?
he has a wife and three children in england.

i haven't the faintest idea.

thank you.

## hello, effie?
it's me.

## what do you want here?
i'm sam spade.

## english, ain't it?
a webley forsby. 45 automatic, 8 shot.

## how many gone out of it?
just one.

## shot up here, huh?
standing like you, with his back to the fence.

## who found him?
man on the beat.

## anybody hear the shot?
somebody must've.

## you want to look at him before we take him away?
no, you've seen everything i could.

## well?
he was tailing a guy named thursby.

## what for?
we wanted to find out where he lived.

## any forwarding address?
thanks.

## how'd she take it?
i don't know anything about women.

## what kind of gun do you carry?
none.

## you sure about that?
look around.

## how can we turn up anything if you don't tell us what you got?
tom says you were in too much of a hurry to stop and look at your dead partner.

## what time did you get home?
a few minutes ago.

## where'd you walk?
bush street.

## thursby die?
yep.

## how'd i kill him?
i forget.

## hotel people know anything?
just that he lived there a week.

## alone?
yeah, alone.

## well, did you?
we thought you could tell us that.

## effie take care of everything?
i think so.

## who put that bright idea in your head?
well, i thought you said if it wasn't for miles, you'd....

## you'll come soon?
soon as i can.

## well...... how did you and the widow make out?
she thinks i shot miles.

## so you could marry her?
the cops think i killed thursby...... the guy miles was tailing for that wonderly dame.

## are you going to marry iva?
don't be silly.

## do you suppose she could have killed him?
you're an angel.

## oh, am i?
thanks, honey.

## are you telling me?
she kept me waiting at the door as she undressed.

## do they?
look at me, sam.

## where?
coronet apartments, california avenue, apartment 1001.

## what's the name?
miss leblanc.

## what is your name, wonderly or leblanc?
it's o'shaughnessy.

## tell me, mr. spade, am i to blame for last night?
you warned us that thursby was dangerous.

## was he married?
yeah, with $10, 000 insurance, no children, and a wife that didn't like him.

## mr. spade, do they know about me?
not yet.

## can't you shield me so i won't have to answer their questions?
maybe, but i gotta know what it's all about.

## why did you want him shadowed?
to find out how far he'd gone, whom he'd met, things like that.

## did he kill archer?
certainly.

## did you?
no.

## why all the guns?
he lived by them.

## how bad a spot are you actually in?
bad as could be.

## physical danger?
i'm not heroic.

## then, it's that?
it's that, as surely as we're sitting here.

## who killed thursby, your enemies or his?
i don't know.

## will you go to the police?
i just got to stand still, and they'll be all over me.

## how much money have you got?
i've got about $500 left.

## can't you get some more?
no.

## you got anything you can raise money on?
i've got some furs and a little jewelry.

## did you send the flowers?
you're invaluable, darling.

## hello, sid?
i think i'm going to have to tell a coroner to go to blazes, sid.

## can i hide behind the sanctity of my client's identity...... secrets and whatnots all the same, priest or lawyer?
but dundy's getting a little rambunctious, and maybe it is a bit thick this time.

## what'll it cost to be on the safe side?
thank you, sir.

## may a stranger offer condolences for your partner's unfortunate death?
thanks.

## yes, effie?
no, that'll be all.

## you have it?
no.

## why should i sit here and let people come in and stick me up?
certainly it is only natural that i try to save the owner...... such a considerable expense if possible.

## who is he?
mr. spade, you'll forgive my not answering that question.

## would that do?
it might.

## you will take, say, $100?
no.

## what's your second guess?
that you know where it is, or at least you know it is where you can get it.

## you're not hiring me to do murders or burglaries...... but simply to get it back if possible, in an honest, lawful way?
if possible.

## may i please have my gun now?
i don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble.

## you aren't exactly the sort of a person you pretend to be, are you?
why, i'm not sure i know exactly what you mean.

## do you know him?
only slightly.

## about what?
about me.

## what did you talk about then?
he offered me $5, 000 for the black bird.

## you won't go around straightening things and poking the fire again, will you?
no, i'm not.

## what did you say?
i said $5, 000 was a lot of money.

## what else is there i can buy you with?
i don't care what your secrets are.

## what are you waiting for?
i've got to talk to joel cairo.

## hello?
i want to leave a message for joel cairo.

## that again?
you know that's true, though.

## you'll let me go about it with him...... in my own way?
sure.

## what boy?
a kid.

## did he follow you to my apartment?
i shook him before that.

## when will the money be ready?
it is ready.

## in cash?
yes.

## you're ready to pay $5, 000 if we turn over the falcon to you?
excuse me, please.

## then, where is it?
where floyd hid it.

## then why do we have to wait a week?
perhaps not a whole week.

## and why, if i may ask another question, are you willing to sell it to me?
because i'm afraid.

## what exactly did happen to floyd?
the fat man.

## is he here?
i don't know.

## what difference does it make?
it might make a world of difference.

## but, shall we add, more certainly...... the boy outside?
yes.

## when you're slapped you'll take it and like it.
what was his name?

## who's that?
i don't know.

## what now?
we want to talk to you.

## do we have to do it out in the hall?
you can't come in.

## why don't you be reasonable?
it would pay you to play along with us.

## is there anything to it?
not a thing.

## anything to that?
talk is that's why he was put on the spot.

## haven't you anything better to do than to pop in here...... early every morning asking fool questions?
take it easy.

## i guess you are.
and the other?

## did you do that?
i had to.

## you know how that is, lieutenant?
but we didn't hurt him enough to make him cry for help.

## what have you got to say to that?
i don't know what to say.

## facts?
ask him.

## the cut?
no.

## is that all you want, lieutenant?
i think i'll be going now.

## what's the hurry, cairo?
there is no hurry.

## do you always carry on so highhanded?
well, you've had your talk with cairo.

## am i a prisoner?
maybe the boy outside hasn't gone home yet.

## do you suppose he's still there?
likely.

## would you do something wild and unpredictable?
i might.

## what makes it so important?
i don't know.

## that was in istanbul?
marmara.

## what's the bird made of?
porcelain or black stone.

## was there any truth at all in that yarn?
some.

## who?
cairo.

## new york, aren't you?
shove off.

## i won't forget you guys.
why do you let these cheap gunmen hang around the lobby...... with their heaters bulging in their clothes?

## what is it?
i don't know.

## say, what about miles?
i'll see you, luke.

## what could i do?
i had to.

## for how long?
till a little while ago.

## shake out?
not one thing.

## anything else?
the da's office called.

## gutman, huh?
thanks, darling.

## did that boy follow you?
no, angel.

## you saw joel this morning?
yeah.

## why?
because, true love, i need to keep in touch...... with all the loose ends of this dizzy affair if i'm ever to make heads or tails of it.

## what's your woman's intuition say about her?
she's all right.

## you mean at home?
yeah.

## is she in any danger, sam?
i think she is.

## what made you think of that?
i was mad, sam.

## by the way...... where were you the night miles was murdered?
home.

## well, now?
you begin well, sir.

## you're a close mouthed man?
you're the man for me, sir.

## are you here as miss o'shaughnessy's representative?
there's nothing certain either way.

## it depends on?
maybe it depends on joel cairo.

## the question is which do you represent?
it'll be one or the other.

## who else is it?
there's me.

## don't we all?
i don't trust a man who says he's not.

## mr. spade, have you any conception...... of how much money can be got for that black bird?
no.

## you mean, you don't know what that bird is?
i know what it's supposed to look like...... and i know the value in human life you people put on it.

## what is your impression?
there's not much to go by.

## well, sir, where is it?
i don't know.

## why not, if you've nothing to conceal?
everybody has something to conceal.

## the cheaper the crook, the gaudier the patter, huh?
well, let's go.

## well, what's this?
by gad, sir, you're a chap worth knowing.

## crusaders or something, weren't they?
very good.

## have you any conception of the extreme...... the immeasurable wealth of the order of that time?
they were pretty well fixed.

## ... what do you think of that?
i don't know.

## you begin to believe me a little?
i haven't said i didn't.

## then, the bird doesn't really belong to any of you, but to a general kemidov?
well, sir, you might as well say it belonged to the king of spain.

## and now, sir...... before we start to talk prices, how soon can you...... or how soon are you willing to produce the falcon?
i will give you $25, 000 when you deliver the falcon to me...... and another $25, 000 later on.

## in your own words, why not?
that's a lot of dough.

## what's the maximum?
the maximum, i refuse to guess.

## she didn't show up?
you get back to the office and wait there till i come or you hear from me.

## anybody burn?
no.

## someone i know came what?
someone i know came aboard this afternoon.

## why couldn't he have stayed alive long enough to tell us something?
here, here, here, none of that now.

## who?
oh, yes.

## where?
burlingame, 26 ancho.

## may i borrow your pencil?
sure.

## say, frank?
hello, mr. spade.

## you got plenty of gas?
sure thing.

## do you know where ancho street is in burlingame?
no, but we'll find her.

## bum steer, mr. spade?
yeah.

## is effie there?
no, no.

## are you sure that was her voice?
well, it was hooey.

## nothing said about the bundle, huh?
that's swell.

## did they take you down to the hall?
all right, precious.

## can you make it or shall i carry you?
i'll be all right as soon as i can get some place where i can lie down.

## are you ready to make the first payment and take the falcon off my hands?
well, sir, as to that....

## $10, 000?
yes, sir, we were.

## three?
there's only two, because thursby certainly killed your partner.

## let's give them the gunsel.
what's the difference?

## he actually did shoot thursby and jacoby, didn't he?
anyway, he's made to order for the part.

## mighty funny, eh?
mighty funny.

## any better, precious?
much better.

## do you want a drink, angel?
be careful, sam.

## well?
if you're really serious, the least we can do in common politeness is to hear you out.

## now, how would you be able to fix it so that wilmer couldn't do us any harm?
get up on your feet.

## want to hear it?
you want the falcon.

## if i know you can't afford to kill me, how'll you scare me into giving it to you?
sir, there are other means of persuasion besides killing and threatening to kill.

## you see what i mean?
if you start something, i'll make it a matter of your having to kill me or call it off.

## well?
you can have him.

## you have the envelope?
miss o'shaughnessy has it.

## why did he shoot thursby and why, where and how did he shoot captain jacoby?
i've got to know all that happened so the parts that don't fit are covered up.

## you didn't try to make a deal before giving him the works?
we did.

## you touched off the boat before you left?
no, not intentionally.

## and how about the shooting?
we caught up with miss o'shaughnessy and jacoby at her apartment.

## put the pot on, will you?
i don't like to leave our guests.

## hadn't you better leave the envelope in here?
sit on it, if you're afraid of losing it.

## well?
i want to know about this.

## i palmed it?
yes.

## do you want to say so, or stand for a frisk?
you'll admit it, or i'll search you.

## later you'll give me millions, but...... how's about $15, 000 now?
frankly and candidly, upon my word of honor as a gentleman...... $10, 000 is all the money i can raise.

## dangerous?
very.

## how's the coffee coming, angel?
in a few minutes.

## can you start getting it now?
i guess so.

## anything else?
no.

## are you going?
seventeen years i've wanted that item, and have been trying to get it.

## you don't?
frankly, sir, i'd like to have you along.

## sergeant polhaus there?
yeah.

## tom?
i thought he betrayed me.

## right?
i didn't mean to at first, really, i didn't.

## right?
something like that.

## you killed miles and you're going over for it.
when thursby wouldn't tackle him...... you took his gun and did it yourself, right?

## how can you do this to me, sam?
surely, mr. archer wasn't as much to you as....

## what have we got on the other side?
all we've got is that maybe you love me and maybe i love you.

## would you have done this if the falcon were real and you got your money?
don't be too sure i'm as crooked as i'm supposed to be.

## what's the matter with your playmate?
he looks brokenhearted.

## well, shall we be getting down to the hall?
it's heavy.

## what is it?
the stuff that dreams are made of.

## how'd it go?
lousy.

## how was your day?
it was great.

## really?
we found a boot print.

## isn't that amazing?
that is amazing.

## this don't bother you?
of course it  bothers me, mate.

## what the do you want me to do?
