## are you retarded?
no, i'm not retarded.

## am i right, tom?
oh, i...

## i wasn't too rough on her, was i?
well, she is new and all.

## but do you understand what i'm dealing with?
i mean, here i am trying to fill a position in creative, and i can't seem to find one person responsible enough to earn my trust.

## so you don't think i was out of line?
well, if what you're saying is that a company is only as strong as its weakest link, that makes sense, but...

## what?
no.

## tom.
yeah?

## are you ok?
uh... yeah, sure.

## well, why don't you go in there and tell him you're not gonna do it?
i can't just...

## i mean, live your own life and have a free weekend?
no, it's not that.

## tom?
i know this might seem a little out of place because we barely even know each other.

## but, do you have any plans tonight?

## those socks are clean, right?
um...

## are you serious?
if you want to watch tv, the remote's there.

not anymore.

## i have to shove these down his throat?
just one.

## he doesn't bite, does he?
no.

## you're not planning on taunting him, are you, tom?
no.

## henderson?
i thought you fired him.

## because his ideas were stupid?
of course not.

## hans?
lisa's boyfriend.

## you're housesitting?
you gotta be kidding me.

no, and, no, actually i had a girlfriend, but we, uh, broke up.

## so, you broke up, huh?
that's too bad.

## was your ex a looker?
yeah.

## can i see it?
just because i don't feel like revealing personal details about my ex girlfriend's sexual habits does not make me uptight.

## well, then, what the hell do you consider personal?
oh, yeah.

## could you do me a favor?
it's no big deal.

## what?
a business associate of my dad's is gonna come by to pick this up.

## will you give it to him?
just one second.

## he's got you living with him now?
uh, no.

## he is?
listen, i'm really sorry about that.

## how can you fire someone for making a bad cup of coffee, huh?
i know.

## i mean, who do you think you are juan fucking valdez?

## you swear on your mama's life?
hell, woman, i ain't gonna swear on my mama's life.

## why not?
if you're telling the truth.

## then why won't you swear on your mama's life?
well, because i don't feel like i have the right to gamble with my mama's life, that's why.

## gamble?
all right.

## can we please just use fists?
yes.

## so what if it's open?
you can't...

## jenny, darling, do you know where he's staying?
i have some information which might be helpful for him.

## we'll have dinner soon, yes?
that'd be lovely.

## why?
because bogomil would kill me.

## how can you be sure it'll be drugs?

he does everything by the book.

## ls everybody in this town a robot?
this thing is very personal to me.

## jenny, how are you?
this is my buddy billy rosewood.

that's serge.

## you want it with a lemon twist?

## didn't they teach you that in cop school?
i find some evidence, i'll get you.

## ls there any chance you'll let me go in by myself?
no chance.

## what are you looking for?
this.

## coffee?
yeah, it's coffee on top.

## what are you going to do with him?
you should be more worried about what we're going to do with you.

## did you say something?
lf something happens to her...

## really?
that would be a neat trick.

## are you still pissed at me?
no.

## how's that little bump on the head i gave you in detroit?
sorry, sarge, i can't talk now.

## was he calling from the hotel?
no, sir.

foley was looking over maitland's house.

## do you have that warehouse address?
yes, sir.

## billy, why are you here?
i forced him at gunpoint.

## what do you think i'm doing?

## you know what i want?
i want you to be more like tony, here.

## i don't have good posture?
i'm saying you're a neanderthal.

it's going to take him ten weeks to serve it.

## don't you have a courthouse to find?

let me guess.

## what do you mean?
he served you first.

## third grade?
yeah, sometimes.

## how about that, huh?
whatever.

## what would have happened if i'd served him first?
okay, if you had served him first the trial would have been in new york not in texas where you would have fared a lot better.

## i've already told them that i served you, okay?
so if i flip it and tag your husband my reputation will be shot.

## it's worth $20 million. $20 million?
mm hmm.

## ten percent of half?
mm hmm.

## you're really serious?
i think we should draw up a contract.

## all right, got my papers and you know your way around this place, right?
yeah, well, all you have to do is point him out and then stay out of sight because if he sees you, we're done.

## is it okay if i strangle him from behind?
yes, you can do whatever you want but wait until i serve him.

## so, what part of london are you from?
hampstead.

## well, i don't think it's important to talk about money at this point, do you?
you see, pounds... money...

you made us look like fools in there.

## i did?
well, hey, at least i wasn't beaten up by a girl.

## he's just going to sit around, waiting for us to serve him?
no, he's history.

## i don't like your tone.
all he has to do is jump on the first international flight and then we're done, all right?

## oh, you don't like my tone, your highness?
don't forget, whenever i want, i can serve your papers again.

## okay, where do you want to go... boss?
well, as your boss, i'd be interested in your suggestions.

## natalie, who did this to you?
we've got to call the police.

## what are you talking about?
shelly.

## shelly...?

and then i started to take a closer look.

## shelly paid you?
shelly wants me gone.

## no, don't you see?
that was before.

## i walk up there, i'd want to shoot myself.
maybe shelly will take it as a down payment, and we can pay in installments, when we get settled, okay?

## i suppose you'd like that freak show, huh, harvard?
yeah, i do.

## are you listening to me?
i will fucking kill you.

## how could you do that to her?

## mine?
oh, no.

## you wanna see him killed in prison?
no.

## or sent to a facility for the criminally insane?

## how could you bring him here?
that mobster in my house, eating off of my dishes.

## you have to bring home a gangster?

i know this is a terrible imposition, but it's not like i wanted him here.

## what?

i don't know.

## did you run him for priors?
a couple duls, one pot bust.

## did you find the boots?

he's not a neatness freak.

## sloppy enough to leave footprints, but smart enough to steal shoes in advance?
this is our guy, no question.

## you find any caviar jars?
come on, wait a minute.

## you're ticked that i got him, aren't you?

behind the vanilla fudge ice cream.

## ever heard of a ritual mutilator, an impulsive serial type killer...... committing suicide?
don't do that.

there's a reason.

i don't care if i'm losing it.

## how did you come by this?
it was the weirdest thing.

## what is this?
don't ask, don't tell.

## when will we know?
depends on the lab.

## see you.
want me to call him?

## what's this?
a purchase order for the dna...

## you need some time off?
nope, i'm fine.

## you want to see doc sluzer again?
no.

## you hear me?
hi, it's cass.

## so you'll run an analysis on that puke?
i don't remember doing it.

## with the dna, can they do that?
i doubt it.

## you doubt it?
i doubt it.

## what?
california uses a gas chamber.

## don't worry, i'm not a backstabber like you, richard.
you told her you tutor me too?

## that's a good boy.
how am i a back...?

## where are you going?
we can't be seen together.

## do you think this is some kind of game?
come on, come on.

## like what?
i don't know.

## do they?
they just don't know how to ask for it.

## what do you want?
richard, get out of the way.

## you think i'm too young?
there was a killer at your school.

## what do you mean?
raymond feathers.

## with that degenerate?
no.

## so you're friends with his old lady too?
you're a tease.

you can't handle it, so you're leaving?

## just as a friend, okay?
thank you.

## really?
they barely have parents.

no.

## rod knows?
he got a call from richard's father.

## so nobody wants to work with me?
that's okay.

## who paid for this?
cassie, out of her own pocket.

## they'll talk without an attorney?
they want to prove they're smarter than we are.

## who?
the hot one.

## you get to work with her everyday?
yeah.

## so, what's up with ray?
i hear he's like a serial killer or something.

## can i lay it out for you?
yeah.

## do you believe it?
it's a school paper.

## was it random?
i mean, that's the way i'd do it.

## you understand what random means?
don't get impatient.

## how do you mean?
if you kill somebody to prove you're free, and then throw up...

## what are you talking about?
richard didn't feel guilty.

## are we almost done?
take a seat.

## what are you talking about?
you went home, you said hello to your mother.

## she never did, did she?
i was with six friends all night.

## the planting bed was dry, so where did they come from?
it was you at the house.

## how long did you wait for her to come home?
i gotta say, that was a stroke of genius.

## did you think it up, or was it justin?
i don't know what you're saying.

## what are you looking at?
richard killed her.

## didn't he, justin?
i think it was justin.

## she went out with richard?
briefly.

## justin's here?
he told us about you.

## which lisa?
so you really need to tell me what happened.

## is richard a pole vaulter?
i don't know.

## where did you get that?
this is none of your god...

## left for work?
she couldn't, she had to go right then.

## why then?
i don't know.

## what are you gonna say?
nothing.

## did you ever get help for any of this?
yeah.

## so you want to talk to me about this covington woman?
yes, i know all about it.

## what can i do for you?
i just thought you'd want to know what really happened.

## how do you get away with it?
we were bored.

## did you make a deal with him?
he says he wasn't there...

## did you make a deal?
i don't make deals over the phone, but if it checks out...... and we can get a conviction, i will.

## where are you going?
you're not supposed to leave without telling us.

## will you be back for dinner?
justin's not here.

## what about goldilocks?
get over there and see what she knows.

## are you with her?
no.

## where are you?
i left home.

## all right?
i'm gone.

## do you remember what we talked about?
yes.

## okay?
okay.

## to do what?
i just have to.

## should we say the words for the last time?
one cannot live fully without embracing suicide and crime.

## what about you?
they're here at the old wintu lodge.

## so since i have the bullets and the guts to use them...... i'll shoot you, and then i'll shoot myself, okay?
no.

## or do you think you'll beat prison?
shoot me in the head, in the heart.

## you think you're so smart, huh?
justin's smarter than you, remember that.

## i'm okay, thank you.
... every night, the same fucking thing?

## what's gonna happen to me?
since you weren't the actual killer, and what you did down there for me....

## you all right?
whisper something into my ear.

## what?
just anything.

## where was it?
i want to take that back.

## did they find the videotape?
yes.

## how's he doing?
he looks okay.

## why did you let richard videotape the killing?
that was really stupid, like you guys wanted to get caught.

## oh, you don't know?
they found a hidden camera in richard's basement.

## is there really a tape?
maybe i should talk to a lawyer.

## are you gonna do it or what?
you don't do anything.

## jessica marie hudson?
jessica marie hudson.

## jessica marie hudson?
that's me.

## you think you can go to school?
i don't know.

## have you seen my tie with the burgundy stripes?
dry cleaner.

## gray and red one?
i heard that.

## so?
you can sleep all morning.

## i feel so cold.
honey?

## you ever coming out of there, honey?
hey...

## are you getting sick?
i can't afford not to go to work tomorrow.

## are you okay?
oh, my...

## we've got about 30 suspected cases in the l. a. region, with six deaths so far.
josh?

## what does it look like?
it's not anthrax, it's not smallpox.

## to track the links between victims?
yes, and to predict the spread of the illness.

## your guy's already got clearance?
yes, at the highest level.

## is there a problem?
you just never told me.

## are we putting out any kind of public health alert?
an infectious pathogen is categorized as a weapon of mass destruction.

## and if it keeps spreading?
it is imperative that we avoid a public panic.

## right?
where it started.

## and what do you know so far?
we have several hot spots associated with two or more victims.

## in the days leading up, did josh go anywhere out of the ordinary?
no.

## late... late from work?
he's been in san diego the last few days.

## did your wife go anywhere out of the ordinary over the last few days?
it's been a normal week.

## and you live in...?
hancock park.

## no classes today?
nah.

## are you working on something for don?
it's a, um... it's a genetics project for a... for a friend in the bio department, actually.

## huh?
your friend.

## does it matter?
no, of course not.

## uh, where you going right now?
my book club.

## mm hmm, and where's that?
phil's house.

## you keeping track of me?
no.

## actually, you know what?
i've written it out.

## is it a person or a place?
what the cdc calls a patient zero.

## where are the new patients we need to find?
looks sort of like a plant.

## how's it going?
uh, good.

## any more data on the victims?
11 more.

## commander havercamp?
this material just pushed us over the tipping point.

## see it?
the commonality of location.

## it's like two trees growing from the same root, right?
one to the north, and it's one south.

## don?
i'm not so sure about this finding.

## a nd...?
spanish flu.

## how'd they stop it?
nothing.

## in the united states?
600, 000.

## in six months?
i think we have to tell him, don.

## well, so what?
traffic downtown's always terrible.

## and then downtown, isn't there's that, uh...?
yeah, there's that protest march.

## bowling?
or golf.

## but you don't want me to go downtown?
yeah.

## okay, can we leave it at that?
well, i'll take your concerns under consideration.

## so, what, you're saying you resurrected the 1918 strain?
viral pathogens can exist for decades hidden in nature, only to suddenly reenter the human population.

## and what about personnel, have they gone on vacation, anybody called in sick, anything like that?
uh... no, not recently.

## why do you say that?
because the spanish flu pathogen is handled only by experienced professionals.

## you know all of them?
many of them, yes, as a matter of fact.

## you like her for this?
like an arsonist who sets a fire so he can be the first person on a scene to report it.

## forcing more federal funding?
i'd like to run down that angle.

## my reaction?
my reaction is...

## you sure it's the spanish flu?
oh, yeah.

## what kind of question is that?
of course, you're sure.

## are you kidding?
i know its gene fragments better than my own girlfriend.

## are you looking for something in particular?
not really.

## which reunion?
15th.

## what year'd you graduate?
1990.

## do what?
release the virus.

## well, why else would you be here talking to me about the spanish flu?
besides, the word is out in the bio community.

## i know exactly how dangerous it is, okay?
i am freaked.

## but?
well, if it's in the population, outside the lab taking lives, then the rush to develop a vaccine is very urgent.

## i'm sorry, can you not do that?
he's just doing his job.

## you sure about that?
i can't stress how serious a matter this is, sir.

## what if we're wrong about union station in the first place?
charlie, look, it is a classic dispersal site.

## you all right?
every minute that goes by...

## how do you forgive yourself if you're wrong?
you don't.

## larry... you have a minute?
yes, because we all have exactly the same number of minutes, at all times.

## do we not?
oh, my.

## and how can something be logical and mathematically suspect?
i mean, as you are so fond of saying, math is logic.

## when you met me just now, was i going out or coming into the library?
i see your point.

## right?
right.

## why isn't the virus spreading in all directions?
because it wasn't released on a train... we would've found illnesses among passengers.

## so how do we explain why the virus spreads north and south?
well, i don't know, but union station is definitely a point of commonality for the victims.

## i mean, it may not be the only one, right?
i'll give you that.

## so what does that mean?
more sick people will be linked to the bus terminal than to the train station.

## what am i reading this right, that people to the north are getting sicker than people to the south?
80  of the deaths link to the north pattern.

## what if there's two different viruses?
two strains of the same virus... traveling in two different directions.

## what's the likelihood of two strains appearing naturally, in the same ace, at the same time?
a statistical impossibility.

## the less lethal one?
well, now that we know about the buses, we can find victims we might have missed.

## where've you been?
uh, bowling.

## really?
no, of course not.

## look, if everybody can be down there, why can't i?
i got this fuzzy feeling you and your brother have been going downtown, too.

## huh, am i right?
okay.

## do you understand?
look, charlie, your brother puts himself on the line every day on that job of his.

## huh?
but i know how vital that job is to him.

## you know what i'm really proud of?
i'm proud that i've raised two sons... well, we've raised two sons who have a great sense of public service.

## huh?
yeah, sure.

## this is russell's strain, yeah?
and this is gen o's.

## i'm looking at you ; what do i see?
everything... and nothing.

## but are we talking about a charged black hole in anti de sitter space?
sure.

## you serve the warrant on grolsch?
no.

## you said he referred to a girlfriend?
yeah, he did.

## mr. grolsch, when we spoke before, you neglected to mention that you came to california from maryland.
enough to push him over the edge?

## after you grabbed me, did you put my groceries in the refrigerator?
i had some frozen items in there.

## where were you employed back east?
russell labs you know that already or else i wouldn't be here.

## you're linked to this outbreak in two ways, do you understand that?
and as far as we could tell, you're the only person with access to both strains.

## what were the two companies in competition for?
i think maybe it's time that i had my lawyer present.

## and what's the name of that company?
craigmac pharmaceuticals.

## so that's why you stole the virus, to help gen o and make yourself rich?
it sure as hell wasn't to release it.

## you think he was desperate enough to release both viruses just to prove gen o's was more deadly?
maybe ; but like he said, there's also janice avery and dr. weaver.

## as soon as that data comes in, you guys get it to me, understand?
all right, see you in a little.

## hey, don, did, um... did mom... did she suffer?
no.

## the national security agency?
yeah, a couple years ago, uh, bob tomkins called me.

## assistant director robert tomkins?
bob.

## really?
they never told me that.

## such as?
russell labs might not have the best pathogen, but they've got a ceo who's got a good contact at the fda.

## hello?
dr. weaver.

## how about we talk on the phone?
um, i'm driving right now.

## where are you?
i'd be happy to arrange a time to see you tomorrow.

## where is he?
approaching hancock park.

## you wanted to prove your virus was more powerful, so you tested it on innocent people?
yes.

## save lives?
20 people are dead.

## what do you got?
candles.

## did you think i was planning to release the virus again?
let's go.

## so, how are you two guys doing?
well, you seem so much more relaxed than the last couple of days.

## what are you two up to?
bowling.

## it was nothing like this, you know?
i hope not, charlie.

## we have troops stationed all over the globe, right?
all right, stop.

## all right?
i wouldn't have it any other way.

## wouldn't you like to know?
come on.

## what was it?
i really can't tell you.

## did you bring the pom poms?
i brought something to help you sleep.

## what is this?
nurse on the night shift said he came in about 4.

## how are you feeling?
i'm okay.

## what are you doing here?
i figured you'd want an immediate report.

## so?
we got everything.

## the boots?
that's an affirmative.

## was it in a jar behind a stack of magazines...... or in the freezer under the turkey thigh?
behind the vanilla fudge ice cream.

## suicide?
yeah.

## ever heard of a ritual mutilator, an impulsive serial type killer...... committing suicide?
don't do that.

## why did he run if he didn't do it?
there's a reason.

## rod?
i don't care if i'm losing it.

## how did you come by this?
it was the weirdest thing.

## what is this?
don't ask, don't tell.

## when will we know?
depends on the lab.

## see you.
want me to call him?

## what's this?
nope, i'm fine.

## you want to see doc sluzer again?
no.

## you hear me?

## so you'll run an analysis on that puke?
i don't remember doing it.

## with the dna, can they do that?
i doubt it.

## what?
california uses a gas chamber.

## don't worry, i'm not a backstabber like you, richard.
you told her you tutor me too?

## that's a good boy.
how am i a back?

## where are you going?
we can't be seen together.

## do you think this is some kind of game?
i don't know.

## do they?
they just don't know how to ask for it.

## you think you're so smart, huh?
justin's smarter than you, remember that.

## i'm okay, thank you.
every night, the same fucking thing?

## what's gonna happen to me?
since you weren't the actual killer, and what you did down there for me....

## you all right?
whisper something into my ear.

## what?
just anything.

## where was it?
i want to take that back.

## did they find the videotape?
yes.

## how's he doing?

## go ahead and talk, eggman.
don't you care what happens to pretty, young sarah?

## really, sonic?
someone has to get through all of black eggman's traps.

why should i have to clean up after you?

## tails, take this with you.

## tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that eggman gave you?
let me check.

## these?
that's what it says.

## which way to eggmanland?
we know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish this game later.

## it doesn't matter.
why me?

## i guess i can just put this on your tab.
you're running away?

## what does all this mean, eggman?
i don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.

## isn't it obvious?
i'm going to use metal to destroy the real sonic, and then i'm going to destroy the land of the sky.

## what?
that's right.

## i'm sorry, was that uncomfortable, sarah?
come on, don't be mad.

## hey, hey, what about sonic?
what a nice, peaceful night.

## where am i?
tails...

## he forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
old man, where are you?

## i think i can use that.
he flew away?

## but what if metal sonic and sonic aren't in the same place any more?
don't worry.

## how come?
well, all of sonic's data was input into metal's memory.

## who are you?
i'm knuckles, sonic's best friend.

## did you stop the generator?
yes, it suits you very well, sarah.

## what do you mean?
once metal has destroyed the land of the sky, it'll just be the two of us.

## if the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion, the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice.
are you crazy?

## what do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support?
due to the centrifugal force of the planet, they'll be thrown into outer space.

## why me?
after all, it used to be eggman's.

## what?
then this will be the real fight.

## this world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
well, the feeling's mutual.

## well...
more importantly, what happened to sarah?

## who is that?
lmpressive, tails.

## what did you do that for?
so now we're finally even, sonic.

## hey, can i get another drink down here?
i've been to prison once.

get down on your knees.

## any idea?

twice.

## what did you think of him?
we had our reservations about each other.

## isn't it a little late to be asking me that?
no, not necessarily.

## you're not surprised?
sean feels he hasn't done thejob unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.

## what was this, uh, chimera, nekhovich was carrying?
only ambrose knows that.

## excuse me?
miss hall and ambrose had a relationship... which he took very seriously.

## and then what?
well, make sure she continues to see him, gets him to confii de in her, and report to you.

## what, to go to bed with a man and lie to him?
sean ambrose, for one.

## oh, let my conscience be my guide, is that it?
something like that.

one considers her timing, ofcourse.

you gave me your word and i believed you.

## so don't even hope for a ufo, that would have been too interesting.
all right, you're not thinking about yourself, but what about us?

## where's he going?
he wants to be alone, i guess.

## why?
even with the three of us together, i feel weird.

## and what does that mean?
you see, being a stalker is some sort of calling.

## like what?
well, you know, the leather stockings, chingachgook sort of things...

## or was it just a figure of speech?
one day porcupine returned from here and got rich overnight.

## you call it punishment?

## may i?
the wind is coming up...

## can you feel it?
the grass...

## of my own will.
what do you mean?

## what else?
i thought it was you...

## why did you stop me?
i didn't stop you.

## you?
who the hell knows...

## what?
stop it.

## so it lets the good ones pass and kills the bad ones?
i don't know.

## have you come to your senses, professor?

## are we on our way already?
of course.

## why?
i thought you just wanted to show us something.

## what about it?
forget about your knapsack.

the kids who get bit by, uh, radioactive insects or fall into a vat of toxic waste, their powers usually show up the next day.

## but i will get them, right?
many sidekicks are the offspring of one super parent, mmm, and one ordinary parent.

## like who?
well, i know of only one.

## ron wilson, bus driver?
there he is.

## a three and a half bath victorian with original crown molding?
you bet we'd love to take a look.

but i don't.

## what?
your hero flies north at 300 miles per hour for 15 minutes.

## hmm?
she was a weird one.

## why is that?

## warrers dad?
always swore he'd have his revenge on me.

## you know how you grow lima beans in school?
will could not figure out why mine grew so quickly.

## what?
i am not in love with will strong...

## is it that obvious?
yeah.

## so why don't you tell him?
well, i was gonna ask him to homecoming, but there's two problems.

## you know what i think?
to let true love remain unspoken is the quickest route to a heavy heart.

## you don't have a date for homecoming?
well, i've gotten a few offers, but...... i turned them down.

## me?
oh, hi, daddy.

## you're not that boy with the six arms, are you?
no, sir.

## yeah?
yeah, but you first.

## really?

## can you believe it?
me, a freshman, going with the most amazing girl at sky high.

i'm going too.

## yeah, who asked you?
oh, who asked me.

## warren peace?

try the other way around.

## but i'm not renting a tux.
does anyone else need a date for homecoming?

## hey, if warrers not here, is this still the tough guy table?

## think the committee could stop by?
ooh, i don't know because, uh, my parents are on a distress call, and they won't be home till late.

## i was just hoping we could spend a little more time together, but...... i guess i'll just see you at school?
please, just power down.

## how am i gonna get this place cleaned up in time?
here, come with me.

## so, what's on your mind?
my friends.

## i mean, don't you think they'd feel a little awkward?

## mom, you ever feel like you messed something up so bad that you'll never be able to fix it?
people make mistakes, will.

## guys?
i just want to say sorry because this whole thing was my fault.

## how were you supposed to know your girlfriend was a psychopath?
no, that's not it.

## josie?
but i'm afraid this doesn't belong to us.

## why don't we just call them what they really are, josie?
heroes.

## oh, and, jonathan?
whatever you're teaching them, keep teaching them it.

## i went through puberty twice... for this?
i have de pacified all the babies and destroyed that horrible weapon forever.

## hmm?
suddenly there was a terrible roar all around us... and the sky was full of what looked like huge bats...

## hmm?
never mind.

## well, i guess you're about ready then, aren't ya?
we're your friends.

## understand?
get in.

## what will he think then?
this same lonely desert was the last known home of the manson family.

## would he make that grim connection when my attorney starts screaming... about bats and huge manta rays coming down on the car?
if so, well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere.

## did they hear me?
it's okay.

## there's one thing you should probably understand can you hear me?
good.

## had we deteriorated to the level of dumb beasts?
this man at the wheel is my attorney.

i mean, if a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing right.

## what kind of story is this?
it's the mint 400... the richest off road race for motorcycles and dune buggies in the history of organized sport.

## how else can you cover a thing like this righteously?
well, we're gonna have to drum it up on our own.

## do you?
be over in 30 minutes.

## you're gonna be real careful with this car, right?
oh, yeah, man.

## what, were you going about, uh, oh, i don't know, 45 miles an hour backwards?

## oh?
i always test the transmission that way, the rear end for stress factors.

## hey, uh, listen, you you fellas haven't been, uh, drinking, have you?
