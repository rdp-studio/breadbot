as far as she knows, we're just observing and studying her.

## the same thing happen to sara?
no, no, no.

## have i stood in your way, sara?
this is your home, not a prison.

## that's the plan, right?
certainly.

## she came back last night, didn't she?
sara has eliminated our species as potential partners.

## hey, you know this project athena?

sara doesn't have any feelings.

## may i help you?
i need a room.

it's chess.

seen the departmental website today?

## what are you doing?
i gotta see just how crazy this chick is.

## have you done any unusual lab work in protoplastic cell suspension?

## what is it?
mass e mail.

## wasn't that shut down?
i want this girl found.

## feelings?
she's just gonna break your heart.

## who said i had feelings for her?
i understand the temptation, of course.

## listen, i know she's not attracted to humans, all right?
everything she does is only in her own biological interest.

## no one knows anything about this, right?
of course not.

## what's wrong?
i'd prefer it if dean took my blood.

## dean?
very well.

## what are you doing?
the first night of her maturity.

## absurd... can't possibly end like this.
listen to me, all right?

## i don't understand.
no, it's not, okay?

## you see that thing there?
that contains your eggs.

## alien ova, you understand?
the half breeds need it so they can create a viable continuation of their line.

## what about me?
sara, you could have a lifespan of 400 years, for all i know.

## and if i don't reproduce, the threat to your own species ends with me?
that's right.

## sara, are you in here?
we sh shouldn't do this.

## yeah, of course i do, but... why do you want me?
i just do.

## why don't you just think of it as a simple exchange of services?
fuck it.

## what about abbott?
he's gone, dude... went missing.

## amelia?
yeah.

## the honey on the internet?
the one who wanted the information on electroporation.

## you got in touch with her?
yeah.

## what are you talking about, hastings?
you left your notebook here one day.

## so what the hell is it?
look, i just...

## i can't tell you right now, all right?
i'm sorry.

## did i have any contact with alien life?
at that point, i'm like, \"all right, the chick really is crazy.

## this is a gas station, right?
fill it up.

## you sure you don't need something else?
done worn him out.

## lab?
i wanna see it.

## where did you get your specimen from, anyway?
we never talked about that.

## something wrong?
no.

## who else lives here?
no one.

## okay... look... you know it was all a joke?
the data i sent you was fake.

## now why don't you just tell me where you got it from?
i told you.

## why kidnap your roommate?
i can't be sure.

## a new species?
yeah.

## who'd you say you worked for?
i didn't.

## unfortunately, the current administration has much less of an appetite for science fiction, shall we say?
so i'm not here in an official capacity, and we won't be taking care of this in an official capacity.

## what are you gonna do?
you and i are taking care of this in an unofficial capacity.

## you can hack into abbott's database, right?
yeah, i think so.

## have you made any progress yet?
it's confusing, all this stuff.

## so what if he dies?
there's a college campus here.

## what are you looking at?
abbott made physiology schematics of the aliens.

## any weaknesses?
the half breeds have failing immune systems, so we should be able to kill amelia with any common contaminant.

## what kind of contaminant?
hydrochlorine gas.

## where do you think you're going?
this isn't my problem.

## what about later?
you're our only hope.

## what happens after that?
we'il have to grow it to maturity in a solution of carbon based molecules... a membrane bag, basically.

## what are you waiting for?
please... don't make me do this.

## what is that?
they should be coming out soon.

## so... how's things?
wonderful.

## is this them?
yeah, the dna and ova cells.

## who's this guy?
my driver.

## tokamak depressurizing.
where in the hell's dean?

## what are you guys up to, anyway?
he's taken control of the reactor.

## something wrong with my face?
one last thing.

## yeah.
why?

## how ya feeling?
not bad.

## did you see wasach on tv?
yeah... said you should come see him sometime in washington when you're feeling better.

## really?
it's all cool.

## you hungry?
yeah, sure.

## what the hell is going on here?
i'm just doing a little cleanup.

## what did you do?
there was still some remnants of the half breed dna, so i stripped away the damaging human strains and created him.

## why'd you do it?
maybe you'il find the answer to that someday.

## i didn't say he was fertile, did i?
you mean, you made him...

## what happens once they figure out he's sterile?
none other.

## what happened to him?
which brings me to the second course.

## have you heard of it?
i have not.

## looped off?
clean as dandelion heads, apparently.

## will you do this?
i shall.

## is it theodore?
i am only a stranger.

## can we proceed?
thank you.

## the heads are gone?
taken.

## is that what you believe?
seeing is believing.

## and the head..?
taken...

## what is?
in cases like this, the head is removed to prevent identification of the body.

## so why was it removed?
because.

## what is it?
the wound was cauterised, as though the blade were red hot.

## the fifth?
aye.

## operate?
to what is your purpose, is the question.

## what type of instruments are these?
some of my own design.

## what did you find out?
the widow winship was with child.

## who's there?
oh, pardon my intrusion.

## why did no one mention that the van garretts are kin to the van tassels?
hardly a household is not connected to every other by blood or marriage.

## should i show you?
yes.

## are you so certain of everything?
it was your mother's.

## what are these strange markings?
i've had them since i can remember.

## see?
carved into the fireback.

## are you all right?
yes, thank you.

## what are you running from, philipse?
you had a mind to help me.

## you knew the widow was expecting?
she told me.

## did she tell you the father's name?
yes.

## what is that thing?
my protection from the horseman.

## who's with me?
the van garretts, widow winship, your father, and now philipse.

## did your father deal with the van garretts?
he worked for them.

## the hessian?
that'il be him.

## what might he hear that he must keep away from?
he rides to the hollow and back.

## do you?
well, i'm here to find him and make him stop.

## what are you doing?
don't move or speak.

## madam, do you hear me?
you seek the warrior bathed in blood, the headless horseman.

## how will we recognise it?
without difficulty, i fear.

## his camp?
his grave.

## why have you come?
because no one else would go with you.

## what is it?
just stay where you are.

## ichabod?
split up.

## oh, isn't there?
let's get ready for bed.

## murdered by..?
murdered to save her soul.

## what do you believe in?
sense and reason.

## you'il take nothing from sleepy hollow that was worth the coming here?
no, not nothing.

## do you think me wicked?
no.

## why do you say that?
because you've bewitched me.

## sarah?
run away, like so many others.

## where is katrina?
she watched over you till dawn.

## what is the secret that unites them?
magistrate philipse knew there were five bodies to four graves.

## what does this point to?
we must proceed by process of elimination.

## have you thought of something?
yes...

## why is it here?
leave me alone.

## widow winship?
and here, look.

## your will?
because it is yours.

## was it wicked of me?
no, not at all.

## where did you go?
i had questions to ask hardenbrook.

## did you learn anything of interest?
perhaps.

## why is that?
perhaps he looked in your ledger and did not like what he saw.

## what have you there?
evidence.

## what is it?
help me move the bed.

## why did his friends conceal..?
you are the constable.

## what peril was there if it was my father who controlled the horseman?
goodbye.

## did she say anything?
only that she will not come down.

## how did you..?
i know you saw me.

## what?
hanged himself in the night.

## hanged himself?
there's a church meeting tonight.

## what is that?
i was careless with the kitchen knife.

## how can you think so?
you are bewitched by reason.

## did you think it was a nasty dream?
father saw the horseman kill you.

## who are you?
my family name was archer.

## is he dead?
he was dead to begin with.

## where are we going?
run, katrina.

## jean francois?
world police.

## you got a fix?
i got him, carson.

## about what?
i was thinking that i want you to marry me.

## who's joking?
joe to sarah.

## he finally popped the question?
lisa, you're an amazing woman.

## how do you make yourself so somber and emotional to make everybody cry like that?
it's not that hard, really.

## i don't believe we've met, mr...?
the name is spottswoode.

## hey, hold on a second, are you from hollywood?
i have an incredible offer for you, gary.

## all right, just what the hell is this about?
i hate to break this to you, gary, but some people out there want you dead.

## dead?
they're called terrorists, gary.

## what did i do to them?
i'm just a broadway actor.

## you?
baxter, i think we can \"valmorphanize \"safely now.

## have you seen a man eat his own head?
no.

## and just what does this have to do with me?
our only hope is to have somebody act like a terrorist who wants to help them carry out the attack.

## an actor with a double major in theatre and world languages?
hell, you're the perfect weapon, gary.

## that's supposed to be carson's replacement, a fucking actor?
don't mind chris.

## where's lisa?

i was just wondering if i can let go of an old, painful memory.

## is it anything that you wanna talk about?
when i was a kid, i always looked up to my older brother, tommy.

## what?
i met somebody who took my breath away.

## so, what, you're just gonna shut down?
i really like you.

a just question my lord.

## do i make myself clear?
yes, sir.

## senators, are there any others who wish to speak?
then i call for a vote on the motion to open trade negotiations with celes ll.

## would someone alert security?
this is all a damned inconvenience.

## sir?
shut up.

## yes?
no.

## no?
oh, very well, then.

## you ever think about getting married again?
no.

## are you all right?
captain, i do not think it is appropriate for a starfleet officer to appear... naked.

## what can you be afraid of?
captain, i am picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the kolarun system.

## what sort of signature?
positronic.

## what do we know about it?
uncharted.

## theories?
just what i was afraid of.

## captain?
diverting to the kolarus system takes us awfully close to the romulan neutral zone.

## a long lost relative?
i'm reading six distinct positronic signatures spread out over a few kilometers on the planet's surface.

## what do we know about the population on kolarus ill?
isolated pockets of humanoids.

## why do you have a shiny head?
this is not the appropriate time for a conversation.

## why?
because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.

## why?
because...

## have i said something wrong?
data.

## so what have we got, geordi?
well, i'd say he has the same internal mechanics as data but not as much positronic development.

## do you have a name, sir?
i am...

## can you tell us how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
i do not know.

## do you remember anything of your life before you were on the planet?
no.

## why does the tall man have a furry face?
number one, keep me informed and, uh, geordi, reassemble him.

## b 4, do you know who i am?
you are me.

## with or without the rest of the fleet?
a diplomatic mission.

## new praetor?
there's more.

## romulus?
i'm afraid the opal sea will have to wait, number one.

## yeah, but how did a reman get to be praetor?
i don't get it.

## coup d'tat?
praetor's power has always been the romulan fleet.

## what have we learned about shinzon?
starfleet lntelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record.

## you feel comfortable with that?
i feel nothing, geordi.

## b 4, do you know where you are?
i am in a room with lights.

## our father?
yes, dr. soong.

## do you know the name of the captain of this vessel?
captain...

## what?
this.

## do you mind if i keep him here for a while run a few diagnostics?
no, i do not mind.

## counselor?
they're out there, sir.

## praetor shinzon?
captain picard.

## isn't that odd?
you may scan me without subterfuge, commander data.

## no?
you are human.

## praetor?
i've never met a human woman before.

## may i touch your hair?
we came to romulus on a matter we were assured was of great importance.

## am i right?
yes.

## do you know of it, captain?
yes.

## in fact, i feel exactly what you feel... don't i, jean luc?
come to dinner tomorrow on romulus, just the two of us.

## or should i say... just the one of us?
i think you'il be wanting this.

## why?
i have a purpose.

## do i serve you?
yes.

## what must a woman do?
you... are not a woman.

## what happened?
as happens frequently here on romulus... a new government came to power.

## our eyes reflect our lives, don't they?
and yours are so confident.

## how did you end up on remus?
they sent me there to die.

## how could a mere human survive the dilithium mines?
not that it mattered, as i was no longer part of their plans against the federation.

## you're doing this to liberate the remans?
i knew they would never give us our freedom.

## and how many romulans died for your freedom?
too many.

## were we picards always warriors?
i think of myself as an explorer.

## well, were we always explorers?
i was the first picard to leave our solar system.

## source?
it's going to take some time to figure that out, captain.

## what programs were accessed?
well... that's what i can't figure out.

## remember him?
he was a bit cocky as i recall.

## is he very much the way you were?
oh, yes.

## deanna... what's the matter?
no.

## deanna... can you describe it?
it was a...

## why have you done this?
i was lonely.

## what are you going to do?
i need a sample of your blood.

## what is it your borg friends say?
resistance is futile.

## where?
out of my sight.

## what is all this about?
it's about destiny, picard.

## so what am l?
senators, consider the opportunities for the empire.

## do i make myself clear?
yes, sir.

## senators, are there any others who wish to speak?
then i call for a vote on the motion to open trade negotiations with celes il.

## would someone alert security?
this is all a damned inconvenience.

## sir?
shut up.

## yes?
no.

## no?
oh, very well, then.

## with or without the rest of the fleet?
a diplomatic mission.

## new praetor?
there's more.

## romulus?
i'm afraid the opal sea will have to wait, number one.

## yeah, but how did a reman get to be praetor?
i don't get it.

## coup d'etat?
praetor's power has always been the romulan fleet.

## what have we learned about shinzon?
starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record.

## you feel comfortable with that?
i feel nothing, geordi.

## b 4, do you know where you are?
i am in a room with lights.

## our father?
yes, dr. soong.

## do you know the name of the captain of this vessel?
captain...

## what?
this.

## do you mind if i keep him here for a while run a few diagnostics?
no, i do not mind.

## counselor?
they're out there, sir.

## praetor shinzon?
captain picard.

## isn't that odd?
you may scan me without subterfuge, commander data.

## no?
you are human.

## praetor?
i've never met a human woman before.

## may i touch your hair?
we came to romulus on a matter we were assured was of great importance.

## am i right?
yes.

## do you know of it, captain?
yes.

## in fact, i feel exactly what you feel... don't i, jean luc?
come to dinner... tomorrow on romulus, just the two of us.

## or should i say... just the one of us?
i think you'il be wanting this.

## why?
i intend to find out, number one.

## what possible purpose could that serve?
i have a purpose.

## do i serve you?
yes.

## what must a woman do?
you... are not a woman.

## what happened?
as happens frequently here on romulus... a new government came to power.

## our eyes reflect our lives, don't they?
and yours are so confident.

## how did you end up on remus?
they sent me there to die.

## how could a mere human survive the dilithium mines?
not that it mattered, as i was no longer part of their plans against the federation.

## you're doing this to liberate the remans?
i knew they would never give us our freedom.

## and how many romulans died for your freedom?
too many.

## were we picards always warriors?
i think of myself as an explorer.

## well, were we always explorers?
i was the first picard to leave our solar system.

## source?
it's going to take some time to figure that out, captain.

## what programs were accessed?
well... that's what i can't figure out.

## remember him?
he was a bit cocky as i recall.

## is he very much the way you were?
oh, yes.

## deanna... what's the matter?
no.

## deanna... can you describe it?
it was a...

## why have you done this?
i was lonely.

## what are you going to do?
i need a sample of your blood.

## what is it your borg friends say?
resistance is futile.

## where?
out of my sight.

## what is all this about?
it's about destiny, picard.

## so what am i?
my life is meaningless as long as you're still alive.

## an echo?
if your issues are with me, then deal with me.

## are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?
it amazes me how little you know yourself.

## what about the download?
shinzon believes he has our communication protocols but they will give him inaccurate locations for all starfleet vessels.

## data, what do you imagine this is?
port thruster, sir.

## data, can you open the shuttlebay doors?
negative, sir.

## do you think this is a wise course of action, sir?
we're about to find out, data.

## does that satisfy you?
for the moment.

## what's happening to his face?
commander, a moment.

## are you truly prepared to have your hands drenched in blood?
he's not planning to defeat earth.

## can anything be done for him?
nothing except a complete transfusion from the only donor with compatible dna... you.

## how long does he have?
i can't say for sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating.

## why?
because you are dangerous.

## why?
you have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.

## do you know anything about shinzon's plans against the federation?
no.

## do you have any knowledge of the tactical abilities of his ship?
no.

## can i move now?
no.

## what are you doing?
i must deactivate you.

## for how long?
indefinitely.

## how long is tha...?
a long time, brother.

## how can you be certain?
i know how he thinks.

## no way of penetrating his cloak?
no.

## you understand me?
yes, sir.

## how long?
a matter of hours.

## how long until we reach the rift?
seven minutes.

## how soon until we reach the fleet?
at our current velocity, we will arrive at sector 1045 in approximately 40 minutes, sir.

## sir?
he said he is a mirror.

## of you, sir?
yes.

## if i had lived his life, is it possible that i would've rejected my humanity?
the b 4 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced.

## how can you be sure?
i aspire, sir, to be better than i am.

## it's interfering with our uplink from starfleet cartography?
the rift affects all long range communica...

## can you learn to see in the dark, captain?
report.

## captain picard... will you join me in your ready room?
you can't trace my holographic emitters, captain, so don't bother.

## why are you here?
to accept your surrender.

## and the enterprise?
i have little interest in your quaint vessel, captain.

## waste it in a blaze of hatred?
there is a better way.

## assistance?
the empire considers this a matter of internal security.

## what?
you heard me.

## do you have life support?
for the moment.

## what is it?
she's here.

## did you check the system status?
report.

## what if we targeted all our phasers in a concentrated pattern?
the scimitar's shields are still at 70 percent.

## what's he doing?
he wants to look me in the eye.

## why should the rest of your crew have to die?
shinzon, i don't think i ever told you... about my first academy evaluation.

## some ideals are worth dying for, aren't they, jean luc?
thalaron intermix procedure initiated.

## how long until he can fire?
the targeting sequence should take about seven minutes, captain.

## how can he?
he'il kill you.

## data?
captain...

## what was that song?
can't remember the song.

## so... where's the titan off to?
the neutral zone.

## if i may, just a word of advice about your first command?
anything.

## my... my brother was not human?
no, he wasn't.

## who's on first?
i don't know.

## dear, who do you think is on first?
i'il have the turkey club without the bacon.

## you think you can beat me up?
you wouldn't want me to mess up that beautiful face of yours.

## is she not terrific?
she does have a way.

## you think she thinks i have a beautiful face?
well, they do work on tips.

## who says that?
she is really cool.

## you think she likes me?
i should've got the egg white omelet.

## who am i?
there's a million people to like.

## is it that far fetched?
maybe she sees something.

## is it possible?
no.

## you did?
yeah.

## you said you liked horse manure?
yeah.

## and it was around this point she mentioned the boyfriend?
yeah.

## oh, you think because of what i said about the manure?

## well, then she's just a liar, isn't she?
hey.

## you want something to eat, don't you?

i don't have it.

## do you really think she'd mind?
no, i don't think she'd mind.

## then i'm forgiven?
there's nothing to forgive.

## did i hear your name correctly, scott andrews?
yes, mr. jarrod.

## what are you doing now?
i'm doing a head of miss allen.

## would you be interested in some modeling for me, some originals i have in mind?
yes.

## who does she remind you of?
i've been wondering about that.

## you mean i look like she did?
exactly as she did.

## soon?
i'd be glad to.

## why should it seem so real?
i hate to drag you away.

## why did you scream?
i saw cathy again.

## enjoying yourself?
it's exciting.

## do nice people come here?
of course.

## you never saw a show like this in provincetown?
don't worry, your reputation is safe.

## what's wrong with that?
i knew her so well.

## how could he see that in a photograph?
how can he make it so real unless....

## what?
unless it is cathy.

## you say jarrod is a cripple?
he uses a wheelchair.

## why not?
they wore them then.

## you mean you'il investigate it?
of course he does.

## you think miss allen's fears are justified?
heck, no.

## that's wax, how could it be anything else?
leave it to a skirt to dream up a crazy idea like that.

## or was it that you came to see?
mr. jarrod, i'm so sorry.

## how do you do?
igor isn't impolite.

## does she still seem real to you?
as life itself.

## earrings?
i don't remember.

## was she, leon?
no.

## the police would remove the jewelry from the body, wouldn't they?
yet you were careful to show that both her ears had been pierced for them.

## do you like it?
it's sort of a shock to see your head detached that way.

## you know this fellow jarrod's quicker at finding these guys than we are?
that's what he says in his advertising.

## who'd want him?
we better find out pretty quick.

## did you read the blast in today's world?
yeah, it's dynamite.

## do you remember patterson, the deputy city attorney who disappeared?
sure.

## does booth look like wilbur, or am i crazy?
he does a tad with the brush off his lip.

## can't you read the sign?
i'm sorry.

## look, where'd you get the face for this guy that shot lincoln?
from photographs.

## they take them at that time?

## do you work here?
yeah.

## you make these things?
some of them.

## what's your name?
leon averill.

## what's yours?

## what do you know about his employees?

## do you remember that artist in sing sing who painted the last supper on his cell?
hendricks.

## carl hendricks?

## did you introduce yourself?
my daughter anne.

before workmen come.

## and where am l?
you and margot will be in there.

## you won't forget to take off your shoes, will you?
peter...... it's nice to have you with us.

## did you know that he went to the same school that?
it's comforting that mr. kraler and his secretary...... are down there below us, in the office.

## yes?
this is the box you asked for.

## can you imagine me?
you don't have to whisper now.

## know how i'm going to think of it here?
as a boarding house, a very peculiar boarding house.

## a pencil?
i'm going downstairs to get a pencil.

## never?
never.

## for instance...... remember that battle with your mother about overshoes?
you said you'd rather die than wear overshoes.

## what happened?
in the end, you had to wear them.

## isn't that good?
and the piano.

## still, what does that matter?
i want to write, but more than that...... i want to bring out all kinds of things...... that lie buried deep in my heart.

## what shoes?
you're gonna be sorry.

## i am?
gonna give mouschi his dinner.

## he isn't used to girls.
who wants to be dignified?

## isn't two months time?
i could cry.

## and what about miep?
she's usually so prompt.

## where would he be?
with his cat.

## he hasn't finished his lessons, has he?
your mother says to come out.

## is that any way for you to talk to your little girlfriend?
mother, i asked you...

## ... would you please not say that?
look, he's blushing.

## so what?
you're 1 6.

## you're warm.

## are you all right?
mother, please.

## you don't have a fever, do you?

## anne, you hear your mother, don't you?

## isn't that so, anne?
i keep wishing that peter was a girl instead of a boy.

## ls it miep?
it's strange we don't hear.

## yes, but how about algebra?
well, i have a confession to make.

## lsn't algebra vile, father?
vile.

## how did i do?
excellent, of course.

## mrs. van daan, may i try it on?
no, annie.

## mrs. van daan, did you have a lot of boyfriends before you were married?
annie, that's a personal question.

## how about it, mr. frank?
all right, all right.

## oh, i embarrass you too, do l?
let me tell you something.

## so what if she does?
i'm only telling the truth.

## haven't you finished?
no.

## shall we make our school coeducational?
thanks, yes.

## yes?
you are an angel, an absolute angel.

## why didn't i meet you before i met that one there?
i think it might be better if you went into your room, peter, to work.

## where are they?
at least one of them should've come.

## isn't it bad enough here without you sprawling all over?
if you didn't smoke, you wouldn't be so irritable.

## am i smoking?
i never heard grownups quarrel like that before.

## remember, mr. so and so, i am a lady.
i, rude?

## why do you show off all the time?
let me give you a little advice.

## do you know that?
a man likes a girl who'il listen to him.

## try to be like margot.
all ruined, and what do you care?

## and have them walk all over me the way they do her?
no, thanks.

## why aren't you like margot?
everything she does is right, and everything i do is wrong.

## yes?
it's miep.

## is it miep?
yes.

## now, let's see what they have to say about the nazis, huh?
berlin.

## must we listen?
all right, peter, that's enough.

## hm?
hm.

## kraler?
and miep, yes.

## did you hear him?
yes.

## you were, of course, quiet?
we didn't move.

## where is it?
mr. van daan.

## he begged me, could i find him a hiding place?
so i have come to you.

## ... but could you take him in?
well, of course we will.

## where?
there's so little food as it is  we can stretch the food a little.

## mr. otto frank?
yes.

## what can i say to thank you?
mr. kraler and miep...... they're our lifeline.

## how do you do?
margot.

## how do you do?
please, mr. dussel, sit down.

## you're not in switzerland, then?
someone said that you had escaped.

## and you've been here all this time?
ever since july.

## did mr. kraler warn you you won't get much to eat here?
you can imagine.

## do you know the de vries?
they're gone.

## gone?
yes, with all the others.

## do you know?
we should put this off.

## would you take mr. dussel to his room now?
if you'il come with me, mr. dussel.

## do you have any children, mr. dussel?
no, i never married.

## have you no family at all?
no one.

## a cat or a dog?
no.

## what?
peter has a cat.

## he has it here?
yes.

## it was just a dream.
sanne?

## you're here, safe, you see?
something must be done with that child.

## who knows who might be in the street?
she's endangering our lives.

## she'il be herself in a minute or two, won't you, annie?
go back to bed.

## perhaps if you told me?
yes, of course, anne, dear.

## do you want me to read to you?
no, just sit with me for a minute.

## do you think anyone outside heard me?
no.

## what's the matter with me?
tell me.

## why is it that every grownup thinks he knows the way to bring up children?
particularly the grownups that haven 't any.

## what will we do?
we can't go out in the street.

## what will we do?
if they hit this house, your worries will be over.

## music?
of course.

## do you know what i'd like right now?
a cup of tea.

## tea now or tomorrow morning?
tomorrow morning.

## sure?
sure.

## may i have the hats, please?
there's lots more.

## presents?
not this year, unfortunately.

## what kind of jew doesn't know hannukah?
i remember particularly the candles.

## what is it?
presents.

## real presents?
oh, it's beautiful.

## anything you 're told?
that's right.

## you wouldn't want to sell that, mrs. frank, would you?
never.

## lovely, isn't it?
thank you, anne.

## aren't you going to open it?
come on, show us what it is.

## what?
it's not new.

## what for?
look at his upper lip.

## he wants to get rid of that?
put some milk on it and let the cat lick it off.

## you think you're funny, don't you?
look, he can't wait.

## something for me?
capsules.

## what's the matter with you?
get them out.

## lsn't she cute?
get that cat out of here.

## he's not going and the cat's not going.
cat?

## what's wrong with you?
someone go and make father come back.

## haven't you done enough?
please, mr. van daan.

## please, will you keep still?
i think he will.

## a few moments ago, we thought they had come for us, didn't we?
we thought it was the end.

## how about the song?
happy hannukah.

## what is it?
mr. kraler.

## feeling any better?
i'm all right.

## it's beautiful, isn't it?
it's ages since i've even seen a cake.

## remember?
it had \"peace in 1 943 \"written on it.

## ... how many of us are there?
none for me.

## why wouldn't she?
i think it won't harm her.

## what do you mean?
well, mrs. frank divides things better.

## just what are you trying to say?
forget it, we're wasting time.

## don't l?
forget it.

## don't l?
yes, yes, yes.

## you see, miep, what a little sugar cake does to us?
it goes right to our heads.

## you're sure you won't have any?
very sure.

## do you think that you could?
i'm afraid with him gone a week, peter....

## what are you going to do?
no.

## what is wrong?
father is going to sell her fur coat.

## it's mine, you hear me?
it's none of your darn business.

## so if you please, sell it for us?
it should fetch a good price.

## and by the way...... would you get me cigarettes?
i don't care what kind, get all you can.

## what's happened?
if it is something that concerns us here, we'd better all hear it.

## what do you hear from your friend mr. frank?
i said there's a rumor you were in switzerland.

## was not there a door here leading to the loft?
then he asked me for more money.

## 20 guilders?
very modest blackmail.

## you know what i think?
he's the thief who was down there that night.

## what did you tell him?
i told him i had to think about it.

## take a chance on firing him, or what?
i do not know.

## what are they paying nowadays?
he could get it in a war plant.

## we've got to pay, haven't we?
whatever he asks, we've got to pay.

## what does that mean, the telephone ringing on a holiday?
that's my wife.

## she talks as if we started the war.
what's the good of that?

## did we start the war?
you left this.

## isn't it funny, you and l?
here we've been together all this time...... and this is the first time we've ever really talked.

## it helps a lot to have someone to talk to, doesn't it?
it helps you let off steam.

## i said it, didn't l?
good night.

## may i come in?
no, i'm not dressed yet.

## tell me, am i terribly ugly?
oh, stop fishing.

## may i come in?
come in, mother.

## you're not going in again tonight to see peter?
that is my intention.

## aren't you afraid you're disturbing him?
mother, i have some intuition.

## then may i ask this much, annie?
don't shut the door when you go in.

## talk?
that's not what they called it when i was a girl.

## why?
i mean, every time i go into peter's room...... i have the feeling that i'm hurting you.

## will you please let me in my room?
just a minute, dear mr. dussel.

## do you mind?
peter, i do not want you staying up till all hours tonight.

## aren't you, annie?
yes, mother.

## may we go now?
listen for the chimes, dear.

## aren't they impossible?
treating us as if we're still in the nursery.

## already i know what i want to do, don't you?
i want to be a journalist or something.

## what do you want to do?
i know what i'd like right now.

## you like margot, don't you?
right from the start, you liked her.

## i have?
i used to think that you were awful noisy.

## how have i changed?
well...... you're quieter.

## now, what did i ever see in that miss quack quack?
i haven't got any friends.

## does that mean you can get along without me too?
i think of myself as your friend.

## peter...... did you ever kiss a girl?
yes.

## the girl you kissed?
i don't know.

## i don't suppose that really counts, does it?
it didn't with me.

## you wouldn't say those counted, would you?
i wouldn't say so.

## do you think a girl shouldn't kiss anyone except if she's engaged or something?
it's so hard to try to think what to do.

## what do you think?
i suppose it depends on the girl.

## you won't let them stop you from coming?
no.

## what kind of things?
well...... i wouldn't want you to see some of it.

## did you change your mind?
mr. van daan.

## mr. van daan, how could you?
i'm hungry.

## what do you mean?
just that.

## mr. van daan, i know this is never going to happen again, is it?
no, no.

## mrs. frank, you would put us out on the street?
you can find another hiding place.

## a closet?
mr. frank...

## see what he's doing?
\"i'm standing by...... to bring news of the invasion.

## but it is mr. kraler.
did you hear?

## isn't it wonderful?
when the nurse told me the news...... i said, \"there's only one place to be, with my friends.

## mr. van daan.
putti, what is it?

## didn't you hear?
we are going to be liberated.

## who knows?
i may be back in school by fall.

## i can shake off everything if i write, but...... and that is the great question, will i ever be able to write well?
i want to so much.

## mr. frank, do you hear?
yes, i hear.

## you with the diary there, what day is it?
i don't lose track of the days.

## whose fault is it we're here?
we could've been safe in america or switzerland.

## aren't the clouds beautiful?
what a lovely, lovely day.

## you know what i do...... when i think i can't stand another minute of being cooped up?
i think myself outside.

## you know...... the most wonderful part of thinking yourself outside?
you can have it any way you like.

## isn't that wonderful?
when i was outside, i used to take it all for granted.

## but you know what i sometimes think?
i think the world may be going through a phase...... the way i was with mother.

## goodbye for a while.
isn't it lovely?

## each time the train would stop...... we'd all get out at a siding or a crossing...... and walk from group to group.
p. s., please, please, anyone...... if you should find this diary, will you please keep it safe for me?

## my daughter?
that's how i found out about my wife's death.

## has general dobrinsky arrived?
yes, general.

## you've seen the election results?
bad news for us.

## remember dimitrov's speech to the 6th congress of the international?
the masses in the democracies aren't ready to rise up.

## you're sure?
i'm more than positive.

## so i needn't fear too much unrest in my factory?
trust him.

## won't you come in?
the concierge gave me this by mistake.

## very pretty.
mr voronin?

## which market is it?
it doesn't exist.

## so, dearie... what's that lady doing?
she's shopping.

## and this one?
she's the stallholder.

## what's your name?
we call her dani.

## i hardly dare ask you... could i paint her?
she might not feel comfortable here.

## could you come upstairs?
gladly.

## can i say that?
we'd probably say \"in their natural habitat.

## are you russian?
not me.

## is she being good?
good as gold.

## fernande?
the girl from upstairs.

## do you like it?
guess what she does.

## ancient greek?
her french pronunciation baffles me.

## did you meet the husband?
he was at a meeting.

## who says?
i saw him in the street reading i'humanite.

## that he's communist?
bear it in mind.

## did she ask you about me?
come to think of it, yes.

## shouldn't i?
i don't hide it.

## he's a teacher too?
history.

## are you spying on them?
this is for you.

## how can we thank you?
let me use the spare sketches for another painting.

## a painting of what?
i don't know yet.

## why not?
but i doubt it's your kind of painting.

## you know her?
but i can read russian.

## not your taste?
it's not that.

## is your art for yourself or to sell?
i've sold some to friends, but even that is hard.

## have you met?
fyodor, our new neighbours, mr and mme passard.

## aren't they russian?
i've heard of them but they left russia.

## did you visit?
yes.

## spy on what?
every red in france and russia must have a file on fyodor.

## which one shall i take?
i don't know... that's far too much.

## see?
i was right.

## says who?
this is no time to take power.

## how do you know?
believe me.

## what do i think?
my party has no hand in them.

## but do you approve?
that's beside the point.

## an embarrassing fact?
like any unforeseen event, but politicians have to adapt.

## but as a citizen yourself, don't you have a gut reaction?
of course.

## no hostility?
no true communist opposes the will of the oppressed.

## why do you communists oppose revolution?
we oppose an abortive revolution that would surely end in repression, snuffing out the fresh hope lit by the popular front.

## petit bourgeois, catholics... orthodox?
and protestants, of course, muslims in the colonies... even white russians.

## even generals?
yes, now they've disarmed.

## forgive me, but did you serve as a general?
in the civil war.

## a general at 20?
that beats napoleon.

## you know what dimitrov said last year?
to us, the white army is like a flea jumping 1, 000 miles from an elephant.

## have you spotted dani?
it's typically her, pensive among playing children.

## you know that word?
in greek, esostrephis.

## him?
he's very discreet.

## send me a postcard?
yes, i work as a taxi driver.

## can't you take me on the white army staff?
i'm afraid not.

## have you gone communist?
i live in a communist country, or almost.

## in what way?
by flushing out nostalgic and revanchist sentiments.

## what can we do?
but don't worry, i still think communism's a utopia, bound to collapse from within.

## do you swallow what they say?
the thing is, they don't actually say it.

## you fell for it?
it's a fake, planted by ultra militarists and corvignolles agents.

## heard of it?
you seem well informed.

## who told you?
i never name my sources.

## and how do you know i'm not a cagoule member?
if you were, you wouldn't say.

## i pull strings.
don't you believe me?

## i know what you mean, but how?
that... is a trade secret.

## what is it?
no, nothing.

## what things?
for example, you wouldn't attend that conference in spain.

## didn't i tell you?
perhaps not.

## so you have no state secrets?
some.

## i have to learn about them second hand.
but as for the other... non secrets?

## such as?
your refusal to go to spain.

## everything i can?
no, fedya.

## the one thing that bothers me about you and could slightly put me off you is the way you try to justify your... reticence?
i think that's the word.

## you know that word?
of course.

## how can i put it more plainly?
i'm sworn to secrecy.

## you should take some precautions.
april why close it?

## what did the doctor say?
i'm better, but still fragile and prone to infection.

## did he give you a tonic?
he says ideally we'd live in the country.

## the suburbs?
they're either lower class and grim or expensive.

## for us?
fine.

## but i'm not sure we can accept.
so?

## like it?
of course, but... no buts.

## i love how you've arranged the furniture.
never leave a house empty, right?

## don't you feel cut off and bored?
people will visit us.

## when?
some time ago.

## i don't see... you're sure it was berlin?
my brother in law lgor saw him.

## yes, but did he speak to him?
he saw him through a cafe window.

## what do you mean?
i didn't want to say it, but you should be prepared for certain rumours.

## what rumours?
some official building with an endless german name.

## june arsinoe, have you seen my bag?
there it is.

## like in november?
yes, to brussels.

## and then?
then i'il come home.

## who said that?
only dobrinsky and i knew.

## which one?
she doesn't know.

## is that all?
i think not.

## you think i'm delirious?
hardly.

## will you forgive me?
i was only half listening.

## who'd know that i knew?
it would get around.

## who would be asking me?
anyone.

## see?
it's clear.

## don't you agree?
yes, i believe you.

## does your husband?
he thinks... well, i don't know.

## do you really disagree?
sorry.

## you think the charges were all trumped up?
of course.

## so stalin's a dove?
just now, yes.

## are you sure?
positive.

## so why are the french communists so violently against pacifists such as emery and bergery?
because the views from paris and moscow are different.

## so why's he sending volunteers and aircraft to spain?
first, because the fascists and nazis went in first.

## why?
to hide what he's up to.

## i'm sure you'il love it.
which is?

## what's it called?
exactly.

## aren't you hungry?
not very.

## you're not suggesting we go to america?
no, another country.

## not germany?
no, russia.

## why would they take me?
i'il go with you.

## what is this wild idea?
not so wild.

## would you want me to?
i'm deadly serious.

## told what?
specific things that will soon be more specific.

## you don't think i'd fight for mr hitler, do you?
i don't like the germans.

## what did i refuse to tell him?
presumably, the germans were keen to compromise the red army chief, knowing stalin was down on him.

## are you crying?
i'm not crying.

## isn't it all too good to be true?
maybe i'm gullible too, but... i'il risk it.

## you're smiling?
you don't have to believe me.

## you see?
my remark about the purges wasn't a tasteless joke.

## the only thing that could stop me accepting is... yes?
yes, it's you.

## sound good?
i don't know.

## the real risk to your health and others, more nebulous but very possible?
i'm a fly in the ointment.

## and for wednesday's cocktail party?
i've got nothing.

## would you mind?
i have shopping to do and people to see.

## rightist provocation?
too far fetched.

## what do you think, general?
nothing.

## do you have a hunch?
none.

## does it hurt when i press?
it's deeper.

## my dress isn't ready?
you said late morning.

## so, is the dress ready?
i'm still waiting.

## how about some shoes?
i like these.

## won't dobrinsky be there?
no, i doubt it.

## may we pay our respects to general dobrinsky?
i'm afraid he may not be able to come and even if he does, it won't be before 8.

## will it take long?
we'il just look in.

## ready to go home?
yes, if you don't mind.

## what's up?
i think i've got myself into a mess.

## when?
this afternoon.

## what could you have done?
i shouldn't be telling you, but... i'm afraid you might be questioned unprepared.

## questioned about what?
how we spent the day.

## unfortunately... what is it?
i'm afraid dobrinsky's disappeared.

## what do you mean?
plain disappeared.

## wasn't he at home?
no, but he was out late, anyway.

## so?
i'm afraid he's been kidnapped.

## how do you know?
we didn't see him all day.

## where?
near here.

## like kutyepov?
exactly.

## who was in the car?
two germans.

## do you swear?
i swear.

## on your son's life?
on principle.

## while you waited for your dress, did anyone enter the room?
no, from the moment you left until you returned.

## but what?
i don't fully understand.

## as he pretends to lean over to open the near door, the car roars off down the empty street.
why should i have needed one?

## didn't i tell you?
the agent of a right wing anti nazi german industrialist was to leave it on a bench.

## all done in what, five minutes?
ten at the most.

## where did he come from?
strictly speaking, he wasn't a fake.

## what would the russians gain?
i can't see that either.

## anyone can lose to a beginner.
do another kutyepov?

## like me, remember?
but they're not beginners.

## what threat could poor dobrinsky pose?
then maybe it wasn't a kidnapping.

## but why, for god's sake?
it makes no sense.

## parade him in russia, saying he retired to the soviet paradise?
he'd never say it, even under torture.

## as grotesque as the kidnapping itself.
replace him with a lookalike?

## do you think i'd lend myself to such a farrago?
i understand you.

## is it me they want to compromise?
i know things they wish i didn't.

## who do i mean by \"they\"?
tchernov.

## piotr pavlovitch, what's going on?
sorry to bother you.

## what do you mean?
he didn't come home.

## are they suspicious?
no, but... i'm his deputy.

## we're sorry to get you up in the dead of night, but do you know where general dobrinsky is?
i've no idea.

## when did he tell you that?
yesterday.

## you haven't seen him today?
not today.

## at one o'clock?
at one, i was with my wife at her dressmaker's.

## i am leaving this note, just in case.
i repeat, did you arrange to meet him at 1:00 at la muette metro station?

## do you recognize his handwriting?
i think it's a forgery.

## see?
it can't be dobrinsky.

## you saw how he flinched when you said one o'clock?
keep a close eye on him.

## where's voronin?
he just left.

## why is there no light?
strange.

## is that you?
captain tchernov.

## is he back?
we're looking for him.

## even at 1 p. m.?
i was at my dressmaker's.

## see these marks?
they show the location of... the microphones.

## will you follow me downstairs?
semenov confessed.

## remember the voronin case?
the spy who kidnapped gen.

## you think he hid here?
most probably.

## see?
it cuts off the electricity in the stairs.

## is she still in prison?
no, she died.

## be a sport, will ya?
i missed ruthie's birthday dinner last night and she's makin 'my life hell in a handbasket.

## what the hell is this?
it's a russian pomeranian, larry.

## if you're busting your ass, how come it's the size of a goddamn beanbag chair?
if you put out once in a while, maybe i wouldn't be seeking carnal pleasure in food.

## are you having sex?
i think she's saying she's a whore, pop.

## how come you don't have a girlfriend?
she's just repeating what you said.

## you mean a hit man?
no, man.

## you like it?
i just got it cut..... by the most beautiful woman on the face of god's green earth.

## who the hell cares?
i tell you, she's well worth the price of a hat.

## who's next?
uh, right here.

## so how do you like it?
oh, you know, just...

## so you want it shorter, then?
yeah, shorter.

## so you cut a lot of hair?
i guess so.

## uh, where are you from?
i'm sorry.

## what did you say your name was?
actually, i didn't.

## how's that for length?

## ringo?
that must be a pretty popular name for a cat these days.

## it is?
no, but they tell me i'm first in line for an ear donor.

## what are you doin 'tonight?
just healin ', mostly.

## okay?
mrs. devereaux, i'm back.

## where's the record?
it was right here.

## mrs. devereaux, could you come here for a second?
caroline, i was beginning to worry about you... you were gone such a long while.

## yeah, i was wondering if you could take a look at this?
there's a leak up here.

## you want this for the sill?
all right.

## could you come into the room please, just for a second?
so i can show you what i'm seeing.

## after you've given mr. devereaux his remedies... would you be so kind as to join an old lady for supper?

## how's your gumbo?
i haven't started.

## would you like sugar for your tea?
i put it out for you.

## you think i'm senile, don't you?

## these ghosts, why would they put a spell on him and not me?
i've been in that room, too.

## so, was that the storm or the ghosts?
well, say what you will about spirits.

## like a spell?
i have great respect for your husband.

## what did happen to him, violet?
you haven't touched your gumbo.

## what have you done to him?
i made that special for you, and you haven't even touched it.

## what, what...
what have you done?

## what is this?
you've done something.

## where's the record?
oh, god.

## i won't leave you.
caroline?

## you think you're stronger than me?
you can't get away, caroline.

## you understand me?
you'il never get out of here, child.

## you didn't leave anyone.
caroline?

## okay?
slow down.

## she tried to kill you?

three years.

## what was wrong with me the first day?
here you go.

## does it hurt?

## he was your pimp?
a bastard from the first day i met him.

no, i think it was the show.

## you ever have a pimp?
no, i didn't need one.

no.

## even with you being a dyke?
he paid me to kiss you.

it's not a work night.

## i'm going to say, \"i need a long island iced tea for my john back there\"... and that's going to be okay?

velvet's looking for you.

yeah, she did, and i told her she could have your room.

## can't she, please?
i'm supposed to keep this place safe for you.

## besides, how would i explain this to david?
don't tell him about it, that's how.

## you don't think other david called him as soon as he got out of here last night?
i can pretty much guarantee you that didn't happen.

## you mean like when my husband died... and he left me and ray all alone with no money and no life insurance?
yeah, i'm familiar with that feeling.

## so this is your room then?
yeah.

## it's the accessories that really make the difference, don't you think?
please don't make fun of me.

## i'm sorry?
i don't think i'm making my husband happy anymore.

## you mean as opposed to, like, asking for my special recipe for meatloaf?
i'm sorry, i had no business.

oh, uh.

## have you seen david this morning?
yeah.

## where is he?
i don't know.

## huh?
it's charles.

## but why don't i go ahead and call you al?
i've been working here for two years, and you don't even know my first name.

## give a girl a break.
am i supposed to be scared?

## lee harvey oswald, james earl ray, john wilkes booth.
where was i?

## what do they all have in common, al?
two things.

## simple.
you sure i don't have the balls, i'm a loser and i don't have what it takes?

i'il blow all your fucking heads off right here.

## ready?
together.

## so he never came home from the motel after the last night, right?
yes, um...

## was he drinking or...?
no.

## call us if you need anything, okay?
he saved the life of a fellow bank employee.

## when are you gonna quit bitching?
two years you've been busting my balls on every detail of this plan.

## you know what?
i've had enough of your shit too.

## why don't you put it in my bank review?
oh, well, maybe i will.

## why didn't you use blanks?
that's what i told him.

## hey, jack?
yes, eric.

## uh, chicken, are you still breathing?
not anymore.

## why did you kill him?
it was part of the plan.

## oh, god, you were feigning, weren't you?
i'm sorry, i didn't know.

## oh, that?
oh, thanks, that was a gift.

## so where are you headed, miss thang?
oh, well, uh... my office is still closed today so i thought i would go over there and stash my winnings.

## you take care of yourself, okay?
i will.

## and jack, will you keep an eye on him for me?
i will.

## you believe me?

## what... how can you walk away from a woman like that?
easily.

## something wrong?
we did it.

## i'm sorry about that, right?
yeah.

## no big speech about how you didn't see this coming?
you burned me.

## how much do you think housekeeping gets to clean a room like this?
well, not enough, that's for sure.

## can you imagine the look on the maid's face when she comes in here and finds all you guys dead?
i guess i should be disappointed with the way things turned out.

## but what're you gonna do?
if you want to play the game and someone plays it better than you, you've got to give it up to them.

## the bad news?
i had to take a bullet in the brain to get it.

## as for fate and cosmic justice?
well, maybe in the end we do get exactly what we deserve.

## believe me?
i believe you.

## who cares if it's cloudy or sunny?
i want to show you something real quick.

## could you throw another tray of brie puffs in the oven?

a lie.

## would you like a martini?
that sounds great.

## what is it, jiggs?
you have something on your mind.

## well, hasn't your mother ever told you about marines?
well, i know all about this marine.

## what do you want?
well, you invited me.

## remember?
a rain check handed out the night of the party.

## or should we fall back on the familiar item of conversation, gentleman jim scott?
well, this must come as a shock to you, but i lock up the office now and then.

## you want to scream?
that's a rather unfair question.

## would you like another martini?
perhaps we should talk about...

## hey, how about dinner someplace?
you might even talk me into wheeling you around a dance floor.

## did you know that i'm a swinging cook?
sounds like i've got myself a good deal.

## and it's in writing?
thank god.

## now when can you get back?
trans ocean, flight 42 out of madrid.

## why does a girl keep a photograph of a man she doesn't even remember?
i can't imagine.

## no symptoms remaining?
none that i'm aware of.

## does that prove anything to you?
i'm sorry, ellie.

## we go from here, all right?
sure.

## but do you know what does cut?
the fact that he sent you.

## did i step on your old school tie?
you're just like a lot of civilians.

## any effects?
the wreckage was strewn out for a couple of miles.

## what?
about his being away.

## where in god's name is he?
now look here, prentice.

## why don't you have yourself a drink and finish your dinner?
yes, i'm from the embassy.

## senator clark?
yeah.

## mutt, isn't it?
that's what they call me.

## how do you know jiggs?
he has been up before our committee a number of times...... and he's done some favors for me on occasion.

## those part of your orders, colonel?
i don't understand.

## to get me snoggered?
no, sir.

## i don't know what you're saying.
doesn't that seem a little odd to you?

## would you sit down and hear me out?
i guess so.

## do you trust jiggs casey?
you name it, he can have it, sir.

## if he told you something, would you believe him?
i would, indeed.

## how did you know about my seeing jiggs on monday?
he told me.

## ma'am, did you see a real tall soldier with a funny hat waiting right here?
no.

## could your men have been mistaken, art?
not a chance, sir.

## mr. president, what are you waiting for?
fire scott, hardesty, dieffenbach, riley.

## and then where do i stand?
a lunatic.

## would you allow me to strike that last idiotic remark?
there's no need, jordie.

## and that is?
to use these letters that casey got from the girl.

## what did you tell him?
i told him it was classified and to forget it.

## the next step should be to your liking, chris.
do you understand that?

## now it's a general scott.
esther?

## i beg your pardon, mr. president.
yes?

## you wish the alert cancelled?
i do.

## may i ask why?
certain facts have come to my attention.

## and the name of the unit?
you know that unit.

## what was the date of that meeting, general?
i can't recall exactly, but it was right here in this office.

## you have a record of the date and subject?
certainly, mr. president, in my office.

## that would be?
that would be senator raymond clark, the senior senator from georgia.

## would you like them in chronological order?
i never discuss politics with my officers, but i do demand the highest competence.

## what was he doing on a motor boat cruising around my island at blue lake?
don't tell me that's my imagination because i've got him on film.

## what about the kidnapping and detention of colonel henderson at the airport today?
i know about that case.

## and that would be general james mattoon scott, wouldn't it?
i don't know whether to laugh at such megalomania, or simply cry.

## why in god's name don't you have faith...... in the system of government you're so hell bent to protect?
you say i've duped the people.

## you accuse me of having lost their faith...... and deliberately and criminally shut my ears to the national voice?
i do.

## how did that voice seep into a locked room full of conspirators?
that's not where you hear the voice of the people.

## you want to defend the united states of america?
then defend it with the tools it supplies you with, it's constitution.

## are you honest to god serious?
and what's more, you know it, i know it, and the country knows it.

## possibly even attack us?
i think perhaps a question of days, perhaps hours...... certainly weeks.

## will you resign, general?
i will not resign.

## anything else...... mr. president?
i've called a press conference for tomorrow.

## are you sure that he won't use this press conference to make any accusations?
he'il use this press conference to support a position that is totally indefensible.

## are you sufficiently up on your bible to know who judas was?
i suggest you read that letter, sir.

## are you ordering me to answer, sir?
i am.

## you got my speech, didn't you?
yes, but when this came out minutes ago, the five network vice presidents called me.

## do i get on the air or don't i?
we've gone along with you all the way, but for god's sake, we're in jeopardy now.

## harold?
general, it's out of my hands now.

## what will you do?
go to mount thunder and cut in on the television networks.

## sir?
take me home.

## were those the bullets?
they might have been, but they weren't.

## another rain check?
tuck it somewhere safe, where you won't forget.

## hey, how can i help you?
good morning.

## and this one goes... where?
v ery well.

## what did you find?
yes.

## another statue, huh?
fine.

## uncle?
just sign the new draft of your will.

## now tell me, what did our buyer have to say to you?
oh... same old thing.

## so what are you waiting for?
no, not this time.

## are you looking for anything in particular?
pricey.

## no?
yes.

## may i ask your opinion about something?
sure.

## do you like this one?
no.

## how about this one?
no.

## this one?
that one.

## which one?
that one.

## yes?
thank you very much.

## a toy?

## where did you say you fell?
over some broken glass.

## remember when aunt marge died?
everyone was soaked in blood and she was spotless.

## what is it?
i don't know, some sort of metal shaving.

## do you like it?
no.

## you don't eat breakfast?
i'm not hungry.

## hey, do you like it or not?
yes, i do like it.

## how are you?

christ walked on water, just like a mosquito.

just by accident.

## mr. gris?
you may continue the game.

## aurora?
i know you've got it.

## are you comfortable back there?
it already happened to me once, with your dad.

## you remember him, at least a little?
yes...

## jesus?
just a minute.

## a god?
you're so good to me.

## lf i remember?
i always think about the first time i saw you, how i thought you would never pay attention to me.

## how are they supported?
the fact is that the pillars...

## teacher, can you see...?
ln a minute, manuel.

## ls something wrong?
no, i'il be right back.

## where are you going?
i'il get something to drink.

## ls it better?
yeah.

## is that possible?
yeah.

## will it accept the input... so we can transmit a completed signal back to the face?
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

## i mean, what if you're wrong?
three people have already died over that thing.

i'm not sure.

## guys, i don't know what the hell wejust did, but does that look to you like a hostile gesture?
no.

## phil, do you read?
yeah, jim.

## copy?
copy that.

## jim, you sure you want to do this?
i'm not sure about anything any more.

## is anyone there?
over.

## we're millions of miles from earth inside a giant white face.
jim, whatare you doing?

## what's impossible?
there's 12 p. s. i. in here.

## is that what i think it is?
yeah.

## anyone?
e. r. v. to rover.

## does anyone copy?
e. r. v. torover.

## phil?
oh, thank god.

you're quite mistaken, baron.

## what's he doing?
he's completing his experiments.

## would you tell me that?
if you please, herr baron, the burgomaster.

## well, what do you want?
if it's trouble, go away.

## what do you mean, \"no trouble\"?
there's nothing but trouble.

## yes, yes, yes, we know all about that, but what do you want?
what i really want to know is when will the wedding be, if you please.

## what about his work?
stuff and nonsense.

## what about his wedding?
there is another woman... and i'm going to find her.

## do you expect perfection at once?
this creature of yours should be kept under guard.

## dangerous?
poor old waldman.

## and what changes the darkness into light?
but if you talk like that... people call you crazy.

## my father?
it understands.

## come, pull yourself together.
what's that?

## what can we do?
kill it, as you would any savage animal.

## got it?
yes, here it is.

## ready?
no, i'm all right.

## what's happening?
elizabeth and your father are coming to see you.

## is that the front door?

i'm so glad you're safe.

## are you sure?
maria.

## why do you bring her here to me?
but...

## how is elizabeth now?
i don't know.

## a day?
i wonder.

## what do you mean?
there can be no wedding while this horrible creation of mine is still alive.

## you understand?
come on, hurry.

## what's this?
if you please, herr baron, we thought that mr henry could do with a glass of his great grandmother's wine.

## it is true, grendpa '.
really?

## how do you know?
last time i missed audition because of them.

## where?
inside.

## what if somebody see me taking passengers out of bus stop and report me?
come on, get down.

## you want a ticket?
go on, misko.

## what do you think why i have escaped from the house, now, when we are married?
i want to see the sea.

## i go.
why haven't you said it before?

## daddy, when we arrive in belgrade, will we go to the zoo again?
off course, misko.

## what is it now?
this is no bus stop.

## excuse me, if it is no secret, what kind of rocks do you collect?
coloured and sparkling.

## excuse me, where do you take it?
to a scientist.

## have you driven 2 km with tied eyes, ha?
i don't like when people are making up.

## can you see anything?
no, i don't... all right, i was kidding.

## i am terribly thirsty.
what do you want now:should we go around or should we go back?

## can i have a little from that water?
this water is not for drinking.

## want some brandy?
thanks, i can't, my stomach...

## how do you mean?
100 dinars.

## daddy, what is it?
it's this:people ask that we pay for crossing collect the money anyway you can.

## how much?
200 dinars.

## why in god's name have you ploughed this road, ha?
the teacher.

## what happened, in god's name?
scoundrels... they killed my uncle.

## we have paid, what more do you want!?
i would be exceptionally glad if you heard me consider yourself invited.

## child knows nothing.
where is your father?

## from whom?
from us.

## we came to look them...?
doesn't matter...

## love you as a woman...
listen, what do you need that kid for?

## where are you going with him?
life flies away quickly...

## which road did you use?

## why do you scare this people?
come on, they have overrun half europe, us they will leave for seeds.

## where are you going?
to belgrade.

## it seems you are escaping?

## you are glad that they have recruited him, ha?
yes i am.

i don't worry, when they hear me they will take me even without it.

## listen, in which division is your son?
artillery, like yours.

## where was it?
here, in the pocket.

## and now is most commonly associated with linux and the open source movement.
and he looked back to me and said, \"oh, yeah and what do you do?

## what is linux?
i see that you've chosen the password mumble, whatever it was.

## a hobby computer is wasted.
how did that begin?

## will quality software be written for the hobby market?
as the majority of hobbyists must be aware, most of you steal your software.

## one thing you do do is prevent good software from being written.
who cares if the people who worked on it get paid?

## what hobbyist can put 3 man years into programming, finding all bugs, documenting his product and distribute it for free?
the fact is, no one besides us has invested a lot of money in hobby software.

## aren't they making money on hobby software?
yes, but those who have been reported to us may lose in the end.

## and that put me into a moral dilemma, you see?
because to get one of the modern computers of the day, which was the early 80's, you would have to get a proprietory operating system.

## lin us \"or \"line us\"?
well, you can judge.

## and most of them don't know it.
right?

## well, if i install linux.
i mean what's your thought on that?

## it does what webmasters actually need and the combination of apache and linux found its way into a great many commercial shops.
i get some tangible benefit from doing so, right?

## how do we sell products in this environment?
then i looked at the competition, particularly microsoft.

## was there some way they could use our source code against us?
and that's why i included a reference to eric's paper in my paper.

## but i was very very open with him.
any chairs around here?

## the more i told him, the more he started to shake his head like this, and i finally said, you know, \"what's wrong?
but some people said \"yeah, that was our debutante ball.

## you didn't buy?
no, no, i didn't buy.

## to the freedom they can have, or not have, when they use a computer.
you guys don't know?

## well what can we do about it?
somewhat modified of course.

## and we kept asking them, well \"hows it going?
are things going ok?\".

## come on.
mommy?

## i'm trying.
what's going on?

## where are you taking us?
lnto that car.

## what was going on in that garage?

i'd find a better place than that.

## how have you been?
it's kidokoro.

## that man was my father?
you wouldn't remember.

## you know why people thought that way then?

heavens, santos.

because i gave you that citation...... i lost my post as secretary.

you'il be buried in a white urn, you're so naive.

## you're not aware that carmelito was murdered?
murdered.

## isn't a stab in the back or a bullet wound...... natural death in these parts?
his brother manuel, who was transporting the feathers...... to san fernando with him, is a suspect.

## could it truly have been his own brother?
two sacks of feathers are worth a lot of money.

## did manuel take the feathers?
who knows.

## don't you know i have a ghostly partner...... who reveals to me everything of my interest?
and, by the way...... i'm going to ask him what you've been up to...... the past few days you were gone.

## do you have a new sweetheart?
i'm going to get jealous.

## what are you saying?
i'm going to find out where those feathers are.

## killing time?
in light of lack of food.

## what if he doesn't want to come?
by his own feet.

## are you insane, mr. guillermo?
selling feathers is dangerous business right now.

## have you passed by totuma's grove lately?
not exactly by the grove, no.

## what?
i did.

## what?
it has your initials on it.

## what do you intend?
i don't intend anything.

## don't you realize, mr. guillermo?
not as dangerous as offering feathers.

## you understand?
the good name returns to the palm grove.

## for me?
i was sent to fetch you, and i must take you with me.

## dead or alive?
that is up to you.

## what were you doing here?
i came from altamira to tell you the news.

## is he dead?
dead as a rock, doctor.

## what will we do with him?
don't be appalled...... at the murderer's red glory.

take him home.

## things are starting to go the right way.
who's going?

## really?
as i arrived i was told...... that melquiades was killed...... and i just heard the confession by the murderer.

## how about that?
i think you are mistaken, mr. guillermo.

## did he finally die?
this afternoon.

## am i not right in saying things are taking the right path?
once the father is dead...... parental authority over marisela...... is completely in your hands.

## marisela?
yes.

## you didn't hear anything, is that clear?
melquiades never liked balbino paiba.

## but...... what if balbino can prove it wasn't him?
he can't.

## are you going to save luzardo...... when you could get rid of him...... by simply leaving him to his own means?
yes.

## yes, ma'am?
my horse.

## where are you going?
only god knows.

## what are you waiting for?
i'il be damned.

## what do they want now?

## what if i get a black eye?
five rings, padre.

## padre, what if zorro comes?

a landslide in favor of statehood.

## let's hope the rest of california voted the same, huh?
they were held up, governor.

## yes?
the federal marshals may need help keeping things under control until then.

## i'm overreacting?
you made a promise.

## oh, really?
really.

that's an easy one.

## hoofer?
so i have a bad memory.

## what does that prove?
that you do not know your own son.

## order servants around all day?
no, no, don't twist my words.

## you remember what you said the day joaquin was born?
my family is my life.

for 10 years, you have fought to give california its freedom.

## why can't you give us ours?
they are calling you.

## what happened to the woman who used to fight by my side?
she had a son.

## why wasn't papi at breakfast?
i told you.

## what exactly does he do?
well, he is a don.

## we can talk more about this later, all right?
i love you.

## what do you want?
your help.

## one?
i tell you, de la vega, women say they want one thing...... but what they really want is everything else.

## isn't it possible our wives marry us...... because they want to spend some time with their husbands?
so let me understand this.

## if i take your advice...... i can look forward to spending my days pruning in a tub of naked men?
thanks for the advice.

## where are you going?
to beg elena's forgiveness.

## might one of you be don alejandro de la vega?
yes.

## what's today?
wednesday.

## what happened to my clothes?
i removed them last night so you wouldn't catch pneumonia.

## you removed them?
after you came back from the cantina, you went for a swim.

## in my clothes?
this hotel doesn't have a pool.

## perhaps you just can turn around, eh?
i'il see you at confession, my child.

## who said my spirit needed lifting?
alejandro, you are being a pig headed fool.

## you'd blackmail my soul, eh?
hell, yes.

## now...... would anyone else like to interrupt my lecture...... by asking to go to the bathroom?
no.

## no more exploitation of the peasants by the rich...... who oppress us with a flaming poker of injustice.
who can tell me what this word means?

## and how exactly does a flaming poker fit into your little theory?
it fits...... in your butt.

## joaquin.
no?

## so, what's with you, huh?
you're lucky father quintero didn't throw you out for good.

## why do you keep picking fights?
you don't understand.

## says who?
says him.

## how do you know what he'd say?
trust me, i know him a lot better than you think.

## understand?
don alejandro.

## have we met before, sir?
i would remember a man with wooden teeth.

## or is he gonna cluck?
leave him out of...

## is everything all right, boys?
respects to you, officer.

## what the...?
i need at least one vice to keep in touch with sinners.

## who owns this vineyard anyway?
a count recently in from france.

## french count, you say?
he's probably still in his parlor putting on makeup.

## and you are...?
de la vega.

## from whom?
you know, i'd love to continue this conversation...... but i'm wanted elsewhere.

## come on, let's go.
and who might that be?

## go?
i don't wanna go.

## you know each other?
we shared a giggle at the buffet table.

## what brings you here, colonel?
the threat of civil war, my dear.

## shall we dance?
of course.

## and leave your guests?
in a heartbeat.

## since when did you start caring what i think?
oh, it's rather common, actually.

## is there anything i can say to make you leave?
you can fall to your knees and beg me to take you back.

## who's looking after joaquin while his mother spends her nights out?
i have not spent my nights out.

## count armand...... with his fancy wine and the froufrou accent.
could you...?

## how could elena choose a man like that?
i'il make her want me back so badly, she will be weeping with desire.

## why not dine at your hacienda?
i'd really like to meet your son.

## what is it?
oh, this hat.

## a pipe?
a pipe.

## when did you start smoking a pipe?
i don't smoke.

## yes, what are you talking about?
an explosion.

## doesn't everyone?
i suggest we play as they do in slovenia.

## may i offer you something to drink?
double tequila, no salt.

## or you just resting?
you know, i think i like this game.

## what makes you think i will lose?
woman's intuition.

## what do you really know about this man?
we were never meant to be together.

## master, a word?
please, excuse me a moment.

## and what is through that door?
private chapel.

## where is the bathroom?
i would like to powder my cheeks.

## now that we have the deed, will the track be completed on time?
it'il take my boys two days to cover the quarter mile.

## understood?
elena, i was right.

## what?
armand needed his land to build a railroad.

## how do you know this?
there you are.

## are you all right?
fine.

## is that a yes?
take out your notebooks...

## is there something i can help you with, seor?
don't let me interrupt the lesson, father.

## grab that there, will you?
looking at two of the ugliest guys i've ever seen.

## you're really zorro.
do you want a piece of me?

## and that's tornado, right?
i mean, whoa.

## so you gonna say something or what?
let's speak in spanish, the language of our fathers.

## why not?
i'm the one asking the questions.

## now, why aren't you in school?
the man with the scar on his face.

## that's all there was?
lots and lots of it.

## would i lie to you?
spanish, nio, spanish, and this isn't a game.

## how do you know?
i know.

## are you sure that this is the symbol you saw on the crate?
orbis unum. \"yeah.

## armand is a knight?
some believe they are the masters behind all the kings in europe...... even today.

## with the soap?
thank you.

## it does?
some colleagues of mine are arriving from europe this evening.

## perhaps we could meet for breakfast?
i cannot wait that long.

## who are you?
i'm agent pike.

## so you are the good guys?
we live in perilous times, mr. de la vega.

## as a spy?
until california's statehood becomes official...... we don't have jurisdiction to serve armand with a search warrant.

## and who more suited to the task than the woman he never forgot?
before he arrived, we intercepted a telegram...... he'd dispatched to his associates throughout europe.

## what kind of weapon could do that?
your ex wife may be on the verge to answer that question.

## the divorce was your idea, wasn't it?
you blackmailed elena to lure in the count...

## come here.
joaquin?

## what are you doing in jail?
i asked you first.

## is she okay?
no.

## where did you learn to do that?
prison changes a man, son.

## what if he puts up a fight?
i'm not going there to fight.

## how?
it doesn't matter.

## you forgive me?
everything you put me through.

## you?
i would not be in this mess if you had kept your mask on.

## then why are you still wearing his necklace?
i'm undercover.

## the only question is, who will claim victory?
we will determine the outcome...

## would a demonstration put your mind at ease?
you know, zorro could be anyone at all.

## tasty, is it?
it's unusual.

## is it quail?
pigeon.

## did you actually think...... that i would be swept off my feet by a sadistic coward like you?
i thought you were a woman of vision.

## for this?
no matter where you go, armand...... whatever you do...... the world isn't big enough to hide from me.

## where are you going?
to catch a train.

## can i get you something to drink?
you can lock me in a tower forever...... and i will never stop hating you.

## what are you doing?
when the car stops, get off and follow the tracks back to town.

## how did you get in here?
so the devil will know who sent you.

## why didn't you tell me who you are?
come here.

## can you hurry it up a little?
the people are calling.

## do you want her back?
of course i do.

## and you take him?

## otho, why don't you come in the front door?
it's bad luck.

we're not completely helpless.

## what's on the third floor?
attic space.

## you don't have a key?
maybe charles does.

## i can't believe we're eating cantonese.

i don't know why we keep looking in that stupid book.

## you didn't actually think that would work, did you?
i want to tell you what i saw.

## what is the point of my coming here if you people won't let me relax?
pumpkin, sweetheart... go help your mother.

we wanted to frighten you so you would move out.

## why don't you leave?
we haven't left since the funeral.

## can you do any tricks to prove i'm not dreaming?
if you are real ghosts, you better get another routine because those sheets... they don't work.

## what happened?

i think they were trying to scare you away, and you didn't get scared.

## where do they hide?
the attic.

## in there?
they must live like animals.

## where are they?
these ghosts are nice people.

## i think we scared them away, so let's leave them alone, all right?
it's the whole damn town.

## have they gone for good?
dad, don't.

## what are we doing?
now, let's turn on the juice and see what shakes loose.

## otho, can't you do something?
if i'm properly motivated.

## do you have a moment?
of course.

## or maybe something more substantial?
yes, that would be very nice.

## you dabble in the occult?
i found them here when i arrived.

## i wanted to ask you, did you treat bession?
you should let me clean that before it gets infected.

## or is it those evil spirits?
yeah.

## people can't really understand, can they?
if they weren't there... if they didn't see.

## so... what turns a man of the cloth into an archaeologist?
i don't know.

## do you miss it?
being a priest.

## gionetti?
he runs the sanitarium.

## what is your name?
i'm father merrin.

## hey, what's wrong?
hyenas.

## did you see that, lancaster?
the hyenas ignored joseph.

## can you hear?
come with me.

## monsieur bession?
mr. bession.

## was it in the church?
mr. bession.

## are you hurt?
no.

## have you drifted so far from god, merrin, that you can't see?
monsieur bession was touched by the devil.

## demonic possession?
forgive me, father.

## what does that mean?
in 1647, the ursuline convent in loudon, france... was plagued by possession.

## can i see?
you threw it away.

## jefferies, what the hell are you doing in here?
maybe if you could cure my fucking face...

## joseph?
he's coming for you.

## what?
he's coming for you.

## what happened?
i had a bad dream.

## where is everybody?
sebituana's baby is coming, so the village has gathered in welcome.

## are you all right?
yeah, i'm just a little bit tired.

## these lesions... they're not from the shock, are they?
no.

## so what is it?
in this part of the world... it could be a dozen things... but his symptoms don't really match any of them.

## will you be all right?
hmm.

## how was nairobi?
oh, fine.

## did you see monsieur bession?
he's dead.

## how?
i don't know.

## did bession talk about what he found under the church?
there's an ancient temple below, a pagan place... where they used to conduct sacrifices, human sacrifices.

## why would they build a church on top of something like that?
perhaps to purify the site.

## he blames the whites.
but then why bury it?

## you think the turkana took jefferies?
i think this place is on the verge of an uprising.

## you disagree?
in my experience, bringing soldiers into a situation is always a bad idea.

## who buried them?
everybody died.

## any answers on jefferies?
i'm afraid not.

## major granville?
the turkana won't like the show of force.

## so, what was it?
the evil in your church... it has taken emekwi's youngest son... and it is getting stronger.

## so you don't want to tell me?
he says he doesn't have to tell you because it's happening again... right now.

## then who's buried in that graveyard?
i'm sorry.

## are you praying... to god?
i dug up three graves.

## what happened here?
yes.

## what were they hiding?
that this place is damned.

## but it wasn't?
no.

## where did they go?
no one knows.

## what legend?
savages.

## leave me.
why are you here?

## sir?
i said, leave me.

## where's sarah?
i don't know.

## why?
turkana are coming to kill him.

## aren't you coming?
i have to find sarah.

## sarah?
the lord is coming for you.

## oh, my god.
sarah?

## bession was sarah's husband?
yes.

## she went into the church with him, didn't she?
francis.

## why would he listen to you?
you.

## fucking his only son while you call out his name?
he doesn't care about this whore.

## you have to be strong and concentrate.
you understand?

## can you read this?
i will start there.

## you understand?
sarah.

## okay?
thank you.

## sarah.
sarah, what is it?

## father?
she's with god now.

## didn't you?
good bye, mr. semelier.

## do you know my mother?
no.

## do i know you?
my name is semelier.

## so you think i'm a thief?
now you think i'm a thief and a whore.

## so what happened?
this is a leather impression of the artifact we're looking for... a representation of a mythical demon.

## what makes you think it's in a church in africa?
a major granville in nairobi is in charge of the dig.

## beautiful, aren't they?
it's a hobby from school days.

## what can you tell me about the dig?
the location is a remote area of the turkana district... called derati.

## what have they learned so far?
that it's a church where no church should be.

## how come you've opened the site to the vatican?
we haven't... officially.

## tell me, have you any theories on who might have built this church?
well, not until i've seen it.

## how long have you been with the dig, chuma?
since the beginning.

## what happened here?
plague.

## how many died?
all of them.

## is something bothering you, mate?
no.

## you drink, merrin?
i shouldn't... but my will is weak.

## right, doctor?
i'm sarah novak.

## so how are the interior excavations coming along?
they're not.

## has the structure collapsed?
no, the church is perfect... but none of the men will enter, those we have left anyway.

## why's that?
i shall be leaving for the dig in five minutes.

## other than that it's attached to his body?
could be an allergic reaction or some kind oflocalized infection.

## do you know why the men won't enter the church?
evil spirits.

## and do you?
no.

## did he?
well, he is mistaken.

## emekwi, can you see to mr. merrin's bags?
oh, of course.

## is this your first assignment, father?
before this, i was studying in the archives in the holy sea.

## but not really training for missionary work, is it?
this is strange.

## where's jefferies?
i need to go into the church.

## hyenas?
they've been here ever since we started digging.

## what's the matter with him?
i don't know.

## are you out here by yourself?
it's dangerous.

## so what is it you hope to find here?
the answer to why a church was built here a thousand years before christianity arrived.

## you were a priest once, weren't you?
yes, i was.

## how soon can you have the doors to the church uncovered?
a few days.

## and in the meantime, how do we get in?
we don't.

## is it safe to walk around?
let's see.

## you ever seen anything like it?
not this far from rome.

## who would do something like this?
the crucifix was broken off from here.

## chuma, is there an inventory of what's been found here?
i wouldn't know.

## who would know?
cause this place has been vandalized.

## so where can i find him?
i need to talk to him.

## why not?
he's gone mad.

## no one's been inside bession's tent since he fell ill?
they are superstitious.

## and you?
not superstitious.

## where's bession now?
a sanitorium in nairobi.

## how long has he been gone?
a few weeks.

## sorry?
the language spoken in palestine at the time of christ.

## and what does it say?
the fallen shall rise... in a river of blood.

## do you have a moment?
of course.

## or maybe something more substantial?
yes, that would be very nice.

i've already told you people.

## you a military man, lang?
sort of.

## you're either in or you're out, don't you think?
so a pretty straight forward answer i'm looking for here.

## are you in the military?
i can't talk to anybody in this building.

## are you a military man, lang?
i need to report to harrison, the joint chiefs or the president.

## you keep talking about this harrison... right?
we've been looking for him since you've mentioned his name.

## and guess what?
there is no harrison.

## that kind of smarts, doesn't it?
most fellows start belleding from the ears, but you took this pretty good.

## pretty effective, wouldn't you say?
i can't tell you what you want to hear.

## why don't we keep is simple, all right?
tell me how your day started.

## baby, go wait in your room, ok?

## is everybody ok?
we don't know.

## but this team of experts they only the best, right?

no, sir.

## daddy?
i'm toast.

## trainer?
i'm hall.

## you new on the base?
yes, sir.

## first time in alaska?
first.

## what have you heard about this mission?
bad news travels fast.

## get my volley?
ross...

## sir?
i wonder why they'd send a major on a mission like this.

## but why would a half decent looking chick like o'brien... want to be an officer?
everybody knows any chick that tough has to be a lesbo.

## dr. cole?
three hours ago, someone at our lab initiated an emergency lock down.

## dr. cole?
dr. lang... head of the bio weapons counter measures at vectol.

## dr. lang?
vectol labs do a multitude of sins.

## don't we have any other intelligence on this?
latest satellite re con flight shows all is clear.

## is that clear?
yes, sir.

## what are these syringes for, doctor?
excuse me.

## what happens then?
that depends on which toxin you've been infected with... but within 10 seconds your throat constricts.

## have either one of you tried... this needle?
yeah.

## what happened?
gear up.

## any other questions?
dismissed.

## what are you talking about?
she's a grown up.

## if i'm a terrorist, what's my primary target down there?
there's enough plutonium in that mountain to satisfy a small army.

## you got that?
cole... if we do encounter terrorists, stand down and let my team handle this.

## your team?
your team will do what i say.

## you got that, major?
trainer, hold up a sec.

## how many times have you and i been down this road before?
you watch my back, i'il watch yours all right.

## what?
the minute you know how to get out of there, you let me know.

## if they're terrorists you don't want to give away our position, right?
good point.

## will you back the fuck up?
holster that weapon.

## what's your concern, cole?
the reading.

## what's with this water?
i have no idea.

## what have you got?
looks like a gold tooth.

## is it toxic?
i don't think so.

## got a number 45 here... emptied the clip.
cole... what do you think?

## what the hell they shooting at?
no matter, but stay sharp so it doesn't end up shooting at you.

## ross, what do we do?
you have your orders.

## how many people we looking for?
fourteen.

## what is this stuff?
we're not sure just yet.

## where the hell is everybody?
i don't know.

## what are you talking about?
look around you.

## so, what's that got to do with me?
she's jailbait and she's the colonel's daughter.

## would you put a pipe in it?
she's not jailbait, captain.

## wouldn't you take a run at her if you had a chance?
careful, hall, or i'm going to take a run at you.

## want to get you guys a room?
hall's not my type, trainer.

## what?
no, that's impossible.

## what's gone?
i can't talk about it with you.

## are my people in any danger?
not more than the rest of us.

## copy?
go ahead, captain.

## anything on your end, sir?
one of the doctor's experiments has gone missing.

## what kind of an experiment?
they're both tight lipped.

## raise topside?
i could raise mars if i had to, but... it's probably easier to... jerry rig the up line and get cell communications working.

## what?
the doctor's experiments is probably just like the blob.

## you know what?
we're dessert.

## what are you talking about?
you're not funny, man.

## you see that?
i think.

## are you serious?
i'm serious.

## is it possible somebody moved it?
it's possible, but unlikely.

## what about the plutonium?
it got out.

## what happened?
i need to kill us all.

## lang, why didn't you try to help her?
she was infected.

## infected with what?
we can't be certain.

## hostile, sir?
we just met one of the staffers.

## secured, sir?
permanently.

## cole, you there?
yes, sir.

## situation?
the facility has been breached and the pb3 is missing.

## what's the difference between the liquid and pb3?
the liquid is what pb3 produces.

## is that so hard to believe?
i'm getting pretty tired of your bullshit, lang.

## sir?
go ahead, captain.

## what are you muttering about?
harrison would never implicate himself if anything were to go wrong.

## what if north korea knew the kind of warfare we were trying to perfect?
we're giving them a hard time with the nuclear program when all the while we're cloning aliens for military application.

## are you telling me that you're an independent contractor working with the military on cloning aliens?
you're not a believer.

## one that's more versatile, smart, dangerous we know humans to be?
every year, hundreds of meteorites slam into our planet.

## see what?
something tells me we're not alone.

## what do you thing it was?
looks like a guy about 10 feet ahead.

## what's going on back there, o'brien?
he's got a pulse.

## hurry up.
the guy though, where did he go?

## what happened to her?
come on, we got to get her out of here right now.

## what?
her eyes.

## what color are they?
they're black.

## you hang in there, all right?
we can't take her out of the mountain.

## she's my partner, do you hear me?
open the door.

## what did you do, bastard?
you shot her, you bastard.

## what?
what she was infected with has no known cure.

## like as in the movie?
the liquid is a bi product of the alien.

## you designed a fucking alien?
no, we cloned an alien.

## you cloned a frigging alien and the government thought that was ok?
it's also extremely intelligent.

## and what the hell goal is that?
it would like to control the planet.

## what do we do to control it?
we have been developing a...

## what are you talking about?
i developed a new strain.

## you did what?
the microbe was just the embryo.

## you honestly think you could spend the rest of your life in this hole?
i've been here for 5 years.

## to do what?
to publish... to receive the nobel.

## but for what?
the pb3.

## lang?
yes, colonel.

## are you ready to come out?
yes, there's nothing more i can do here.

## cole, how serious is it?
it's beyond our control, sir.

## sir?
evac your people within 10 minutes.

## how far are we going to get in 10 minutes?
10 minutes is plenty of time.

## you see that?
straight ahead.

## what do you think, trainer?
i think that's the same stuff that attacked o'brien.

## a killer vending machine?
can't believe we nailed an alien.

## spiders?
cole, watch your...

## hall, what were you thinking?
i'm going to get out of here.

## he's going to save us, right?
there's got to be another way out.

## any chance you can make the auxiliary air lock?
negative, sir.

## cole, you have anything that can fight this thing?
yeah, i think i do.

## we're going to be the first ones to use them?
that's right.

## shouldn't i get another warhead?
back over by the sink.

## shit, shit, shit.
doc, what do you make of this?

## what happened to him, cole?
the toxin.

## have you reset bomb?
not yet.

## are we facing a goddamn invasion?
it this thing gets out, we're facing extinction.

## how long can we stay exposed to this air?
long enough to make it to the next air lock it we're lucky.

## i got it.
what the frig is that?

## trainer?
i'm working on it.

## yeah, you?
i'm cool.

## any more surprises waiting for us down here, cole?
i sure hope not.

## was that your missing experiment back there?
i don't know what that was.

## how do you want to handle this?
very slowly towards the detonator and hope for the best.

## what?
it doesn't work.

## the detonator?
the detonator will work... but i got to arm it manually.

## sir?
get her to the exit.

## i've got no one waiting for me topside besides how often does a guy get a chance to save the world?
i'm so sorry.

## sir?
get this to harrison.

## not an option, ok?
trainer...

## ross... what do you want to do with this?
that ends here.

## the others?
they didn't make it.

## did you secure sample?
you know i couldn't do that.

## your helmet?
it's gone.

## you expect me to believe that?
you're telling me a story that you couldn't possibly have witnessed.

## did you witnesses that explosion?
the nuke would've killed everything.

## isn't it obvious?
i had to survive to keep my species alive.

## do you believe in me now?

caroline abbott.

## ls she feeling better?
the gao, the general accounting report said that...... there was $350, 000 in the safe of the committee to re elect the president.

## were you aware that it was that kind of funds from the very beginning?
a lot of people are watching me.

## was it all in $100 bills?
a lot of it was.

## how was it paid out?
not in one big chunk.

## what happened to the list?
it was destroyed.

## i can't be...... positive that the money was used for the break in, you understand?
yes, i do.

## how many?
a group of them.

## i don't want to say anymore, okay?
i won't be much longer.

## how much is \"so much\"?
ln one two day period, six million dollars came in.

## this is mr. liddy?
it's all so rotten.

## what do you think?
lf you guys could get john mitchell, that would be beautiful.

## ls there any evidence that...... any of mr. mitchell's assistants...... were part of this?
i had all the evidence.

## hard evidence?
i can't say that it would positively prove that they planned the break in...... but it would come pretty close.

## can you tell me anything about who got the money?
we've had...... some help on this from a couple sources.

## i don't want to say any more, okay?
i'm sorry.

## could we just go back for a second?
ln one six day period, over six million came in.

## you'd be crazy too, if you were operating on 20 cups of coffee.
these are the notes?

## could you give me something i can get down?
i got it.

## there were men working under mitchell  how many?
i don't know how many, but they received the money from the slush fund.

## do we know how much money we're talking about?
we're talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars.

## can we go back to what she said?
here.

## what do you mean?
she'd only give initials.

## lnitials?
the initials of the men who worked under mitchell.

## you couldn't get the names?
lf i could've, i would've gotten the names.

## what are you writing about sloan?
sloan was the treasurer of the committee to re elect.

## where's that matchbook?
here.

## how do we know that?
because she said it.

## so i said, \"you mean gordon liddy?
she said, \"yes.

## didn't he say that there was a bart porter...... who at one time was a member of the committee?
that's out.

## why do you think it's magruder?
because he was second in command under mitchell.

## why do you think it's magruder?
i think it's magruder because one time he was temporary head...... of the committee to re elect, before mitchell.

## what?
listen, we go back there...... and you ask her who \"p \"is.

## i say to her, \"who is 'p '?
then you say to me  i say, \"we know 'p 'is porter.

## you try to fake her out?
right.

## what if she denies it?
we're screwed.

## you have answers for everything, don't you?
lf we did, we wouldn't be here.

## what?
little jokes they're making down at finance these days.

## who is \"p\"?
p\", we know, is porter.

## who told you about porter?
i'd like to move on now to the subject of the break in at the watergate...... and the controversies that keep coming up out of that.

## did you know that documents had been destroyed?
no, i did not.

## aren't you the two from the post?
yes.

## ls it possible that some of his people might have known?
i'm not sure.

## do you think the truth will ever come out at the trial?
that's another thing i'm not sure about.

## why?
obviously, because certain people lied to the prosecutor.

## they \"meaning the white house?
the committee's not an independent operation.

## that report on the cash...... in the creep safe...... that $350, 000?
more.

## was that a correct figure?
it was closer to one million.

## and as treasurer, you could release those funds?
when so ordered.

## right?
i won't talk about the other two.

## they both worked at the white house?
one did, the other one's not in washington, but that's all i'il say.

## nixon's personal lawyer?
i can't say anything.

## when's the baby due?
soon.

## are you going to stay here?
no, i don't think so.

## decided where you'il go?
i've been looking for a job in the private sector, but it's...... it's very hard.

## when you handed out the money, how did that work, exactly?
badly.

## i think what bob means is, ordinarily, what was the procedure?
routine.

## this was done verbally?
yes.

## what about the other two?
we're pretty sure of kalmbach.

## certain on mitchell?
we know he approved payments to liddy while he was attorney general.

## who are they?
sloan.

## sloan and who else?
another guy at justice who won't confirm the other two, but we're working on it.

## what about deep throat?
he's not a source on this.

## but, do any of them have an ax?
personal, political, sexual.

## ls there anything at all on mitchell?
no.

## then can we use their names?
john mitchell.

## what does it say?

## is it morning or night?
you fellows have a great ball game going.

## there's no question you properly identified yourself?
he said it right off the top.

## did mitchell know he was talking to a reporter?
yeah, but i think i woke him up.

## do you have good notes?
verbatim.

## he really said that about mrs. graham?
well, cut the words \"her tit \"and print it.

## why?
this is a family newspaper.

## do you trust him?
yeah.

## what i can't figure out is, what is a real denial?
lf they start calling us goddamn liars, we better start circling the wagons.

## when you think they'il start doing that?
when they get out of tampa.

## what's going on with you guys at the fbl?
i've been trying to get to you for weeks.

## why?
you guys have been causing big trouble at the bureau.

## why?
our reports are showing up in your paper almost verbatim.

look, you know i can't answer for the whole bureau.

## we'il go to my place.
what orders?

## his travel records for the years 1971 72.

## does the fbl know about segretti?
the fbl interrogated him and found out he wasn't involved in the break in...... so they dropped it.

## where is he?
he's in california.

## donald segretti?
that's right.

## what can i do for you?
well, my paper just sent me out here to try...... to persuade you to go on the record.

## why me?
i guess because you were the head coordinator of nixon's...... sabotage campaign against the democrats.

## carl, you want some coffee?
you read my mind.

## what do you imagine the head coordinator does?
i guess you're involved in recruiting other people like yourself...... other lawyers.

## lawyers?
like alex shipley.

## what do you mean by illegal?
nickel and dime stuff.

## what was the one on muskie's stationery you sent out...... that said scoop jackson was having a bastard child?

yeah.

## why haven't they done anything?
lf it didn't deal directly with the break in, they didn't pursue.

## do you think something this size just happens?
haldeman had to know too.

## the letter...... that destroyed the muskie candidacy, the canuck letter...... did it come from inside the white house?
you're missing the overall.

## what overall?
they were frightened of muskie, and look who got destroyed.

## who's pete teller?

## do you guys know about the canuck letter?
yep.

## you mean the letter that sabotaged the muskie candidacy?

you're hedging.

## no, i want to hear her say it.
did he say it to impress you to get you to go to bed with him?

## why did it take you two weeks to tell us this, sally?
i guess i don't have the taste for the jugular you guys have.

## you're claiming it was a misunderstanding?
absolutely.

## i don't remember her getting that much wrong before, do you?
that's a real bullshit question, woodward.

## i mean, was it a restaurant, or her apartment, or a bar...?
i'd forgotten the entire incident, but it most certainly wasn't in her apartment.

## do you remember when it took place?
i don't have time for this.

## what did he say about meeting in a bar or restaurant?
he said he forgot the entire incident.

## wichita, kansas?

## you wouldn't?
no.

## little boy or girl?

## will you give our best to her?
i will.

## did he say john?
there's only one haldeman.

## what more do you need?
i happen to love this country.

## woodward?
i'm sure.

## i told you.
how many fucking sources do they think we've got?

## what about the guy in justice?
i can't call him.

## do you know when you expect him back?
i believe he left for the evening.

## could you hold, please?
hi, this is carl.

## i'm going to count to 10, all right?
lf there's any reason we should hold on the story, hang up before i get to 10.

## hang up, right?
that's right.

## you got it?
i'm going to start counting.

## everything's okay?
i said if i get up to 10 and you don't hang up, it's solid.

## did he confirm it?
no.

## would you comment on your testimony before the grand jury?
my attorney will answer that question.

## did he mention any use of funds for espionage activity?
none, whatsoever.

## why is the post trying to do it?
nothin '.

## didn't you say the fbl had the information on haldeman in the files?
because we have it in the notes...... from the conversation we had on the phone.

## i can't even be seen talking to either one of you bastards.
what the hell are you talking about?

## are we being set up?
maybe there was no mistake.

## okay.
then the whole thing was a set up?

## foreign?
all right, here's our headline.

## you fell asleep?
over here.

## i finally got sloan on the phone.
were we wrong?

## why didn't you tell me over the phone?
woodward says phones aren't safe.

## who's doing it?
it's being done.

## what happened to that justice source of yours?
i guess i made instructions too complicated.

## why didn't he?
because nobody asked.

## what else did he say?
he said everyone is involved.

## you know the results of the latest gallup poll?
half the country never even heard of the word \"watergate.

## mr. president, are you ready to take the constitutional oath?
if you will place your left hand on the bible and raise your right hand...... and please repeat after me.

## but who to send?
master windu still fights on dantooine.

## indeed.
what are we going to do?

## truly if you were sith, would this contest be not over?
it would not be so easy to defeat a sith.

## have you been watching, master?
i have indeed, lord tyranus.

## what is your bidding?
a jedi named anakin skywalker.

## general, are you all right?
i'm fine.

## haven't i?
yes, sir.

## now, where were we?
ah, yes.

## what's that?
commander, we just lost blue squadron.

## what was that?
i don't know, general.

## under control?
i don't think so.

## you have his coordinates?
then plug them in.

## you have the coordinates?
yes, general.

## what?
the crystal is the heart of the blade.

## may i remind our master jedi we have a more pressing mission?
a slight detour.

## huh?
hmm.

## ilum?
that planet is on the other side of the system.

## a slight detour?
well, actually, i don't have a more important place to be.

## r2, does this weather affect your sensors?
not in the slightest. or so he says.

## alone?
no.

## what is it, r2?
oh.

## r2 says there are two more still out there.
where?

## uh, 3po, could you get my coat?
of course, miss padm.

## but pain my heart is.
what is it, r2?

## what troubles you, master yoda?
nearly destroyed the temple was.

## do you have his position?
that's close enough, r4.

## obi wan?
yes, sir.

## master?
go.

## it's close, but where?
it's all around us.

## why weren't the jedi able to stop this assassination?
i cannot believe they do.

## master yoda, do you think it will really come to war?
worse than war, i fear...

## what do you sense, master?
impossible to see...

## do you have any idea who was behind the attack?
our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners, on the moons of naboo.

## to what end?
i don't know, but everything in my being tells me he was behind it...

## do you think that is a wise use of manpower during these stressful times?
chancellor, if i may comment, i do not believe the...\"... \"situation is that serious.

## kenobi.
annie?

## no assassin will try that way.
ani?

## any activity up here?
quiet as a tomb.

## you're using her as bait?
it was her idea...

## and yours are?
possibly.

## i try, master.
because of your mother?

## why do i think you are going to be the death of me?
don't say that master...

## then why don't you listen to me?
i will.

## can you see him?
i believe that 'he 'is actually a 'she '.

## where are you going?
to get a drink.

## you want some death sticks?
you don't want to sell me death sticks.

## why couldn't we see this attack on the senator?
masking the future is this disturbance in the force.

## do you think they are behind this?
out there, they are.

## do you think obi wan's apprentice will be able to bring balance to the force?
only if he chooses to follow his destiny.

## pride?!?
you believe you have a firm grip on politics but you are way too young to understand the situation.

## what?
annie...

## it is your name, isn't it?
it's anakin.

## why not?
because i can see what you're thinking.

## ahh... so, you have jedi powers too?
then my jedi protector will have to prove how grown up he is.

## do you need assistance?
i'm looking for dexter.

## waddya want him for?
dexter's not in trouble.

## are they friendly?
even in my adventures since i haven't seen a more beautiful place.

## are you allowed to love?
i never understood why he quit.

## how long have these attempts been going on?
i don't want anything to happen to my daughter.

## there's something else?
master, he should not be given this assignment.

## why?
he has a... an emotional connection with her.

## has master yoda gained any insight into whether or not this war will come about?
probing the dark side is a dangerous process.

## could you live like that?
... no, you're right.

## he is well, i hope.
i'm expected?

## jedi council.
who commissioned this cloning activity?

## master?
they only work on the weak minded.

## all right, i get the picture... whatever happened to him?
no.

## may we see him?
sure.

## was your trip productive?
fairly.

## that right?
your clones are very impressive.

## i'm a jedi.
aren't we all?

## whaddayaknow?
i've come to see my mother.

## what's it like?
cliegg lars.

## what are they doing?
the droid foundry seems to be working at full capacity.

## do you have any idea who that may be?
with the forename darth, a sith he must be.

## do you believe he could be the mysterious sido dyas, who made the deal for the clone army?
perhaps too many pieces are missing from this puzzle, there are.

## do you need help?
oh, miss padme, i'm so happy.

## anakin, what's wrong?
i... i killed them.

## what are you talking about?
not just the men... the women and children too.

## sometimes we must break the law in order to act in its best interest.
who can deny these are exceptional times?

## why are you here?
i am searching for jango fett.

## what?!?
it's my job to protect you and it's too dangerous.

## aren't you fed up with the corruption, the bureaucrats, the hypocrisy of it all?
without your cooperation i can do nothing to stop their execution.

## am i also to be executed?
i wouldn't think of such an offense.

## danger?
oh, no i shouldn't think so.

## do you have anything to say before your sentence is carried out?
you are committing an act of war.

## what are you talking about?
i love you.

## what are your orders?
the force is with us, my master.

## victory, you say?
not a victory.

## do you think it will really come to war?
hmm, the dark side clouds everything.

## do you have any idea who was behind this attack?
our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners on the moons of naboo.

## the situation is that serious?
no, but i do, senator.

## please?
the thought of losing you... is unbearable.

## you fell into that nightmare, master... and i rescued you, remember?
oh... yes.

## it has been far too long, master kenobi.
obi?

## ani?
my goodness, you've grown.

## why else do you think we were assigned to her if not to fiind the killer?
protection is a job for local security, not jedi.

## any activity up here?
quiet as a tomb.

## what's going on?
ah, she covered the cameras.

## what is she thinking?
she programmed r2 to warn us if there is an intruder.

## i know, but we also want to catch this assassin, don't we, master?
you're using her as bait.

## and yours are?
possibly.

## because of your mother?
he went that way.

## why do i get the feeling you're going to be the death of me?
don't say that, master.

## then why don't you listen to me?
i am trying.

## can you see him?
i think he is a she... and i think she is a changeling.

## where are you going, master?
for a drink.

## you wanna buy some death sticks?
you don't want to sell me death sticks.

## do you know who it was you were trying to kill?
it was a senator from naboo.

## and who hired you?
it was just a job.

## who hired you?
tell us.

## what about senator amidala?
she will still need protecting.

## hmm?
mesa honored to be taking on dissa heavy burden.

## why not?
it makes me feel uncomfortable.

## what if they realize you've left the capital?
well, then my jedi protector will have to prove how good he is.

## you wanna cup o 'jawa juice?
oh, yes.

## so, my friend, what can i do for ya?
you can tell me what this is.

## can you tell me where it came from?
thank you.

## well, if droids could think, there'd be none of us here, would there?
kamino.

## is it in the republic?
no, no.

## are they friendly?
oh, depends.

## depends on what, dex?
on how good your manners are... and how big your, uh... pocketbook is.

## did you call for assistance?
yes, yes, i did.

## are you having a problem, master kenobi?
yes, um, i'm looking for a planetary system called kamino.

## are you sure you have the right coordinates?
according to my information, it should appear in this quadrant here... just south of the rishi maze.

## are you allowed to love?
i thought that was forbidden for a jedi.

## hmm?
i'm looking for a planet described to me by an old friend.

## hmm?
liam, the shades.

## a thought?
anyone.

## master?
because someone erased it from the archive memory.

## that's impossible, isn't it?
dangerous and disturbing this puzzle is.

## do you see any way through negotiations... to bring the separatists back into the republic?
not if they feel threatened.

## what is your suggestion, master jedi?
oh, anakin's not a jedi yet.

## i'm expected?
master sifo dyas was killed almost ten years ago.

## the army?
yes.

## tell me, prime minister... when my master fiirst contacted you about the army... did did he say who it was for?
of course he did.

## and who was the original host?
a bounty hunter called jango fett.

## and where is this bounty hunter now?
oh, we keep him here.

## \"unaltered\"?
pure genetic replication.

## magnifiicent, aren't they?
i don't know.

## you gonna use one of your jedi mind tricks on me?
they only work on the weak minded.

## whatever happened to him?
i went into public service ; he went on to become an artist.

## you really don't like politicians, do you?
i like two or three... but i'm not really sure about one of them.

## how would you have it work?
that's exactly what we do.

## you?
yep.

## may we see him?
sure.

## was your trip productive?
fairly.

## ever made your way as far into the interior as coruscant?
once or twice.

## recently?
possibly.

## master who?
sifo dyas.

## is he not the jedi who hired you for this job?
never heard of him.

## really?
i was recruited by a man called tyranus on one of the moons of bogden.

## do you like your army?
i look forward to seeing them in action.

## what is it, dad?
pack your things.

## what's that?
uh, well, negotiations with a lightsaber.

## what can i do?
i will do anything that you ask.

## could you live like that?
no.

## do you think these cloners are involved in the plot to assassinate senator amidala?
no, master.

no.

good looking woman.

## where are you this time?
you rang, sir.

## a bit younger, perhaps?

that's wonderful.

## how were the women?

## so what?
stop splashing me.

## what do you know about kazamatsuri?
you never know what he's thinking.

## like this?
no, not even close.

## why didn't you say so earlier?
he's a mean one, alright.

## why me?
you have a fiance to consider.

## sir, how would you like to have some fun?
first, a spot of gambling to win some money, then a whorehouse for some real fun.

## another samurai has joined magobei.
what do you say?

## is that so?
i reckon he's preparing an army to attack us.

turn on your side, please ma'am.

## luck wasn't with you today, was it?
please come again.

## how do you feel?
i'm hanbei mizoguchi.

## what about my two friends?
the one called suzuki is fine.

## are you hungry?

i'il make some gruel.

## but you agree with me, don't you father?
regardless, stay in bed for now.

## do you like the sea?
yes, i do.

## how many men have you killed?
please tell me, sir.

you're so knowledgeable.

## was it?
this is a lovely place.

## are you alright?
yes.

## i wonder what caused that?
but it really is delicious.

## why are you both looking at me like that?
we escaped with just a mud bath, that's all.

## so that's all it was?
we got totally covered in mud.

## would you care for a drink?
no, thank you.

## did i tell you about his nosebleed?
according to the report, he's sufficiently recovered to gather herbs with a maiden.

## whatever is he thinking?

still with kazamatsuri.

## kazamatsuri, you say?
you must have heard.

## you're a friend?

are you alright?

## who on earth was that?
begging your pardon.

## you two again?
we are to escort heishiro back to the domain.

## don't you agree?
so skillful, but hidden away in the boondocks.

## why?
because i'm a member of the underworld.

## how do you feel now?
i thought i'd die.

## why didn't you tell me earlier?
i swapped a fake for this, the real sword.

## father is ill?
no time to argue, sir.

## how long have you lived like this?
since i was this big.

## doesn't your father wish to work as an official?
he's not the kind of man to push himself forward.

## may i help you?
yes.

## it may seem rude to ask...... but why did he adopt you in the first place?
i was relieved to hear you're going to the whorehouse.

## really truly?
thank you so much.

## it's councilor inukai's lad.
watch?

## something wrong with him?
i heard he had a heart attack.

## you?

## you want to try?

## hanbei mizoguchi?
let's have a duel.

## why so eager to cross swords with me?

he's the stupid son of an hereditary councilor.

## how about another helping?
mr. inukai.

## he's hopeless.
you remember, don't you?

you could've told her something else.

## what's so funny?
kendra is an ex patient of mine, an actress.

## you were messing with me?
yeah.

## where's your phone?
she's not home, dave.

## you mean andrew?
and take me home, you psychotic piece of wacko.

## what did she say?
well, she's not mad at you anymore, but she let me have it pretty good.

## friends?
take a little nap.

## where are we?
well, at a great deal of expense and effort...... we've managed to locate your grade school bete noire, arnie shankman.

## do you mean the kid who bullied me in fifth grade?
dave, i think it's pivotal for you to confront your childhood nemesis.

## this is where arnie shankman lives?
you're kidding me.

## are you ashamed that you never stood up to him?
no.

## excuse me, arnie shankman?
sorry about waking you up.

## could you excuse him for a second, peanuts?
his name's not peanuts.

## you want me to fight a monk?
he's not even allowed to hurt a plant.

## dave said, \"how does a guy who weighs over 600 pounds...... have the balls to teach people about self discipline?
let's not make fun of my god, here.

## you know what else dave finds particularly piquant?
recalling your nut job sister struggling with her underpants in a straitjacket.

## you think that's funny?
dave used to con her into getting naked...... by saying that her clothes had ghosts in them.

## did you expose yourself...... to my sister?
over and over again.

## you all right?
you're all right.

## you really molested a crazy girl?
no.

## that's what was so hard to say to me?
this is not the davis cup, john, this is group therapy.

## now go take a fury fighters nap, all right?
don't gnash your teeth.

## now, what keys do we need to possess before we can?
dave.

## you told linda we should have a trial separation?
yes.

## she told you i was a premature ejaculator?
that part i was assuming.

## are you all right?
i'm fine.

## and don't hold back, okay?
because there's a lot of nice guys out there and i'm cool with it.

## what else could i do, huh?
you should've tossed a rock at him.

## the guy's homeless, right?
let him be.

## could you bring it down a little bit?
we're trying to have dinner.

## what are you guys doing here?
i need to see dr. b. i'm in crisis.

## why don't you go look for him?
davey, your girlfriend stopped by and she dropped these off for you.

## why?
i heard her on her cell phone...... talking to a guy...

## she's not taking a break from the old sausage, huh?
sorry.

## you like stacy better or something?
it's just that i want to go on a fake date to get my girlfriend jealous...... so i really only needed one of you guys.

## so do you know the guy she's with?
i think i might.

## does size count at all, or is that just some weird thing guys think about?
this is where gina and i always get into a heated debate.

## may we take your coats?
no.

## actually, could you give us a table overlooking that table right there?
sure.

## who?
nobody.

## what?
i can't believe this.

## are those your friends?
i'm supposed to date other people so i figured i'd give it a try.

## gina, can you stop sucking on stacy's finger for one second?
i want to introduce you to somebody.

## you know stacy and gina?
two of the usual, duke.

## what are you saying?
i'm trying to give you a hand.

## what was she saying?
the good news is, i already launched a preemptive strike.

## how?
i will be uncharacteristically aggressively boring.

## you swear to me this will work?
the ball's already up in the air.

## where were you?
i was way too smashed to drive.

## now, you say you kissed?
it was nothing.

## how do you end up kissing, again?
i wish i knew, keed.

## you had your crazy, corroded tongue in my girlfriend's mouth?
just a second.

## linda?
i've got some good news for you and some potentially upsetting news.

## is it all right if i date your ex?

## numb nuts, where's the catalog for my fat cat clothing line?
i said i'd have it by 3.

## what's this?
your fat shit cat's been sitting there all day.

## can i get two couches in my office?
if friends come over, i want them to feel comfortable.

## what office?
frank was nice enough to give me some creative executive position.

## you gave him the job that i wanted?
he earned it.

## why can't you be happy for me?
linda's gonna be.

## know something?
i'm sick of you hanging out with linda.

## did he steal my proposal idea?
buznik, your behavior is unacceptable.

## unacceptable?
i've been getting your coffee and doing your work for five years now.

## when a good position actually opens up...... you give it to the biggest dick in the world?
i don't know about the world, but it's definitely the biggest one in the room.

## you see?

## are you kidding?
i'm out of my mind.

## dr. b, how's it going?

i guess i never thought it through.

## everything all right, buddy?
oh, yeah.

## who was that guy?
i think it's bill clinton.

## that wasn't so bad, was it?
i can't believe you actually started to fall for that crazy man.

## you're telling me the past two weeks of my life was just therapy?
well....

## so how much of this thing was a setup?
well, the guy in your seat on the plane, the flight attendant, the judge...... they're all friends of buddy's.

## dave said, \"how does a guy who weighs over 600 pounds...... have the balls to teach people about self discipline?
let's not make fun of my god, here.

## you know what else dave finds particularly piquant?
recalling your nut job sister struggling with her underpants...... in a straitjacket.

## you think that's funny?
dave used to con her into getting naked...... by saying that her clothes had ghosts in them.

## did you expose yourself...... to my sister?
over and over again.

## you all right?
you're all right.

## you really molested a crazy girl?
no.

## that's what was so hard to say to me?

yes.

## she told you i was a premature ejaculator?
that part i was assuming.

## are you all right?
i'm fine.

## and don't hold back, okay?

## what else could i do, huh?
you should've tossed a rock at him.

## the guy's homeless, right?
let him be.

## could you bring it down a little bit?
we're trying to have dinner.

## what are you guys doing here?
i need to see dr. b. i'm in crisis.

## why don't you go look for him?
davey, your girlfriend stopped by and she dropped these off for you.

## why?
i heard her on her cell phone...... talking to a guy...

## she's not taking a break from the old sausage, huh?
sorry.

## you like stacy better or something?
it's just that i want to go on a fake date to get my girlfriend jealous...... so i really only needed one of you guys.

## so do you know the guy she's with?
i think i might.

## does size count at all, or is that just some weird thing guys think about?
this is where gina and i always get into a heated debate.

## may we take your coats?
no.

## actually, could you give us a table overlooking that table right there?
sure.

## who?
nobody.

## what?
i can't believe this.

## are those your friends?
i'm supposed to date other people so i figured i'd give it a try.

## gina, can you stop sucking on stacy's finger for one second?
i want to introduce you to somebody.

## you know stacy and gina?
two of the usual, duke.

## what are you saying?
i'm trying to give you a hand.

## what was she saying?
the good news is, i already launched a preemptive strike.

## how?
i will be uncharacteristically aggressively boring.

## you swear to me this will work?
the ball's already up in the air.

## where were you?
i was way too smashed to drive.

## now, you say you kissed?
it was nothing.

## how do you end up kissing, again?
i wish i knew, keed.

## you had your crazy, corroded tongue in my girlfriend's mouth?
just a second.

## linda?
i've got some good news for you and some potentially upsetting news.

## you gave him the job that i wanted?
he earned it.

## why can't you be happy for me?
linda's gonna be.

## know something?
i'm sick of you hanging out with linda.

## did he steal my proposal idea?
buznik, your behavior is unacceptable.

## unacceptable?
i've been getting your coffee and doing your work for five years now.

## when a good position actually opens up...... you give it to the biggest dick in the world?
i don't know about the world, but it's definitely the biggest one in the room.

## you see?
i golf also.

## are you kidding?
i'm out of my mind.

## dr. b, how's it going?

i think it's regis philbin.

## that wasn't so bad, was it?
i can't believe you actually started to fall for that crazy man.

## how do i look?
seriously.

## christopher \"limey\"?

## we?
a girl can hope.

## miami beach?

now, that's the cassie i know.

## you'il be around later?
perhaps.

## what?
that you've overestimated yourself.

## finished?
yeah.

## friends?
women.

## is this taken?
no.

## patrick, can i be honest?
sure.

## i'm sorry?

## can i show you something?
sure.

## what is it?
a short story.

## you want my feedback?
i'm gonna go read it.

## how can you be so insecure?

## what is it?
nothing, patrick.

## the orgasm?
of course.

## really?
that's...... fascinating.

## so are you liking the states?
excuse me.

## what does it look like?
a date.

## what?
i barely know you.

## what's wrong with me?
i have spoken two words to you in my entire life.

## what?
this must be some sort of mistake, christopher.

## to judge her?
look...... it's cassidy's purse.

## what do you know?
i think christopher will be interested in this.

## so how does it feel to be used?
you know better than anyone.

## what's wrong with you?
look at you with your tight ass and your perfect little tits.

## get what?
you wouldn't give a guy like me the fucking time of day.

## what?
it looks like you lost your bet on christopher.

## he sure isn't sleeping with you now, but you know what?
don't give jason the money, give it to me.

## so, what did you get out of this?
one look at the expression on your face.

## i mean, come on...... what are the chances?
oh, by the way, your story...... it sucked.

## who's ever had sex where someone didn't get hurt?
you're bitter.

## where'd you get the nerd act?
well, i spent a long time trying to hide the homely.

## so, what's next?
we'il see.

## hey, alison, want a drink?
i have a fianc back home.

## vodka or gin?
oh, vodka.

## do you have a favorite painting?

## alison?
never.

## what do you mean?
i can't remember the last time i was satisfied by sex.

## you bored?
i guess so.

## as what?
a weapon.

## how you feeling?
strangely attracted to you.

## what about it?
i came to tell you it's pathetic.

## why?
if you had me, you could have anyone.

## where's the challenge?
you're forgetting i haven't had you yet.

## cassidy?
i do love her, but no.

yes.

## really?
sheila and michael are such a cute couple...... and you, trying to come between them.

## jealous?
sheila's going to love my big, bulging brain.

## what's wrong?
i was supposed to go visit my grandmother near carmel...... but i missed the sign up for eldridge's trip.

## why don't you fly?
kind of on a tight budget.

## yeah?
yeah, she's dragging me.

## hey, would you guys be willing to visit her for me?
i have some things you could give her.

## why don't you just take my place on the trip?
michael, you and sheila planned this.

## you sure?
you've been looking forward to this trip.

## why don't we give jason a chance to see his grandmother?
wow, i'm speechless, but i wouldn't even consider it...... unless it's okay with sheila.

## mamaw\"?
you never wanted to fuck me more than right now.

## what's wrong?
alison...... i love you.

## what?
i love you.

## david, your fianc, are you in love with him?
we're engaged.

## but are you in love with him?
because if you aren't...

right on schedule.

## yeah?
well, i'm ahead of schedule.

## where are you going?
carmel.

## with michael and sheila?
nope.

## what?
you look surprised.

## look, is it really that crazy that i'm better at this than you are?
no, he just said, \"i love you \"out of nowhere.

## god, what was he thinking?
i know.

## when i first brought up going to school out here to david...... you know what he said?
go.

## it's awful, isn't it?
i mean, he's so great about it...... but i just found myself wishing that he'd be protective...... love me too much to let me go.

## patrick?
i care about patrick, i'm just...

## it all sounds terrible, doesn't it?
no, not at all.

## excuse me?
that fianc of alison's isn't a lock.

## heads or tails?
heads.

## what?
our relationship.

## i mean, you're confused, right?
so am i. are we buddy buddy or...

## what do you mean?
dinner, flowers...... it's all just a little...... sudden.

## heads or tails?
jason.

## master or slave?
slave.

## how are you?
good.

## how are you?
okay.

## how's the weather?
it's pouring rain.

## sheila, what are you guys doing?
just hanging out.

## what?
i said, you sound weird.

## is something wrong?
no.

## what?
sheila, you're freaking me out.

## what's going on?
i'm fine.

## are you okay?
i'm gonna...

## who is it?
it's me.

## oh, my god, what happened?
i cheated on david.

## brent?
look, you made a mistake.

## are you sure?
yes.

## you're gonna be okay?
yes, i'm sure.

## what?
brent.

## you know?
open it.

## in that envelope are more pictures, so if you don't keep your mouth shut...... that envelope's gonna find a mailbox.
what are you doing?

## do you understand?
yes.

## put brent up to it?
i paid him 500 bucks to forget about cassidy and sleep with you.

## he asked for 1000, can you believe that?
i cared for you, and you rejected me for david crestwood...... who you just betrayed for a fucking piece of ass.

## i mean, am i crazy?
i could see it between them.

## what am i supposed to do?
well, there is one thing.

## so where's michael?
off, thinking of me.

## why, is something wrong?
i mean, other than with mamaw's hips.

## why does it matter to you what i do with michael?
you're jealous.

## all this and brains too?
i think it's you who's jealous.

## how's alison?
after this, they either gain or lose weight.

## what?
she needs to drop the freshman 15.

## what about you and sheila?
we both had a good time.

## what did alison ever do to you?
you have no fucking idea.

## what is?
well, patrick and i don't have anything going on, and i'm not bored.

## how do you feel?
happy.

## after you saw me mind fuck michael into replacing him on that trip...... did you ever fantasize about me?
maybe.

## do you believe in second chances?
if i died and i got the chance to come back for one day, any day...... l'd choose this one.

## seriously, that's your best material?
it's not material.

## now, does that feel like a guy who's using material?
god, cassidy, when i look at you, i can barely put two words together.

## i'm sorry?
we set it up a while back.

## morally out there?
i'm not quite so far out there, but i was born with certain qualities.

## why so protective?
because.

## because?
just because.

## just because?
because i care about you.

## do i have to spell it out for you?
if i don't want you eating with patrick, it's because, yes...... l'm jealous, and i'm worried.

## what do you want?
and that's not all.

## yeah?
i'm thinking about staying in southern california.

## what's up?
i have a proposition for you.

## weren't alison and sheila enough?
they were nothing.

## the big one?
there's only one girl worth competing for now.

## what's left except competing for cassidy?
no, i'm not competing for cassidy.

## so you'il be pissed if i get up her first?
this began with cassidy and us, this has to end with cassidy and us.

## what are you afraid of?
not you.

## what's wrong?
you're trying to win her anyway.

## to make it official?
one dollar.

## so let me get this straight, you're in love with me?
sucks to be me.

## did you change your mind?
i've come to say that i've figured you out.

## what?
you know i don't fall that easy.

## do you care that no one's ever gonna fall in love with you?
i don't know if you can love...... but you like hating more anyway.

## are you uglier on the outside or on the inside?
when you've been ignored as long as i, we'il see what you do to get noticed.

## and he really loves you?
yes.

## did you hear what i said, cassidy?
jason doesn't love you.

## do you think jason was going to tell you about it?
trust the truth.

## what happened?
you had to choose between me and patrick...... and you chose patrick.

## how could you?
i really loved you.

## why?
because you were in love...... and now you're not.

## we underestimated the evil in you?
you underestimated the evil in yourselves.

## so you don't know what it feels like to be a victim?
no.

## recognize?
jason swiped them.

## see what happens when you underestimate?
you took me so lightly.

## would you tell me what this is all about, please?
we'il let you know down at the station.

## ends?
you and me.

## why?
because after everything...... that we put you through, you finally wanted out.

## what about us?
i mean...

## well?
i knew you'd understand.

## did you have a nice swim?
yes, thank you.

## why the hell not?
sebastian, sebastian, stop pouting.

## speaking of shaping up, how's mrs. freeman doing?

## i like the girl, okay?
i like her a lot.

## i just did or weren't you listening?
you do realize this means war.

## did she die?
i take it you don't like her.

i think you're beautiful.

## do you wanna come back to my place?
i'd love to, but i have an oral report due in the morning.

yeah, i'il be fine.

## and how are you finding manchester?
oh, it's no problem.

## how much money have you raised?
well, she barely has to do anything.

## why do they throw money at you?
because charity is smiled upon by the ladies who lunch.

## you know the social ladder?
pardon me.

## so, how much money do you need?
oh, i didn't invite you over here to discuss fund raising, bunny... but if you'd care to make a donation, we'd certainly consider it.

## how was your day?
i can explain this.

## cash or charge?

## don't you remember us?
miss bartlett and miss honeychurch.

## how do you do?
i heard you are to be our vicar.

## you think i ought to have accepted?
you think i have been narrow minded.

## emerson...... we accept his offer?
i would like to thank your father personally for his kindness.

## whatever does it mean?
lucy, get dressed or the better part of the day will be gone.

## may i say something rather daring?
mr. beebe, you sound like miss lavish.

## are you writing a novel, too?
if i were, you would be my heroine.

## won't you play some more?
no, i think i'il go out.

## is that wise, miss honeychurch?
to be wise, one might have stayed at home.

## whatever's the matter with dear miss lucy?
i put it down to too much beethoven.

## but why should he be?
well may you ask.

## and on what?
the things of the universe.

## do you?
i forget my worries at the piano, and collecting stamps helped my brother.

## poor girl?
i think myself most fortunate.

to physical sensation.

## for a character in your novel?
the young english girl, transfigured by italy.

## and why should she not be transfigured?
it happened to the goths.

## grazie.
signorina?

## how are you now?
i must have dropped them in the square.

## sit down and don't move until i come back.
would you be so kind...?

## isn't it extraordinary?
i mean, italians are so kind, so lovable, and yet at the same time so violent.

## mr. emerson?
i've never been so ashamed.

## you understand what i mean?
no.

## so, miss honeychurch, you're traveling.
what was that?

## as a student of art?
no, i'm afraid not.

## as a student of human nature like myself?
i'm here as a tourist.

## indeed?
we residents sometimes pity you poor tourists not a little.

## your father, mr. emerson, is a journalist?
he used to be.

## and you, yourself?
please, i'il deal with them.

## could that be the silent, dour george?
the gentlemen are doubtless having a game.

## why don't you join them, dear?
i want to stop here with you.

## and she never went back to weybridge?
her friend had to return without her.

## and did she really...?
no, no.

## did she really marry this italian?
in the church at monteriano.

## buoni uomini?
i think there is something in the italian landscape which inclines even the most stolid to romance.

## aren't you coming with us?
i'il walk.

## are you sure?
courage, miss honeychurch, and faith.

## do you suppose this display is called into existence to extinguish you or me?
even scientifically, the chances against being struck are enormous.

## the driver?
my dear girl, no.

## exploits?
very well.

## this afternoon, if i had not arrived, what would have happened?
i can't think.

## and deservedly.
what would have happened had i not appeared?

well, you tell her everything.

## don't you?
i suppose i do, generally.

## you?
he asked my permission also.

## whatever did you say?
so i said no, i wasn't.

## mother?
lucy.

## do you suppose i shall get it?
food is the one thing one does get here.

## you think his sister is promising?
i have a pet theory about miss honeychurch.

## is it not odd that she should play beethoven with such passion and live so quietly?
i suspect that one day...... music and life will mingle.

## shall we join the others?
congratulations.

## i don't think i'd like anyone at that pensione.
what are five miles from the station these days?

## wasn't there a lady novelist and a free thinking father and son?
i have no profession.

## would cecil and i be missed if we went for a walk?
i think it would be all right.

## don't you like mr. beebe?
i never said so.

## i'il write to them, and if you'd also send a word?
certainly.

## you know the proverb?
i somehow think you feel more at home with me in a room.

## and you?
i used to bathe here, too.

## hmm?
yes, i suppose we ought to be going.

## yes?
i have never kissed you.

## may i now?
well, of course you may, cecil.

## my reply impressed her favorably.
so, you do love me, little thing?

## lucy?
go for her.

## who?
sir harry's new tenants.

## wasn't whose name?
sir harry's tenants.

## cecil?
i have found him tenants for his cissie villa.

## friends of mine?
the joke is to come.

## of course, london has its own character, but we've a longing for green things growing, don't we, george?
hello.

## hello?
george reads german.

## this is mr. honeychurch.
what are those people doing?

## how do you do?
come and have a bathe.

## how do you do?
glad to see you.

## do you really want this bathe?
yes, i've said so.

## where did you meet mr. vyse?
the national gallery.

## you see?
you talk of coincidence and fate.

## who were those unfortunate people?
this way, mrs. honeychurch.

## freddy, must you?
the truth is, you don't like charlotte.

## wasn't it any good?
because otherwise, i cannot account for him.

## is it a thing or a person when freddy sings?
you can't expect a really musical person to appreciate comic songs as we do.

## must he sneer and spoil everyone's pleasure?
go and dress, dear.

## need we have charlotte?
we needn't.

## would you like it closed?
the ticket says dorking.

## what are you doing here?
my father lives here.

## are you all right?
oh, yes.

## oh, how do you do, mr. vyse?
and mr. floyd, a friend of freddy's.

## who do i give the sovereign to?
toss for it, honeychurch.

## how so, mr. vyse?
because fifteen and five shillings make a pound.

## have some tea.
why is mr. vyse taking the quid?

## and why doesn't she pay the bob for the driver?
a shilling for the driver.

## does anyone have change for half a crown?
for a sovereign.

## have you told him about him?
no, i haven't, nor anyone.

## how do you know?
because i know.

## shall we go out?
dear, a moment.

## have you spoken to him yet?
it's only a library book of cecil's.

## where is the child?
dear, i'm so sorry, i don't seem to have any small change.

## could you...?
yes, easily.

## did you mind losing?
of course.

## what's the title?
of course.

## do you like our view, mr. emerson?
my father says there's only one perfect view the view of the sky over our heads.

## do i have to?
no, of course not.

## isn't it immortal?
there came from his lips no wordy protestations such as formal lovers use.

## shall we go in to tea?
by all means.

## do you know miss lavish's novel?
there's a scene in it the hero and heroine make love.

## do you know about it?
cecil read it to me.

## go and call him.
why did you tell her?

## call mr. vyse?
no.

## you mean to marry that man?
you're being ridiculous.

## and the fact i love cecil and shall be his wife shortly is of no importance?
this tremendous thing has happened between us and it means... it means nothing must hinder us ever again.

## haven't you done enough?
don't interfere again.

## why does italy make lady novelists reach such summits of absurdity?
lucy, it's still light enough for another set.

## because i wouldn't play tennis?
i never do play tennis.

## what do you mean?
if you think i love someone else, you're mistaken.

## will you shake hands?
of course i will, cecil.

## so you're off, mr. vyse?
yes.

## isn't it wonderful?
the parthenon, the frieze of phydias.

## have you ever met these miss alans?
never.

## got any matches?
thank you.

## when?
late last night.

## will they want me to go down?
yes.

## i'il take minnie to the beehive tavern.
how do you do, mr. beebe?

## but, if you know of a good pensione in constantinople, we should be so grateful.
care to join us, miss bartlett?

## isn't that delightful?
i do believe they'il end by going round the world.

## did he?
i needn't say it will go no further.

## did freddy say he'd drive straight back?
no, he didn't.

## would your mother spare you?
she must.

## don't you see i have to go away?
charlotte, the miss alans are going to constantinople.

## in lieu of constantinople, could not we lure you to tea at the beehive?
no, thank you.

## don't you see?
i must go somewhere.

## what?
that i've broken off my engagement.

## you mean mr. emerson?
charlotte, how slow you are.

## lucy, are you absolutely sure?
i only want to do what is right for you.

## like what?
like charlotte bartlett.

## lucy has a plan.
marian?

## isn't this a tragedy?
i get one thing tied up and another thing falls over.

## or does work keep him in london?
we shall meet him when he sees you off.

## really?
but, in this case...

## you aren't going?
yes, we've a train to catch.

## why not announce it?
i promised.

## how should one look?

not a word.

## what were you told?
that he loves her.

## won't you sit down?
i think i hear the carriage.

## why don't you sit back, make yourself more comfortable?
take this.

## why rush off to the ends of the earth?
you're tired of your home.

## powell, is that house to be let again?
sir harry's looking for new tenants, i hear, miss.

## so you see, it is all my fault.
did you hear what i said, lucy?

## where are you going?
your mother offered to fetch me in her carriage.

## and now where's lucy?
forgive me, but it seems to me you're in a muddle.

## what did you all think?
then...

## why should they?
we have a view.

## what are you reading?
it's from freddy.

## what does he say?
silly boy, he thinks he's being dignified.
