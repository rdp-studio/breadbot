we don't even have a boat.

## what does this look like to you?
my god.

## anacondas keep growing till they die, right?
and these are the biggest bill's ever seen.

## this is proof?
it's anecdotal evidence at best.

## do you have any idea how close we are?
the orchid was found here...... on the mendranang, just around the next bend.

## what if some local farmer decides to slash and burn the entire basin?
instead of the fountain of youth, we'll have a giant rice paddy.

## do you wanna give in when we're this close?
look.

## you know i got your back, right?
we've been in the trenches a hundred times together.

## what are you talking about?
he offered bill an extra 50 grand...... to keep going, even though he knew it wasn't safe.

## what's that mean?
it's korean.

## what brought you here?
long story.

## where am i gonna go?
all right.

## sometimes we do the wrong things for the right reasons, you know?

## the right thing?
it's always a good place to start.

## how's that?
much better.

## kotabaru?
i'd say...

## another day?
i'm not rowing another day, homeboy.

## are you sure this is a big story?
the proper term is scoop.

## hey, where are you going?
press.

## do you have an appointment?
there's a coup going on in that boardroom.

## is that a problem?
take it easy, hank.

## no, take it easy?
i'm not going to take it easy.

## how come he waltzes through?
seor aribau has the exclusive rights to all nova communications.

## just follow my lead, and it'll be fine, okay?
good morning, christina, you look beautiful.

## can i see the boss?
just a minute, please.

## did you call the press, seor pla?
no, i did not.

## what's this?
this is my offer, seor sert.

## let's go.
you're trying to buy me out?

## go where?
in there, where the story is.

## you know what else is in there?
someone with a gun.

## who are you people?
we are anarchy now.

## twenty share?
speaking as your producer, i'm thrilled.

## interference?
either god's talking to us... or it's someone's cell phone.

## can't you see the sign?
i'm most terribly sorry.

## 1999?
i'm here to see mr. robinson.

## is your studio fully soundproof?
of course.

## jordi, what the hell are you doing?
sorry, miss nadal.

## hank goes on in 10 minutes.
hank robinson?

## have you met veronica, my producer?
oh, yes, indeed.

## shall we?
it's kind of our baby.

## 100, 000?
55, 000, sir.

## what can i do for you?
mr. robinson, i'm here on a rather serious matter.

## did you know that he worked for me?
yes, he was a wonderful reporter.

## i beg your pardon?
that's right, hank, your gravy train has come in.

## yeah, but at what price?
my father worked for 10 years before the networks called... and when they did, he jumped at it.

## you made a decision like that without me?
i'm your partner, i'm your girlfriend.

## you know what?
i'll bet they probably do.

## i'll ask them, all right?
you do that.

## yeah?
my camcorder... the one you filmed your nova story with.

## what's your point?
none of my business how you got the story.

## just share the wealth, you know?
i'm a talented guy, and i'm shooting porn to make ends meet.

## are you blackmailing me?
no, i would never do that.

## we're friends, right?
yeah.

## okay, what are you waiting for?
impress me.

## robinson, how the hell did you end up in spain?
i thought there were more career opportunities in europe.

## if you want to last here, you will follow instructions, claro?
claro.

## questions?
no, ma'am.

## how are you planning to deal with the threat?
i have faith in the loyalty of my stockholders.

## can you really fault them their success?
think of a world in which one company provided every service.

## are you enjoying your new job?
i am, yes.

## did you know him?
our paths crossed briefly.

## what do you mean?
you know what it's like... trying to weed out the liars from the honest men.

## who's this?
you've got 45 minutes.

## the anarchist attack, remember?
you didn't sit on your ass.

## what do you want?
the gothic knights bar, robinson.

## and, hey, make sure there's film in the camera this time, okay?
nothing personal.

## did you confront agustin?
of course.

## who's agustin's biggest rival?
nova.

## who did the terrorists attack?
nova.

## who benefits?
agustin.

## mr. robinson?
manuel pla.

## would you like a drink?
sure.

## how are things?
fine.

## marisa?
yes, she's my intern.

## is that what they call it now?
i miss you.

## talk?
i've left some of my things at your place.

## what's that?
alone, filming the anarchists.

## on duty?
always, keeping an eye on things.

## you on duty?
always.

## you identified any of the anarchists?
we have our suspicions.

## do you?
i have a story.

## if i show you a picture, can you confirm it?
you can't name me.

## what do you need?
her name is leila krtolica.

## but what's her connection to agustin?
terrorists need funding.

## you tell me eloy agustin is a sponsor of terrorism?
according to my interpol source.

## what is the connection between anarchy now operative leila krtolica... and eloy agustin of intertel?
recently, krtolica assassinated the president of nova...

## coincidence?
seor agustin has denied any connection with any terrorist group... and maintains he is the victim of a frame up.

## thoughts?
not bad.

## what do you want, a cookie?
we'll lead with it tonight.

## happy?
jesus, veronica, i thought you were looking for...

## so what are you doing here?
i told you, i left some things behind.

## you watch vision tv?
only when you're on.

## and?
you did good.

## didn't your father ever teach you to keep your powder dry?
your story on agustin caused quite a stir.

## ever wonder what a limey like me was doing in spain?
i love it.

## didn't they teach you anything at school?
yes.

## hello?
yes, he is.

## you going to give me your name this time?
call me crusader.

## okay, crusader... how did you know that agustin was sponsoring terrorism?
a magician never explains his tricks.

## listen... why me?
you're a rising star, hank.

## listen, how do i get a hold of you if i need you?
you were handed the story on a silver platter.

## what are you complaining about?
i don't trust him, or like him.

## what?
okay, i know what this is about:fear of success.

## anything interesting?
the usual.

## listen... how did aribau make it big?
i heard, out of nowhere, he got a lead.

## out of nowhere?
aribau had a secret source.

## that first big job?
industrial espionage.

## seor agustin?
seor agustin, we need to talk.

## now, how did you meet the girl?
she came up to me, at the conference.

## a woman that beautiful is interested in you, do you chase her away?
she said you wanted me dead.

## are you telling me she's a mercenary?
the americans have a term for people like her.

## pla?
only a fool.

## they had on, what do you call it?
the motorcycle mask.

## are you all right?
everything is fine.

## do you understand?
i don't exist, hank.

## you want me dead next?
listen to me.

## murdered?
yes.

## are you sure?
yes.

## what?
they found a note in his home, and there is an eyewitness.

## what are you talking about?
that's insane.

## what time did it happen?
take it easy.

## veronica, hi, it's me.
but... how did he know?

## good?
can't complain.

## do you get overtime?
pedro.

## did they give you an assistant?
yeah.

## is she a babe?
pedro, the tape.

## was the camera damaged in any way?
well...

## how long is that going to take?
a day.

## now, about your assistant?
okay, pedro.

## they killed the president of nova so that manuel pla could take over... and they framed agustin so pla could control intertel, right?
you were a witness.

## why didn't you expose them?
i didn't know what i had.

## whose tape is this?
carlos aribau's.

## have you no shame?
the cops.

## why didn't they catch this?
because i gave them a dub.

## okay?
i kept the original.

## why did you do it?
because...

## okay?
i just took it.

## mr. mcgovern?
i bet you think you're quite the hotshot.

## is there a problem, sir?
you, robinson, and your story.

## what?
as a patsy, to cover up his crimes.

## why didn't you tell me sooner?
i'm a reporter.

## mr. robinson?
i'm sorry.

## what is it?
the police report on agustin's death.

## would you get me another drink, please?
this is for vlps only.

## how did you get in here?
the security guard was female.

## big fan, huh?
he's going to foul.

## if you were going to sit it out, why did you bait me?
you were hungry, out to get a name.

## so, i get my head blown off, and you sit behind your desk?
hank, when you've seen what i've seen, and you've lived what i've lived... then you can judge me.

## quite so, what's the joke?
hank, good to see you.

## what have i been up to?
well, i was shot, chased, nearly killed.

## hank, why don't i get you a drink?
enjoy yourselves.

## how did you know what was in agustin's police report before it was issued?
i have an amazingly good contact in the barcelona police force.

## you're lying.
who?

## am i?
truth is in the eye of the beholder.

## framing agustin?
another obstacle removed.

## why are you doing this?
the internet is dangerous.

## why don't we ask him?
he's one of my guests.

## he's right down there, see?
i believe you've already made his acquaintance.

## so, why don't we join the party?
nobody will suspect me.

## just give me a little time, all right?
okay.

## the plan?
well, i thought i'd finish my puff piece on manuel pla... go down to the local watering hole, get shit faced, and try and get laid.

## so you're going to do nothing?
you're the one that wanted to leave it alone.

## what, nothing to say?
hank, look on the bright side.

## baghdad, say, or kabul?
i'm so sorry, archie.

## any special plans tonight?
those are top secret.

## who's the lucky man?
i'll never tell.

## do i know him?
you'll never get away with this, you know.

## what are you waiting for?
impress me.

## listen, they killed her, okay?
nicola.

## meet me at 7tv, all right?
don't ask.

## listen, is the tape set?
yes, we can broadcast...

## hey, how are you doing?
brechner.

## all right?
i'm afraid not, pal.

## remember joaquim?
a few drops of hydrochloric acid in a glass of beer... problem solved, if you know what i mean.

## nicola?
an injection.

## looks just like a heart attack, don't you think?
very clean.

## the top?
greed.

## so ugly, isn't it, hank?
i may have done the deed, but you sure made it easy.

## why don't you go to hell?
maybe i will.

## what?
good thing your friend pedro called the police... when he saw your impromptu broadcast.

## are you all right?
yeah.

## aribau filmed the whole thing, right?
nobody will suspect me.

## what the hell do you think you've done?
by ruining me, you've only achieved your own destruction, son.

## what was it?
believe nothing of what you hear and only half of what you see.

## can i get my old job back?
i'll think about it.

## the rain's good for the farmers,
huh?

## mr. burmeister?
yeah, burmeister.

## right.
but who's counting, right?

## you wanna hear about my mom and my childhood, is that the kinda shit you're looking for?
if that's why you're here.

## okay.
what do i look like?

## it's not.
so you're here because...?

## got a minute?
uh, in a second.

## this won't keep till confession?
i really need some help with this.

## is it a woman?
i'm so glad you could help me with this.

## i've never done this before, y'know?
well, that would be a good idea, except they're visiting grandma in ohio.

## what about that thing called a job?
that's a depressing thought.

## carl, you need me to call you a cab?
no, i'm not okay.

## you want me to call the police?
i i know you're just trying to help, but spending the rest of the night with a bunch of asshole cops isn't exactly what i need right now.

## huh?
no, sorry.

## you're gonna be okay?
yeah.

## you got a stereo?
well, i got a boom box.

## hey.
you wanna go listen to some music?

## so, do you live in a house or an apartment?
well, this is it.

## you live here alone?
it was my mother's before she died.

## you own it?
it's great.

## water's fine.
what is she, a real estate agent?

## maybe some ice?
water.

## what?
the water.

## do you like water?
i love it.

## and what's your first favorite?
fucking.

## i guess you don't have to worry about that anymore, do you?
i don't think of myself as the kind of person who's in this kind of office.

## what about the woman you mentioned?
right.

## let's just stay focused on the woman, okay?
right.

## and you didn't try to help?
oh, i would have.

## but?
i may have fallen asleep.

## jewel?
i know it was.

## oh oh, that creep in the firebird?
i know that guy.

## what?
we rob you.

## i mean, do you believe that?
i'm shocked.

## i i take it this is something that you you've done before?
just a couple of times.

## how does he know where we are, anyway?
i'm supposed to call him and tell him.

## y'know, i generally think better with my shoes on, so...
you you haven't done that yet, have you?

## this guy utah, is he a mormon?
uh, i wouldn't say that.

## wh why didn't you call?
i was just about to.

## huh?
i got a car...

## oh yeah?
take it off.

## oh, excuse me, okay.
you want me to open it?

## you're the big shot now, i'm nobody, right?
okay, i'm over here now.

## got any other features on this watch?
it's got a stopwatch.

## it's got a stopwatch?
i never figured out how to use it.

## what happened?
he was gonna kill you.

## how?
because i've never actually slept with any of the other guys that i've done this with before, that's how.

## is he dead?
oh, jesus.

## do you hate me now?
it's just the sex and the violence all in one night, it's a little much.

## that's a good idea.
what are we gonna do now?

## yeah?
yeah, really.

## let's come up with another plan.
we'll tell them the truth,

## who?
well, we could say that i shot him.

## he did get shot, right?
right.

## you mean there's another one out there like him?
huh.

## the mormon state?
yeah, right.

## he heard something?
right.

## which was where?
uh...

## hidden next to the safe?
right.

## about what time was this?
his.

## does she have anything to do with it?
let her go.

## sorry.
so this girl, she's good in the sack, huh?

## nice ass?
i'm ironing.

## yeah?
need your signature.

## what's this?
1 800 mattress.

## any further down the line than killing utah together?
you're right... you know what, it's me.

## you what?
i got canned.

## are you okay?
i guess.

## she must have fucked you senseless when she found out you shot a guy?
because i read that women cream for the violence.

## a fountain?
it's gonna be...

## my mistake.
better homes and fountains?

## you know what, carl?
you're not funny just rude.

## why don't you let carl run you home?
no, i'm afraid that's where your luck runs out.

## would you buy a car?
one of these days.

## what's this?
so she said i could borrow it.

## so?
then we're gonna have to buy one.

## you're just afraid because now you don't have an excuse for not finding work, aren't you?
stop right there, this has nothing to do with work.

## god, you're full of shit.
did you know it's safer to fly than it is to drive a car?

## i'm full of shit?
yes.

## i come at a bad time?
uh, no.

## what'd he want?
oh, you know, he's a cop.

## did i... come at a bad time?
there was something about him i just didn't like.

## it was a busy ass night, awright?
you should see what she does with my hose.

## i say a lot of things.
hmm?

## why do you think you did?
i don't know.

## for a barbecue.
the woman?

## no, no, wait a second, what am i thinking?
hot pants.

## i got a guy with a hole in the back of his head where the exit wound was...
it was a dress, like a, like a summer kind of farmer girl dress, you know?

## um, would anybody care for another burger?
yeah.

## you're irresistible?
women... women find me attractive.

## do you think i'm attracted to you?
well, not exactly.

## can we talk?
sure.

## but i am going to the moody blues with him.
what did you do all day?

## what?
i'm doing this for us as a couple, randy.

## huh?
you think i'm gonna have less anger and feel like more of a man if you start dating this guy?!

## and he still owes you six hours overtime, right?
i just don't think he knows what he had with you.

## what?
a rock star.

## really?
really.

## jewel?
the indian stays.

## what are you doing?
jewel, these came from my mom.

## see this one here?
she brought it back from chicago.

## so what kind of job do you have at this point?
i hadn't got one yet.

## i mean, even for montague's.
yeah, jewel and me,

## really?
yeah.

## the burglary?
yeah.

## sure, wouldn't you?
i'll show you what makes me happy.

## you want me to be happy, don't you, randy?
of course i do.

## what's this?
this is the place where it all happens, baby.

## why don't we go downstairs and have a drink?
i have a better idea, baby.

## oh, yeah, you wanna play?
we'll play rough.

## what is it with you?
everywhere you go, there's a dead guy.

## why not?
well, i don't know, it just doesn't seem right.

## it was all right before?
y'know, i never saw a dead person till i met you.

## don't you want to live in the type of house that has a first rate home entertainment center, including a dvd?
i already got his big screen.

## so now i'm a chicken shit, is that it?
you're a genius.

## everything okay, ma'am?
yeah.

## huh?
oh yeah, she had an accident.

## would you mind if i talk to her for a minute?
sure.

## alone?
okay.

## you expect me to just walk away?
don't make me use force, sir.

## that piece of slime?
he didn't deserve her.

## and you did?
i don't know.

## what did he do?
for a living.

## everything okay, ma'am?
yeah.

## would you mind if i spoke to her for a minute?
knock yourself out.

## if i wasn't meant to be with her?
sometimes some time apart is the best thing.

## would i get to stay in the house?
a temporary restraining order would keep him way for... 90 days.

## but permanently?
you'd have to get a lawyer.

## do you know one?
yeah.

## she called you?
yes i didn't call her.

## were you?
yes, you could say that.

## sexual problems?
hey, you know...

## was it your fault?
maybe it was karen's fault.

## was there sex between you and this woman?
yes.

## what?
i need to ask you for a favor.

## you aren't just saying that?

## did she ever call and ask for legal advice?
no.

## how well did you know greg spradling?
uh, not that well, we worked here for the last four or five years.

## so no matter who i'm talking to, she's just she's on my mind.
you were both up for the same promotion, weren't you?

## can you think of anything that might be useful to us in our investigation?
sounds to me like he picked up some rough trade.

## who knows what happened?
there could have been...... leather.

## but we all know what that's like, right?
no sir, i don't.

## and the whip?
yes.

## is it an inside question or an outside question?
there was a burglary last week on winfield road.

## there was sex?
god helpme, it was wonderful.

## are you going to arrest randy?
i've got a warrant out for him now.

## how not perfect can one woman be?

## no, i don't want to talk to the kids.
are you all alone?

## can you just tell them?
don't don't put them on.

## he happens to be my cousin.
what do you mean?

## he's your cousin?
mister, you better take a good long look in the mirror before you call somebody else crazy.

## okay, um, for what?
for murder.

## why are you wearing that?
it was just that one time with me and jewel, i swear.

## what do you mean, one time?

## huh?
no.

## i understand the man that killed my brother, utah, he lives here.
which one of you homos killed my brother?

## i said, which one of you was it!?
i i i'm an attorney.

well, it's a rough neighborhood......

## you have a house?

uh, in a second.

## this won't keeptill confession?
i really need some helpwith this.

## is it a woman?
i'm so glad you could helpme with this.

## i've never done this before, y'know?
well, that would be a good idea, except they're visiting grandma in ohio.

## what about that thing called a job?
that's a depressing thought.

## carl, you need me to call you a cab?
girl:no, i'm not okay.

## you want me to call the police?
i i know you're just trying to help, but spending the rest of the night with a bunch of ass hole cops isn't exactly what i need right now.

## huh?
no, sorry.

## you're gonna be okay?
yeah.

## you got a stereo?
well, i got a boom box.

## hey.
you wanna go listen to some music?

## so, do you live in a house or an apartment?
well, this is it.

## you live here alone?
it was my mother's before she died.

## you own it?
it's great.

## water's fine.
what is she, a real estate agent?

## maybe some ice?
water.

## what?
the water.

## do you like water?
i love it.

## and what's your first favorite?
fucking.

## i guess you don't have to worry about that anymore, do you?
i don't think of myself as the kind of person who's in this kind of office.

## what about the woman you mentioned?
right.

## let's just stay focused on the woman, okay?
right.

## and you didn't try to help?
oh, i would have.

## but?
i may have fallen asleep.

## jewel?
i know it was.

## oh oh, that creep in the firebird?
i know that guy.

## what?
we rob you.

## i mean, do you believe that?
i'm shocked.

## i i take it this is something that you you've done before?
just a couple of times.

## how does he know where we are, anyway?
i'm supposed to call him and tell him.

## y'know, i generally think better with my shoes on, so...
you you haven't done that yet, have you?

## this guy utah, is he a mormon?
uh, i wouldn't say that.

## wh why didn't you call?
i was just about to.

## huh?
i got a car...

## oh yeah?
take it off.

## oh, excuse me, okay.
you want me to open it?

## you're the big shot now, i'm nobody, right?
okay, i'm over here now.

## got any other features on this watch?
it's got a stopwatch.

## it's got a stopwatch?
i never figured out how to use it.

## what happened?
he was gonna kill you.

## how?
because i've never actually slept with any of the other guys that i've done this with before, that's how.

## is he dead?
oh, jesus.

## do you hate me now?
it's just the sex and the violence all in one night, it's a little much.

## that's a good idea.
what are we gonna do now?

## yeah?
yeah, really.

## let's come upwith another plan.
we'll tell them the truth,

## who?
well, we could say that i shot him.

## he did get shot, right?
right.

## you mean there's another one out there like him?
huh.

## the mormon state?
yeah, right.

## he heard something?
right.

## which was where?
uh...

## hidden next to the safe?
right.

## about what time was this?
his.

## does she have anything to do with it?
let her go.

## sorry.
so this girl, she's good in the sack, huh?

## nice ass?
i'm ironing.

## yeah?
need your signature.

## what's this?
1 800 mattress.

## any further down the line than killing utah together?
you're right... you know what, it's me.

## you what?
i got canned.

## aw... are you okay?
i guess.

## she must have fucked you senseless when she found out you shot a guy?
because i read that women cream for the violence.

## a fountain?
it's gonna be...

## my mistake.
better homes and fountains?

## you know what, carl?
you're not funny just rude.

## why don't you let carl run you home?
no, i'm afraid that's where your luck runs out.

## would you buy a car?
one of these days.

## what's this?
so she said i could borrow it.

## so?
then we're gonna have to buy one.

## you're just afraid because now you don't have an excuse for not finding work, aren't you?
stopright there, this has nothing to do with work.

## god, you're full of shit.
did you know it's safer to fly than it is to drive a car?

## i'm full of shit?
yes.

## i come at a bad time?
uh, no.

## what'd he want?
oh, you know, he's a cop.

## did i... come at a bad time?
there was something about him i just didn't like.

## it was a busy ass night, awright?
you should see what she does with my hose.

## i say a lot of things.
hmm?

## why do you think you did?
i don't know.

## for a barbecue.
the woman?

## no, no, wait a second, what am i thinking?
hot pants.

## um, would anybody care for another burger?
yeah.

## you're irresistible?
women... women find me attractive.

## do you think i'm attracted to you?
well, not exactly.

## can we talk?
sure.

## but i am going to the moody blues with him.
what did you do all day?

## what?
i'm doing this for us as a couple, randy.

## huh?
you think i'm gonna have less anger and feel like more of a man if you start dating this guy?!

## and he still owes you six hours overtime, right?
i just don't think he knows what he had with you.

## what?
a rock star.

## really?
the indian stays.

## what are you doing?
jewel, these came from my mom.

## see this one here?
she brought it back from chicago.

## so what kind of job do you have at this point?
i hadn't got one yet.

## i mean, even for montague's.
yeah, jewel and me,

## really?
yeah.

## the burglary?
yeah.

## sure, wouldn't you?
i'll show you what makes me happy.

## you want me to be happy, don't you, randy?
of course i do.

## what's this?
this is the place where it all happens, baby.

## why don't we go downstairs and have a drink?
i have a better idea, baby.

## oh, yeah, you wanna play?
we'll play rough.

## what is it with you?
everywhere you go, there's a dead guy.

## why not?
well, i don't know, it just does n't seem right.

## it was all right before?
y'know, i never saw a dead person till i met you.

## don't you want to live in the type of house that has a first rate home entertainment center, including a dvd?
i already got his big screen.

## so now i'm a chicken shit, is that it?
you're a genius.

## everything okay, ma'am?
yeah.

## huh?
oh yeah, she had an accident.

## would you mind if i talk to her for a minute?
sure.

## alone?
okay.

## you expect me to just walk away?
don't make me use force, sir.

## and you did?
i don't know.

## what did he do?
for a living.

## everything okay, ma'am?
yeah.

## would you mind if i spoke to her for a minute?
knock yourself out.

## if i wasn't meant to be with her?
sometimes some time apart is the best thing.

## would i get to stay in the house?
a temporary restraining order would keephim way for... 90 days.

## but permanently?
you'd have to get a lawyer.

## do you know one?
yeah.

## she called you?
yes i didn't call her.

## were you?
yes, you could say that.

## sexual problems?
hey, you know...

## was it your fault?

## did she ever call and ask for legal advice?
no.

## how well did you know greg spradling?
uh, not that well, we worked here for the last four or five years.

## so no matter who i'm talking to, she's just she's on my mind.
you were both upfor the same promotion, weren't you?

## can you think of anything that might be useful to us in our investigation?
sounds to me like he picked upsome rough trade.

## who knows what happened?
there could have been...... leather.

## but we all know what that's like, right?
no sir, i don't.

## and the whip?
yes.

## is it an inside question or an outside question?
there was a burglary last week on winfield road.

## there was sex?
god helpme, it was wonderful.

## are you going to arrest randy?
i've got a warrant out for him now.

## how not perfect can one woman be?
aces in the boink department.

## like this is supposed to make everything better?
but you gotta admit, that's a beaut.

## you got any idea what they want?
yeah.

## but you'll do it, right?
empty.

## do you think i should?
time's up.

## what?
sorry, time's up.

## he's your cousin?
mister, you better take a good long look in the mirror before you call somebody else crazy.

## okay, um, for what?
for murder.

## why are you wearing that?
it was just that one time with me and jewel, i swear.

## what do you mean, one time?
she never let you touch her.

## huh?

## i understand the man that killed my brother, utah, he lives here.
which one of you homos killed my brother?

## i said, which one of you was it!?
i i i'm an attorney.

## avenging his death, wanting to avenge his death, that's admirable, who doesn't understand that?

well, it's a rough neighborhood......

## you have a house?

where are we going?

## what do we do?
we must cross here, my qu ee n.

## where are they?

## what destiny could i have here?
after the fire, a man will come...... a man as strong as you.

## how can i help you?
we're looking for eyvind the blacksmith.

## what swords have you got?
well, right now, nothing at all.

## meaning that you plan to steal king gunther's property?
just count yourself lucky we aren't offended.

## but why do they care about us?
they n ee d us just as much as we n ee d them.

## but how do we know what they want us to do?
they map out our destinies.

## the christians?
they are a strange lot.

## is this metal the reason you came?
no.

## why?
we were both sent a sign that would bring us together here.

## why don't you stay here with me?
oh, eric, i would love to.

## but where will i find you?
iceland.

## you're the qu ee n of iceland?
yes.

## does that make a difference?
no.

## really?
there have always b ee n things that were different about you.

## why?
maybe the river holds an answer to what happened before you found me.

## is it a war?
it sure looks like that.

## but who's the enemy?
king gunther is at peace with the saxons.

## what is it you want now?
fafnir the dragon is awake.

## why would i put their lives at risk, and mine?
i don't care about the dragon.

## now you want me to believe the hoard is here?
the dragon was sl ee ping on it.

## why would i help you and not k ee p the whole hoard for myself?
we know each other too well, you and i.

## there again, why do things by half?
all right, kriemhild, let it go.

## ready?
go.

## are you sure he'll come back?
of course.

## what's its name?
arminius.

## who are you calling a boy, boy?
i'm the king's brother, and i call common men what i please.

## what's that?
he says i'm no common man, but the tamer of fire and the elements.

## shall we try again?
stop that nonsense, eric.

## the king would be waiting for you to kill the dragon for him?
i can do it.

## aren't you helping me with this?
it's your sword.

## didn't i teach you how to do it?
yes, you did.

## tamer of fire and the elements...... may i enter?
you may.

i don't know.

## why?
a sword as great as this des erve s a name.

## and what's this?
that is the ring of the nibelung.

## what sorcery is this?
give it back.

## who are you?
i should've known better.

## what's to stop me from killing you?
the magical tarnhelm.

## what do i n ee d that for?
i look like me already.

## listen, are you trying to...?
shadows and vapours, all the same.

## are you going to spare me?
go.

## who is he?
his name is alberich, and he was one of us.

## how about we make a bargain?
i'll only take half of the treasure...... you k ee p the rest.

## would that be fair?
half the treasure, all the treasure, or just that single ring.

## the blacksmith?
i have thought of that man ever since.

## are you sure he's strong and brave enough to pass the tests you planned?
he has defeated me once already.

## where have you b ee n?
hunting.

## what does it look like?
it's a dragon's claw.

## where did you find it?
on a dragon's foot.

## if you don't like its claw, how about...... its head?
i don't believe it.

## you don't trust the king?
i trusted him well enough to kill a dragon on his behalf, lord hagen.

## did you?
that was a fair hit, hagen.

## can i s ee your face?
no, that would ruin everything.

## you're baptized?
yes.

## what does a dragon slayer do now that there are no dragons left to slay?
he goes home to his smithy.

high, i think.

## how strong is their army?
four, perhaps, 5000 men.

## what do you have in mind, my king?
my sister will marry siegfried of xanten.

## what do you want?
siegfried means to take the treasure to his father's castle in xanten.

## what do you have in mind?
one of your cantrips, spells or potions.

## if he could forget his other love and find the princess attractive instead?
then the gold stays where it is.

## what do you want?
that boy took something from me.

## father?
father.

## are you sick?
if old age is a sickness, yes.

## can you still call me that?
your true father was a king.

## you knew?
i suspected it.

## yet so far from my arms and my body.
father?

## yes?
my lady kriemhild.

## may i please speak with you?
i wish to be alone, lord hagen.

## what about him?
i expect him back any day.

## what are you implying, hagen?
i have noticed you have f ee lings for him.

## what is that?
certain herbs...... with interesting properties.

## but why?
in battle and in council...... i have always s erve d the house of burgund...... and the best interests of the kingdom.

## what happened?
i can't remember.

## do you believe in destiny?
we were meant to m ee t.

## you're the queen of iceland?
yes.

## does that mak e a difference?
no.

## what sorcery is this?
the magical tarnhelm.

## would i know her?
no.

## what do you have in mind?
one of your cantrips...... spells or potions.

## if he could forget his other love and find the princess attractive instead?
then the gold stays where it is.

## how much farther?
and only you will burn in his heart from that moment on.

## would you join us in a toast before you leave?
this is a special wine of burgund...... mixed with spices.

## where are gunther and hagen?
they left.

## will you make it again for me sometime...... only with less cinnamon?
of course i will.

## what?
at the dragon feast...... you told a masked girl that your heart was already pledged to somebody else.

## where might my raven be?
i'm proud that burgund has won you as brother in law.

## how long do we have to wait then?
it's not that simple.

## and who is this powerful woman?
her name's brunhild, qu ee n of iceland.

## you know her?
yes.

## how could i forget?
she is of extraordinary beauty.

## you said you've met her?
i did.

## but why?
i mistook her for a saxon and wrestled her down.

## how did she react?
she was a little surprised, that's all.

## how?
by fighting her in my stead.

## wouldn't she notice?
not if you wear that magic helmet of yours.

## will you not help him win a qu ee n for himself?
think, siegfried.

## mine?
the treasure is my wedding gift to you.

## giselher, are you insane?
i only wanted to s ee the norse women, the great valkyries who fight like men.

## why didn't you ask me?
i always ask you, and you always turn me down.

## what boy doesn't crave an adventure like this?
sit down.

## s ee over there?
that's orwandil, the giant.

## and s ee there?
the gods sit up there with the holy dead...... and decide what we should do to help them save the world.

## how are we supposed to find out what they want us to do?
they send us signs.

## what happens if we read those signs wrong?
i don't know.

## what about siegfried?
he'll follow us later.

## the dragon slayer doesn't join you?
he's already preparing the ship for our return.

## is that why siegfried didn't recognize me?
there is nothing here.

## where's my tarnhelm?
we're not done with it yet.

## can i help you?
i waited for you.

## or was it the gold?
that has turned many hearts cold before.

## who shall i ask why you loved me then, and you don't love me now?
i didn't.

## does that mean nothing?
that's not how i remember it.

## even though you said you did?
i was a boy then.

## king gunther...... do you take brunhild as your wife and qu ee n?
i do.

## and do you, brunhild...... accept my king as your rightful husband and lord?
i do.

## do you, kriemhild...... take siegfried as your lawful wedded husband?
i do.

## king siegfried...... do you take kriemhild as your lawful wedded wife?
i do.

## would he like to try?
it would be an honour...... qu ee n brunhild.

## what weapons shall we choose then?
weapons that were forged from the same ore...... and have never b ee n crossed.

## what happened?
i was tired.

## why did you leave without me?
siegfried.

## you want me, my strong husband?
i'm waiting.

## what?
or maybe you had b ee n drinking.

## some magical potion to give you strength, perhaps?
my strength...... is a gift from the gods.

## can the man who survived my challenge not survive his own wedding night?
brunhild, stop.

## not as lucky as i am.
wife, are you mad?

## don't you think brunhild's beautiful?
what a question for such a time and place.

## what?
that coldness.

## hear that?
that's thor swinging his hammer.

## giselher...... you don't really believe in all this pagan nonsense, do you?
i do.

## don't the old ways fascinate you?
no, they don't.

## can i speak openly and know you won't tell anyone?
of course.

## what?
siegfried, she won't let me into her bed.

## you'd refuse to help the man who gave you his own sister?
your magic tarnhelm worked for us in iceland, blood brother.

## you are a match for me, are you not?
after all, you defeated me in iceland.

## siegfried?
now you can be my husband.

## where are you going?
to get rid of this pagan witchery.

## do you swear to k ee p this secret?
in iceland, i saw two gunthers too.

## where have you b ee n?
kriemhild.

## why aren't you in bed?
i woke up and you weren't there.

## what's that in your hand?
nothing important.

## why try to hide it?
it's not what you think.

## what for?
that i cannot tell you.

## why not?
i promised not to.

## and what kind of help leaves a woman's belt in your hand?
if i told you, i would be breaking a vow of the utmost secrecy.

## why not?
we have orders from the qu ee n.

## what?
no one may enter the church until the qu ee n of the burgunds does so.

## how dare you order the doors of this place closed to me?
i am the king's own sister.

## and how dare you refer to my husband as lesser than anyone?
he even introduced himself in iceland as gunther's servant.

## what did you say?
you heard me.

## who gave you that?
my husband.

## do you believe me now?
he took it from you last night, in your own bedroom.

## can't it be done any sooner?
i wish...... but we cannot give your brother the impression...... that we leave bearing him ill will.

## what justice can i administer to put this right?
the simple justice laid down in our books of law may not be sufficient.

## but what other use has he made of it?
you've heard the people praise him more than you.

## your downfall?
you said the presence of that hoard...... in my chamber would bring me good.

## but what about me?
i was betrayed by the dragon slayer and by you.

## what would you have me do?
it's very simple.

## king siegfried, shall we ride together?
brother in law.

## may i join you as well?
qu ee n brunhild, please let me talk to you.

## siegfried?
siegfried.

## what are you talking about?
you have done me no other great harm.

## is siegfried not back?
we should leave before dark.

## murderer.
siegfried?

## what reason do i have to kill a man who's done us so much good?
i can't remember.

## do you believe in destiny?
we were meant to meet.

## you're the queen of iceland?
yes.

## does that make a difference?
no.

## what sorcery's this?
the magical tarnhelm.

## would i know her?
no.

## what do you have in mind?
one of your cantrips, spells, potions.

## how much farther?
all he must do, is to drink this, mixed with wine.

## king siegfried, would you join us in a toast before you leave?
this is a special wine of burgund, mixed with spices.

## where are gunther and hagen?
they left.

## will you make it again for me some time, only with less cinnamon?
of course, i will.

## what?
at the dragon feast... you told a masked girl that your heart was already pledged to somebody else.

## will you not help him win a queen for himself?
think, siegfried...

## mine?
i've always asked you, and you've always turned me down.

## what boy doesn't crave an adventure like this?
sit down.

## how do we find out what they want?
they send us signs.

## what happens if we read those signs wrong?
i don't know.

## what about siegfried?
he'll follow us later.

## the dragonslayer doesn't join you?
he is already preparing the ship... for our return.

that's not how i remember it.

## and you never loved me?
even though you said you did.

## and do you, brunhild, accept my king as your rightful husband and lord?
i do.

## do you, kriemhild, take siegfried as your lawful wedded husband?
i do.

## king siegfried, do you take kriemhild as your lawful wedded wife?
i do.

## queen brunhild.
would he like to try?

## what weapons shall we choose then?
weapons that were forged from the same ore and have never been crossed.

## what happened?
i was tired.

## why did you leave without me?
i'm waiting.

## what?
or then again maybe you had been drinking.

## some magical potions to give you strength, perhaps?
my strength is a gift from the gods, and it lies in this belt.

## but it's a hard beauty.
don't you think brunhild's beautiful?

## you've noticed it then... what?
that coldness.

## you hear that?
that's thor, swinging his hammer.

## siegfried.
you don't really believe in all this pagan nonsense, do you?

## i mean...
what's the matter?

## what?
your magic tarnhelm worked for us... in iceland, blood brother.

## you are a match for me, are you not?
after all you defeated me in iceland.

## siegfried?
now you can be my husband.

## where are you going?
to get rid of this pagan witchery.

## why aren't you in bed?
i woke up, and you weren't there.

## what's that in your hand?
nothing important.

## what for?
that i cannot tell you.

## why not?
i promised not to.

## what kind of help leaves a woman's belt in your hand?
if i told you, i would be breaking a vow of utmost secrecy.

## why not?
orders from the queen.

## what?
no one may enter the church until the queen has done so.

## we cannot, lady kriemhild.
are you joking?

## what did you say?
you heard me.

## do you believe me now?
he took it from you last night, in your own bedroom.

## can't we leave immediately?
i wish, but we cannot give your brother the impression that we leave, bearing him ill will.

## what justice can i... possibly administer to put this right?
the simple justice...

## but what other use has he made of it?
you've heard the people praise him more than you.

## you may not care if men scorn you as a weakling and a cuckold.
what's he planning next, my king?

## but what about me?
i was betrayed by the dragonslayer and by you.

## what would you have me do?
it's very simple.

## queen brunhild?
queen brunhild, please let me talk to you.

## siegfried?
siegfried.

## what are you talking about?
you have done me no other greater harm.

## is siegfried not back?
we should leave before dark.

## what happened?
i can't remember.

## do you believe in destiny?
we were meant to meet.

## you're the queen of iceland?
yes.

## does that make a difference?
no.

## what sorcery's this?
the magical tarnhelm.

## would i know her?
no.

## what do you have in mind?
one of your cantrips, spells, potions.

## how much farther?
all he must do, is to drink this, mixed with wine.

## king siegfried, would you join us in a toast before you leave?
this is a special wine of burgund, mixed with spices.

## where are gunther and hagen?
they left.

## will you make it again for me some time, only with less cinnamon?
of course, i will.

## what?
at the dragon feast... you told a masked girl that your heart was already pledged to somebody else.

## where might my raven be?
i'm proud that burgund has won you as brother in law.

## how long do we have to wait then?
it's not that simple.

## and who is this powerful woman?
her name is brunhild.

## you know her?
yes.

## how could i forget?
she's of extraordinary beauty.

## but you said you've met her?
i did.

## but why?
i mistook her for a saxon, and i wrestled her down.

## how did she react?
she was a little surprised, that's all.

## how?
by fighting her in my stead.

## wouldn't she notice?
not if you wear that magic helmet of yours.

## will you not help him win a queen for himself?
think, siegfried... if i marry brunhild, you and kriemhild can be married the very same day.

## mine?
i've always asked you, and you've always turned me down.

## what boy doesn't crave an adventure like this?
sit down.

## the gods sit up there with the holy dead, and decide what we should do to help them save the world... how do we find out what they want?
they send us signs.

## what happens if we read those signs wrong?
i don't know.

## what about siegfried?
he'll follow us later.

## the dragonslayer doesn't join you?
he is already preparing the ship... for our return.

## is that why siegfried didn't recognize me?
there is nothing here.

## where's my tarnhelm?
i'm not done with it yet.

## can i help you?
i waited for you, as i said i would.

## or was it the gold?
that has turned many hearts cold before.

## who shall i ask... why you loved me then, and don't love me now?
that's not how i remember it.

## and you never loved me?
even though you said you did.

## and do you, brunhild, accept my king as your rightful husband and lord?
i do.

## do you, kriemhild, take siegfried as your lawful wedded husband?
i do.

## king siegfried, do you take kriemhild as your lawful wedded wife?
i do.

## would he like to try?
it would be an honour, queen brunhild.

## what weapons shall we choose then?
weapons that were forged from the same ore and have never been crossed.

## what happened?
i was tired.

## why did you leave without me?
i'm waiting.

## what?
or then again maybe you had been drinking.

## some magical potions to give you strength, perhaps?
my strength is a gift from the gods, and it lies in this belt.

## but it's a hard beauty.
don't you think brunhild's beautiful?

## you've noticed it then... what?

i'd like to know what i'm dealing with.

## so you got yourself a member of the crazy folks tribe?
yeah.

## what about...?
yeah, yeah, yeah.

## the stories being so much alike?

you could've killed me, space ranger.

## does anyone know where we might find the al of al's toy barn?

andy's growing up, and there's nothing you can do about it.

## hey, woody, are you in here?
destroy buzz lightyear.

you can be the toy that comes with the meal.

## what makes you so sure?

## i understand, sir.
will you just leave me alone?

## he's got a little sister.
but... what if andy doesn't like me?

## this is bad.
he does?

you're in breach.

## is this about the new pages?
because i made the changes, all the changes you wanted.

## hmm?
it's the biggest on earth.

## what?
eh.

## see?
it's just this.

## see?
look.

## see?
it's lower already.

## do we have everything?
all right.

## you know what?
the difference is you're not creative.

## jack, are you there?
she's good.

## who needs a name?
we'll cast an unknown.

## i'm being difficult?
yes.

## i'm going to tell you why.
elaine, do you know what these are?

## so, what's wrong with that?
elaine, she doesn't have children.

## don't you see?
they're mocking us.

## i mean, we always had movie stars, but they used to be our stars, remember?
we were the ones who would tell them what to do.

## remember?
h ere we go.

## what were we doing?
we were trying to make something important.

## who do you think pays for all of this?
this is about investment and return.

## h e y, dad.
you're not renewing my contract?

## how are you, hone y?
good.

## are you okay?
i'm viktor taransky.

## mr. taransky?
the future of film conference in san jose.

## remember that?
hank.

## what's that?
an e y e.

## you love my movies?
that changed my life.

## i'll call you about it, okay?
that's what i'm trying to say.

## what do you mean she won't work with me?
she's done nothing.

## it was his last wish that you have this.
hello?

## what is it?
no why... just here.

## so, what did you guys think?
so fake.

## who's looking at the sets when she's on screen?
oh, yeah.

## a star like that, who cares about the supporting cast?
congratulations again.

## and the rest of the film, what did you think?
she's a miracle.

## where did you find her?
well...

## you really didn't notice anything unusual about her?
only her brilliance.

## i did?
yeah.

## but who is simone?
we know so little about her.

## and why the secrecy?
good to see you, too, elaine.

## where is she?
she's not here.

## why?
because she would never come to something like this.

## have you read the reviews?
they're love letters.

## why not?
she is somewhat of a recluse.

## is ms. simone coming in today?
she's already here.

## remember, under no circumstances are you or anybody else ever to enter this set without my express permission, understood?
yes, sir.

## what if it catches on fire?
let it burn.

## do you know what this means?
we have stepped into a new dimension.

## is this better, mr. taransky?
much.

## how do i look?
give me audrey.

## how do i look?
perfect.

## are you ever going to tell the truth about me, mr. taransky?
i'm going tell the truth about you.

## why wouldn't i?
of course... with hank's tragic passing, his secret did die with him.

## and what's real anymore?
most actors these days have digital work done to them.

## is this on?
no questions regarding simone.

## are they involved?
they were at one time inseparable.

## and now?
now... sadly to say, only in spirit.

## oh, really?
they're cleaning the engine now.

## really?
yes, really.

## maybe she didn't want you to know, huh?
i strongly sensed that she thought i would be perfect for clyde as well.

## really?
strongly.

## hello?
simone, it's so great to hear from you.

## how are you, sweetheart?
you'll never guess who i'm with.

## what's wrong now?
i'm getting nothing from her side of the conversation.

## you want to go in another direction?
well... we'll try and talk her into it, don't worry.

## what is this, some kind of jamming device?
this is a bad place to talk.

## why would they do that?
well, whatever it is... it's dark.

## dark?
yeah.

## why?
you'll lose yourself in that thing.

## how you gonna meet boys?
dad, i know plenty of boys.

## how do you know you're not talking to some middle aged freak?
dad, i can spot a middle aged freak a mile away.

## what are you doing here?
you're trespassing.

## what are you, holding her hostage?
you're the hostage.

## lainey, don't you ever wonder where i'm really hiding simone?
just as long as i know where you are, dad.

## hey, you want to come in?
hi.

## so she's really going to do all this nudity?
it's on the page.

## hair and make up?
does her own.

## you want her resume?
i'll send it to you.

## what about it?
well, there isn't one.

## h uh?
experience, viktor.

## really?
yeah.

## how will you shoot our love scenes?
body double.

## for her?
for you.

## simone, are you there?
i certainly am, mr. taransky.

## why don't you leave me alone with my co stars, mr. taransky, so we can get to know each other better?
absolutely.

## hi, who's there?
don't be shy.

## is that everyone?
well, obviously, as you know, i'm simone.

## who else?
i just want to start by apologizing for my process.

## but it's worth it, isn't it?
we've done enough work today.

## so how about... you and i going out on the town?
it's simone.

## for me?
yeah.

## how many directors would go to so much trouble to protect an actress?
it's incredible.

## so much like... um, like her?
oh, yes, of course.

## yes?
this is so exciting.

## what did you say?
i said do whatever you do to simone.

## simone?
yes.

## is that a problem?
okay.

## or something.
is something wrong?

## are you bus y tomorrow?
oh, i'm fine, hal.

## how are you?
somebody said she was here.

## come on, where is she?
i don't know.

## not you two.
is that her by the fountain?

## is that what you're telling me?
but this simone woman is good.

## what happened?
well, we have some of taransky's fingerprints, a lot of yours... and none of hers.

## you have one?
i will when you're finished writing it.

## what is this about?
they're in the toilet.

## just us.
simone?

## where is she?
she's gone.

## where are the sets?
god, that is so like her.

## what is all this?
well...

## this is terrible.
what?

## how is she going to plug the film?
yes, indeed.

## live?
please.

## she didn't, by any chance, happen to mention me?
actually, she did.

## really?
yeah.

## viktor, i'd love to, really., but don't you have to go talk to simone?
if i can find her.

## why have you stay ed so completely out of the limelight?
i guess i just think actors talk too much.

## does the world really want to hear my life story just because i have a movie opening on friday?
wow.

## and you don't secretly want the attention?
i'm not even sure i deserve it.

## now, how is that healthy for a performer?
because you have to understand, frank, none of this is real.

## is there a mr. right in there somewhere?
you know, frank, i'd rather not discuss my private life.

## would you like a moment, simone?
no, i'm okay.

## how about the nudity?
i know where that is.

## what exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
i suppose what i like most about the movies i'm in is that they're not about special effects.

## could they have built that hotel since yesterday?
get in the car.

## didn't we have this conversation before?
yeah, web site interviews, no problem.

## and for some reason, this woman leaves no paper trail?
now, i've obtained a copy of your bank account.

## abduction?
yeah.

## what is it exactly that you want?
i want to see her.

## mr. taransky...?
she's...

## she's walking?
you're in breach.

no.

## that's it.
lnhaler?

## so you figured...... by having her car and clothes, she wasn't going anywhere?

that's right.

## why would she want to do that?
well, her husband was beating her up because she wanted to leave him.

yes, that's right.

## and you know what kind of mystery this is?
a kidnapping.

no crime.

pooh bear?

## how can it be the right thing when we're not together?
well, i have to think of my future... and what my family expects of me.

## so you're breaking up with me... because you're afraid your family won't like me?
everybody likes me.

## but i'm seriously in love with you.

## isn't that enough?
pooh bear, just get in the car.

## hear what?

## hey, elle, do you know what happened... on days of our lives yesterday?

## do you think it's acceptable that ms. woods is not prepared?
i don't.

## would you support my decision to ask her to leave class... and to return only when she is prepared?
absolutely.

## now, ms. kensington... did diversity jurisdiction exist in this case?
no, it did not.

## how about in the case of owens vs. mccullogh?
excuse me.

## the professors?
they tend to do that.

## did she do that to you, too?
no.

## who else do you have?
i have callahan, royalton, and levinthal.

## are you a third year?
well hey, elle.

## so... how was your first class?
it was good, except for this horrible preppy girl... who made me look bad in front of the professor.

## so, how was your summer?
good.

## have you met vivian?
hi.

## do you know her?
she's i'm his fiancee.

## what?
it's an emergency.

## bad day?
you can't even imagine.

## what am i supposed to do?
you're asking the wrong girl.

## what's a girl to do?
that's terrible.

## three tits?
she's from connecticut.

## is she as pretty as you?
she could use some mascara and some serious highlights, but... she's not completely unfortunate looking.

## how you doing?
sign here.

## could i have been any more goddamn spastic?
it's ok.

## are you sure this warner guy is, like, the one?
definitely.

## what are you waiting for?
steal the bastard back.

## ms. woods... would you rather have a client who committed a crime... malum in se or malum prohibitum?
neither.

## and why is that?
i would rather have a client who's innocent.

## ms. kensington, which would you prefer?
malum prohibitum.

## it has been said yes, ms. woods?
i changed my mind.

## who is that?
wow.

## hi, everybody.
can she play?

## elle, what are you doing here?
i've come to join your study group.

## who's first?
our group is full.

## is this like an rsvp thing?
no.

## hey, maybe there's, like, a sorority... you could, like, join instead, like?
if you had come to a rush party...

## is that before you voted against me... and then called me a dyke behind my back?
i don't use that word.

## hello?
hey, it's me.

## did you get the rock yet?
almost.

## really?
yes...

## are you having fun?
i am now.

## what's with the costume?
i just decided to dress up.

## but what?
we took the same lsats... and we're taking the same classes.

## so, you've filed a claim.
i'm never going to be good enough for you, am i?

## meaning you need reasonable belief... that your claim should have, like, evidenciary support?
and what kind of evidenciary support...

## are you ready?
no.

## what the hell do you want?
we're eating lunch.

## you just thought you could come here... and show me what i'm definitely not missing?
that's not why i came by.

## how many times you gonna come over here... begging me to take you back, huh?
i was...

## who's asking?
i'm elle woods.

## do you understand what subject matter jurisdiction is?
no.

## come again?
due to the fact that you've retained this residence...

## oh, my gosh, did you see him?
he's probably still scratching his head.

## yes, ms. woods?
although mr. huntington makes an excellent point...

## why this sperm?
i see your point.

## you're applying for my internship, aren't you?
i don't know.

## do you have a resume?
yes, i do.

## don't you think?
see you next class.

## what's that?
it's her resume.

## what's going on?
callahan's firm is defending a murder trial.

## remember when we spent those four amazing hours... in the hot tub after winter formal?
yeah no.

## four hours?
you look very nice today, vivian.

## gold digger?
you'd think so since the stiff was 60... but she was rich on her own.

## are you talking about brooke taylor?
maiden name taylor.

## how?
she can make you lose three pounds in one class.

## by who?
his 26 year old daughter and the pool boy.

## what about the murder weapon?
the gun is missing.

## why would i kill my husband?
insurance, a love affair, pure unadulterated hatred.

## are you one of my lawyers?
sort of.

## how you doing today?
fine.

## is this the only interaction you two have ever had?
no.

## what's the point?
trust me, paulette.

## do you know what i'm saying?
come on.

## like this?
my money is on the angry daughter or the ex wife.

## what about the mother?
covered.

## are you all right?
you look so... orange.

## who could understand better than me?
it's so shameful.

## how?
i've made my fortune on the ability... to perfect women's bodies with brooke's butt buster workout.

## what?
i was getting liposuction.

## anyone you know?
yes.

## what the hell do you mean you went to visit her?
i went to get her alibi.

## did you get it?
it's really good.

## what is it?
oh, i can't tell you.

## why the hell not?
because i promised her i'd keep it a secret... and i can't break the bonds of sisterhood.

## are you crazy?
just tell him the alibi.

## who cares about brooke?
think about yourself.

## so what?
the ex wife seems to be unconcerned... with the fact that her interview is today.

## isn't that like your mothership?
i could go if you want me to.

## emmett?
go with her.

## why?
i mean, this is a person who's made her living... by telling women that they're too fat.

## why would you call me that?
you know, i mean, you just need to have a little more faith in people.

## how do we find her?
i called ahead.

## mrs. windham vandermark?
so you found me.

## do you have any reason to believe that it did?
i've never actually met the woman... but my daughter tells me... she can be quite the little bitch.

## did your daughter ever mention anything... about the relationship between brooke and heyworth?
she did say that they humped like gorillas.

## well... haven't you seen the cabana boy?
she's lying.

## why not?
i'm discriminated against as a blonde.

## how do you think i'd look as a blonde, you know?
i'm not sure you could handle it.

## we spent a beautiful night together... and i never hear from you again?
i...

## sorry for what?
for breaking my heart... or for giving me the greatest pleasure...

## both?
well, forget it.

## so... when did you want to go out?
come in.

## are you done with that deposition yet?
yeah.

## really?
sure.

## did you ever notice how callahan never asks warner... to bring him his coffee?
he's asked me at least ten times.

## what?
his father had to make a call.

## do you want to hold him?
he's very friendly.

## and where was she exactly?
standing over my father's dead body.

## and what was the defendant doing?
she was sitting next to the pool, topless... while the latin boy handed her a drink.

## mr. salvatore, can you tell us what this is?
my uniform.

## have you and mrs. windham had sexual relations?
yes.

## ok?
yes.

## can you sign?
i got it.

## you broke his nose?
i blew it, elle.

## really?
he isn't brooke's lover.

## how do you know he's gay?
gay men know designers.

## know what?
he left a cher tape in the pool house one time.

## mr. salvatore, do you have any proof... that you and mrs. windham were having an affair?
only the love in my heart.

## did you ever take mrs. windham on a date?
yes.

## where?
a restaurant where no one could recognize us.

## how long have you been sleeping with mrs. windham?
you were great.

## really?
yeah, you know, he already had his coffee, but maybe he needs a doughnut.

## do you need any help?
no.

## is everything all right?
you followed your intuition today... and you were right on target.

## have you thought about where you might be a summer associate?
not really.

## you know what competition's really about?
it's about ferocity, carnage.

## are you hitting on me?
you're a beautiful girl.

## what?
maybe you should sleep with the jury, too.

## why?
law school was a mistake.

## what are you talking about?
you earned it.

## callahan did what?
just forget about it.

## what if you're trying to be somebody you are?
the hell with callahan.

## what's the point in staying, paulette?
all people see when they look at me... is blond hair and big boobs.

## did you go in there knowing how to discredit mr. salvatore?
absolutely.

## is he always such an ass?
he's the top defense attorney in the state.

## is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
no, he's an ass that's gonna try.

## he thinks i'm guilty, doesn't he?
that's not what's important.

## if he doesn't trust me, why should i trust him?
ask elle.

## what's going on here?
elle quit.

## what?
callahan hit on her, so she quit.

## what?
i feel terrible.

## what are you so happy about?
you're on trial for murder.

## what?
you're fired.

## who?
excuse you, you're in my way.

## see?
thank you, david.

## mr. callahan?
that i won't agree to.

## mrs. windham, you do realize what you're doing?
absolutely.

## do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth... and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
i do.

## miss windham... when you arrived back at the house... was your father there?
not that i saw, but like i said...

## and when you came downstairs, what happened?
i saw brooke standing over his body... drenched in his blood.

## but mrs. windham didn't have a gun?
no.

## miss windham, did you hear a shot fired?
no.

## because you were in the shower?
i was washing my hair.

## where is she going with this?
have a little faith, gerard.

## miss windham... what had you done earlier that day?
i got up... got a latte, went to the gym... got a perm, and came home.

## where you got in the shower?
i believe the witness has made it clear... that she was in the shower.

## miss windham, had you ever gotten a perm before?
yes.

## how many would you say?
i have a point, i promise.

## because they got wet?
exactly.

## and if in fact you weren't washing your hair... as i suspect, because your curls are still intact... wouldn't you have heard the gunshot?
and if in fact you had heard the gunshot...

## how would you feel if your father married someone who was your age?
i just wanted to say... that you were so brilliant in there.

## really?
yes.

## is there a possibility... that all potentials exist side by side?
have you ever seen yourself through the eyes of someone else that you have become...

## what is reality?
i think the more you look at quantum physics... the more mysterious and wondrous it becomes.

## have you ever thought about what thoughts are made of?
every age, every generation has its built in assumptions

## is everyone an enigma?
they most certainly are.

## isn't it amazing that we have options and potentials that exist... but we're unaware of them?
we've been conditioned to believe... that the external world is more real than the internal world.

## what is reality?
no.

## did you know that the brain imprints what it has the ability to see?
this is important.

## so is it possible our eyes, our cameras... see more than what our brain... has the ability to consciously project?
well, the way our brain is wired up... we only see what we believe is possible.

## you okay?
i heard you scream earlier.

## was it another dream?
you were an indian... watching columbus's ship materialize out of thin air.

## my pills are fine, okay?
thank you.

## so where do they go when they're not here?
now, that question is tricky.

## wanna shoot some hoops?
now, you don't have to be like that.

## how long has it been since you played?
come on.

## how long has it been?
i'll be late.

## what's the matter?
remember, it's empty.

## how do you know this shit?
i read dr. quantum comics.

## the question is, how far down the rabbit hole do you wanna go?
nice shot.

## how can a system or an object be in two or more states at the same time?
it's very easy instead of thinking of things as things.

## what's the big deal?
you can see it right there.

## and yet, there's this completely amazing magic... sitting right in front of your eyes.
oh, well, what does that really mean?

## is this then the observer?
in my modeling, the observer is the spirit... inside the four layer biobodysuit.

## there's no photographer.
where the hell are you?

## or a hot date?
well, the chief of police went on television saying that...

## this leads naturally to wonder do people are people affecting the world of reality that they see?
you betcha they are.

## but hurry, will ya, please?
because these models are giving me a headache.

## makes you wonder, doesn't it?
if thoughts can do that to water... imagine what our thoughts can do to us.

## if you accept with every rudiment of your being... that you will walk on water, will it happen?
yes, it will.

## you see how we are extending the image of ourselves?
sucked.

## me?
the day i make someone sane, they're in trouble.

## it makes you wonder, doesn't it?
if thoughts can do that to water... imagine what our thoughts can do to us.

## is there a substance of thought?
i guess itjust depends on what you think is real.

## guilty.
are all realities in the quantum field existing simultaneously?

## this is a good assignment, if you'd see it that way.
a wedding?

## what's to see?
aw, god, amanda.

## i took the pictures, remember?
you got too many memories clouding your vision.

## you know what?
you need a good polish wedding.

## you mean the priests?
come on.

## how can any one little carbon unit... on earth in the backwaters of... indeed, the milky way, the boondocks... betray god almighty?
that is impossible.

## who is in the driver's seat when we control our emotions or we respond to our emotions?
we know physiologically that nerve cells that fire together wire together.

## does that mean emotions are good or emotions are bad?
no, emotions are designed so that it reinforces chemically... something into long term memory.

## what is it?
mixed.

## got any tips?
you won't do anything, so i will.

## what are you standing there for?
get out and serve.

## so how can anyone really say they're in love with a specific person... for example?
they're only in love with the anticipation... of the emotions they're addicted to.

## my goodness, doesn't that change the landscape... of our emotional outlook on personal needs and identities?
oh, yeah.

## where?
polacks they all look the same in a tux.

## so, what's your name?
hello.

## what do we need?
some foxes.

## hello there, big boy.
now... what about people who are addicted to sex?

## i want to hear some hold on.
is there a rocket in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?

## would you not touch anything?
that's very expensive equipment.

## i want to hear some polka music, okay?
these people want to hear some polka music.

## what happens when we age?
our skin gets loses elasticity.

## what happens to our enzymes?
we don't digest as well.

## what happens to our synovial fluid?
those are proteins that become brittle and stiff.

## what happens to our bones?
they become thin.

## so then the question arises... does it really matter what we eat?
if thoughts can do that to water... imagine what our thoughts can do to us.

## why do you have addictions?
because you have nothing better.

## do i think that you are bad?
i don't think you're bad.

## do i think you're good?
they start to ask those questions.

## what am i addicted to?
hence the human drama.

## you know why that is?
it's because people have set up right and wrong.

## does that mean you're in favor of sin and licentiousness and depravity?
no.

## what is my life?
consciousness of religion is something fundamental.

## have you ever seen yourself... through the eyes of someone else that you have become?
what an initiation.

## have you ever stopped for a moment and looked at yourself... through the eyes of the ultimate observer?
i am much more than i think i am.

## how can we measure the effects?
we get to live our life and see then if somewhere in our lives... something's changed.

## how far down the rabbit hole do you want to go?
ponder that for a while.

## that's always a trick, isn't it?
i should make it clear that i'm a graduate student in physics.

## you're not, like, getting bored with things, are you?
michelle, i...

## is it kinky?
i don't think so.

## i've got the ring, so don't panic, son.

## bro, that's it?
there's no keg anywhere.

## what's that?
we're gonna be ushers at the wedding.

## how was your trip?
delightful.

## who's excited about the wedding?
anxious might be more accurate.

## you brought your sons?
our dogs.

## well, honey, why don't you go get those critters out of the car and we'll start on some cocktails?
ah, thank you.

## so, finch, what are you gonna do with that fancy nyu diploma?
i'll frame it.

## what's up?
that's right.

## oh, cake, huh?

## how are you?
congratulations.

## got lost in the mail, fuckface?
i don't want to discuss this.

## you think he's upstairs, honey?
i know you'll just love him.

## i i i was just trying to get him off, dad.
what are you doing, son?

## that is your son?
i'm thinking about the wedding.

## hey, finch, you want this for here or to go?

we get to have a bachelor party.

## michelle said the wedding was doable, right?
a wedding.

## what's the problem?
dancing.

## what else?
i don't know what else.

## like spying on michelle?
spying is deceitful.

## would you please shut up with that stepping?

## what makes you think you're invited?
i've been looking out for your sex life since high school.

## the stif man showed him the way.

impolite would be an improvement.

## with a dildo show?

## okay?
no pussy, no dancing.

## how's that for polite?
we are talking about getting michelle a dress in chicago.

## these are my people.
hey, finch, what's the capital ofthailand?

how tragic.

## i...
who the hell uses the word deflower?

## how do you explain love?
uh, i i guess i wouldn't know.

## why don't you come in and make yourself comfortable?

## were you pleased with his work?
we were satisfied with the outcome of the litigation.

## mr. laird, when i approached you about being a witness in this trial... you gave sworn testimony in a deposition, is that correct?
that's correct.

## do you recall saying that?
in all honesty, i was delighted... with certain aspects of andy's efforts.

we object.

## did andrew beckett win your lawsuit for you?
get ready.

i guess.

## have you ever felt discriminated against at wyant, wheeler?

no, i wasn't.

## is andrew becket the kind of lawyer who misplaces crucial documents?
not to my knowledge.

absolutely not.

## suddenly counsel's attacking his own witness?

wyant, wheeler aggressively recruited me.

## including charles wheeler?
particularly charles.

## what impressed you about him?
he was the kind of lawyer i thought i wanted to be.

possessed of an encyclopedic knowledge of the law... a razor sharp litigator, genuine leader.

## in the years you worked at wyant, wheeler... did you ever tell charles wheeler you were gay?
no, i didn't.

## why not?
a bitch who knows everything.

no.

## isn't that right?
in some circumstances, yes.

## so you could have infected him, isn't that right?
miguel has not been infected.

## is that correct?
yes.

## you've testified that the lesions on your face... were visible to the people that you worked with, correct?
that's right.

## is that correct?
as painful as it is... to accuse my former colleagues... of such reprehensible behavior... it is the only conclusion i could come to.

## do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
one here... right by my ear.

## your honor, may i approach the witness?
yes, you may.

## remembering that you're under oath... answering truthfully... can you see the lesions on your face in this mirror... from three feet away?

## why did you give him... opportunity after opportunity?
well, when you groom someone... the way we groomed andy, nurturing him...

## you are the greatest.
mr. miller?

## are you gay?
objection.

## you?

i'm not going back.

just like on saturday.

## reverend sykes, are you going upstairs?
yes, i am.

## did anybody call a doctor, sheriff?
no, sir.

## why not?
well, i didn't think it was necessary.

## in what way?
well, she was beaten around the head.

## which eye?
let's see.

## that was her left, facing you... or looking the way that you were?
oh, yes, that would make it her right eye.

## which side again, heck?
the right side.

## well... all around her neck, at the back of her throat?
i'd say they were all around.

## do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
i do.

## would you mind if i just, uh, ask you a few questions, mr. ewell?
no, sir, mr. finch, i sure wouldn't.

## did you, during all this running, run for a doctor?
there wasn't no need to.

## do you agree with his description of mayella's injuries?
i agree with everything mr. tate said.

## now, mr. ewell, can you, uh... can you read and write?
yes, sir, mr. finch, i can read and i can write.

## so what's so interesting?
you're left handed, mr. ewell.

## what's that got to do with it, judge?
you got to watch tricky lawyers like atticus finch!

## do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
sit down, please.

## now, mayella... suppose you tell us just what happened, huh?
well, sir...

## who done it?
thank you, mayella.

## i mean, is he easy to get along with?
does tolerable.

yes.

## didn't you ever ask him to come inside the fence before?
i might have.

## can you remember any other occasion?
no.

## do you remember him beating you about the face?
no.

## tom, will you stand up, please?
let miss mayella have a good long look at you.

mr. finch, i was going home as usual that evening.

## what did you say then?
well, i said something like...

## tom?
you've sworn to tell the whole truth.

## he said he's gonna kill her.
will you do it?

## tom, did you rape mayella ewell?
i did not, sir.

## did you harm her in any way?
i did not, sir.

## strong enough to choke the breath out of a woman and sling her to the floor?
i never done that, sir.

## how come you so all fired anxious to do that woman's chores?
looks like she, she didn't have nobody to help her.

## with mr. ewell and seven children on the place?
you're a mighty good fella, it seems.

## did all that for not one penny?
yes, sir.

## you felt sorry for her?
to begin with, this case should never have come to trial.

## but what was the evidence of her offense?
tom robinson, a human being.

tuesday night.

## but will they stop those damn greasers raiding us?
no, mayor tate, i will.

## do we get a detachment of cavalry?

## and if they don't come?
don't sell the army short.

## why don't we find some amusement?
thanks, pal.

## what buffalo pit did he come out of?
that'll cover it.

## you get the rest when i come back, ok?
honey, we were just getting started.

## what?
he came to get our cannon.

## where's your man?
here.

## what's she got to do with cordoba?
he has a great weakness.

## why do you want to do that?
because...

## are you satisfied?
no.

## why?

## that doesn t surprise you?
at least it explains the secrecy.

## what report?
ulf.

## you want to come with me?
oh, boy.

## so you re saying this spacecraft crashed 300 years ago?
288.

## you think this is an alien spacecraft?
lt s not impossible.

## nowadays, the little green men say,  take me to your therapist ?
listen up.

## l m sorry, are these parameters correct?
that s right.

## there s no way this coral could ve grown faster than an inch a year?
that s what we re going there to see.

## harry, that s a joke, right?
this is the greatest scientific discovery since copernicus.

## you don t want to see that?
i got to say that i resent this briefing very much.

## lf norman s report calls for a biologist, a mathematician...... an astrophysicist and a psychologist...... why are you here?
physical protocols start in a half an hour.

## you always wear glasses?
i just started wearing these.

## are the glasses a problem?
i don t actually need them.

## do you take prescription medication?
no.

## none at all?
once in a while sometimes i might take like a...... a piece of xanax or something if l m nervous.

## we okay?
we re in the river now.

## what river?
lt s a temperature/ salinity differential.

## you okay?
right now, l m not okay.

## would you please not touch me?
we re both nervous.

## would you cut that out, please?
you re having a stress reaction.

## those noises we re hearing, that s normal?
those noises are the water pressure attacking the sub s integrity.

## you know a little something about that, don t you, norman?
how the pressure can attack your integrity.

## that s the helium.
were you nice last time?

## was i the only one paying attention?
oxygen is a corrosive gas, in the same family as fluorine and chlorine...... hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid.

## can you run that by me again, ted?
i don t speak balloon.

## what?
that s my voice.

## ls that the door?
yeah, we used sonar imaging to pinpoint it before the divers went down.

## how tall is that robot?
five feet.

## and it s roughly the same size as an airplane door, isn t it?
excuse me, ted.

## tell them our team is in place and ready, okay?
this is habitat to navy dive.

## why do you say that?
we assume they il be green...... or insect like, but basically human.

## but why would you assume that a ulf would want to kill us?
an immortal creature wouldn t think killing was right or wrong.

## you did put that in your report?
lt s in there.

## what if you have to go to the bathroom?
just go down your leg, ted.

## you can urinate in these?
you can.

## where s the switch?
that s where we re going.

## ls that normal?
just use your equalizer.

## ls that supposed to make me feel good, beth?
this is our air lock.

## that's not budging, is it?
turn it at 45 degrees.

## can you get the suction cup flat to the plane of the door?
maybe it s the hydraulics.

## what is it, harry?
take a look.

## so what?
l thought you said this thing wasn t damaged when it crashed...... that this titanium alloy was so super strong, you can t hurt it.

## ls there heat coming off this thing?
you re right.

## how did that happen?
l m not sure about the atmosphere.

## time to turn back?
l m a little curious.

## split up?
he s got a point.

## you made up the report?
no, not all of it.

## who did the other half?
i borrowed from, you know, good writers.

## rod serling?
who would ve thought anyone even reads those government reports.

## you know?

my god, it s an american spaceship.

## you sure?
this is barnes, norman.

## what the hell is it?
whatever it is, it seems to be what this bird was designed to do.

## yeah, but back from where?
don t get too excited, ted.

## what do you mean?
when pope benedict asked giotto to prove his worth as an artist...... giotto drew a perfect circle...... freehand.

## something put this thing out there to get picked up and brought back here.
what s that?

## have you forgotten the trojan horse?
it could be a trap.

## don t you think that s a little paranoid?
no, l m going to put a video camera on this thing and keep an eye on it.

## yeah, it appears to be mercury, doesn t it?
except mercury s liquid at this temperature.

## what do you think it is?
i don t know.

## why wasn t it damaged?
the materials are obviously super strong.

## lf that s true, why did it chip when you hit it?
it didn t crash.

## from where?
not  where.  when.

## so you re saying this thing took a wrong turn?
that s right.

## i mean, what if the craft...... inadvertently flew into a black hole?
lt s possible, but not plausible.

## what part of  pull out  don t you understand?
extraction.

## you re leaving a time traveling spacecraft at the bottom of the ocean?
l m just following my orders.

## what s your point?
my point is, l m a biochemist and there s no life down here.

i don t know.

## do you not have an opinion about this?
l m delighted we re going back up top.

## you know what i mean?
let s go home.

## you mean, wrong about the storm?
no, about the sphere.

## what about the sphere?
lt s alive.

## why do you say that?

## how can there be anything inside it?
there s no door, no seams.

## doesn t that seem like the actions of a conscious being to you?
pop psychology.

## you really think so?
i don t know.

## ted did figure it out first, didn t he?
good shrinkage.

## what?
you see, it s curious.

## why don t they know?
lf they don t know...... it means we never told anyone.

## what s wrong?
talk to mr. barnes.

## where is he?
video feed room.

## where is that?
i don t know where the hell anything is.

## what s going on?
i don t know.

## what the hell is he doing?
i don t know.

## do you know what he s doing?
i need to know what you know.

## he said,  inside.  what? lnside the spacecraft?
i think inside the sphere.

## did he go inside?
i don t think so.

## what the hell s going on?
he didn t just disappear.

## where are beth and ted?
norman, this is not a triage situation.

## ls he alive?
we lost video here.

## can you hear me?
that tears it.

## what, sir?
we re on internal power.

## what did he say?

the whole food thing was all a diversion.

## and you don t?
norman, you ve known me since i was 17 years old.

## this doesn t have anything to do with your competitiveness with harry?

## troy?
leave digger out of this.

## anything else, harker?
yes, sir.

## did you receive that file, sir?
i don't remember seeing it.

## muir?
i believe it is, sir, and it would behoove mr. muir...... to tell us exactly what $282, 000 has bought him there.

## muir?
it's kind of difficult to explain.

## what the hell is that?
harker, let me see that.

## aiken, where did you leave off yesterday?

## quitting once wasn't good enough?
it's in the blood.

## i always looked forward to getting these.

## cattle drive mobile log cabins.

## yeah, why not?
just some old stuff... that adcox gave me that the department was gonna throw out.

## what do you want, brian?
i wanna know why you messed with my station assignment.

## and that's just not fucking good enough.
i mean, does this really have to be... one of those big brother, little brother... you broke my g. i. joe and i'm still pissed games?

## you know something?
i musta told myself a million times...

## you know how i felt?
i gotta do this, stephen.

## know him?
yeah.

## where's the second in companies, huh?
i don't know.

## is she going to be all right?
i'm afraid you're a little too late with this one.

## you didn't get burned, did you?
look, i'm a little busy right now.

## that stephen, man.
what was that bullshit with the standpipe?

## what goes through that guy's head?
never wears his mask.

## is that an accident or arson?
people are asking me.

## hey, swayzak?
you missed it.

## know that little glow that's starting to blink in the corner of your eye?
that's your career dissipation light.

## alderman, will this affect your task force findings?
no more today.

## did you check those out?
they're like fucking butter.

## do you have to do that?
yeah.

## could you believe that fire?
there we were, adcox and me... pulling that lady right out of the fire's fucking throat.

## you'll see.
you see how he took that fire?

## you think he made that little gem up?
come on.

## thank you, santos.
you got something against dalmatians?

## did i mention you were cut out of my will?
first, to tim.

## i'll see you tonight, huh?
yeah, i'll see you tonight.

## i gotta say, he was just as ugly then.
they had fire engines then?

## can i have a beer, please?
hey.

## hey, 17, what's going on?
well...

## what's this?
brian, this is my boss, alderman swayzak.

## see that?
i've been checking you out.

## why is that?
i want someone from a real traditional fire fighting clan.

## can't you see that?
i'm trying to be a fireman, not some kind of poster boy for swayzak.

## what about?
it's about sean.

## right here, right now, you wanna talk about sean?
wait a second.

## hey, hey, i'm fine.
come on, eh?

## do you ever wonder why... you're stuck a fucking lieutenant for life?
no.

## you okay?
yeah, i'm all right.

## what'd he say?
i don't remember.

## huh?
he doesn't know shit about what i want.

## why don't they trust me anymore, huh, brian?
really, the guys just don't trust me anymore.

## hey, this boat could be great, don't you think?
yeah.

## roll that hose by myself?
you heard me.

## what about tim?
aw, shit.

## what about tim?
for christ's sake.

## i'm not gonna quit, stephen.
you got a problem with drilling, probie?

## you hear me?
we gotta wait for a hose team.

## man, that was pretty crazy, huh?
i waited.

## he tell you that in a fucking seance, huh?
you said you needed to know something.

## what if there had been another kid up there?
oh, i don't know.

## time to move on?
you're right.

## hey, brian?
brian.

## correct?
yes, sir.

## that's what it was?
yes, sir.

## was that before or after you noticed... you were standing in a lake of gasoline, you idiot?
before, sir.

## yeah?
brian mccaffrey, your new assistant.

## why don't you go find a corner to hide in?
i'll get to you later.

## you still standing there?
i think we should get something straight here now.

## who's that?
he works for me.

## is he a fireman?
your dad did.

## who the hell is this guy?
nah, put it away.

## he lost his dad to the animal and... you didn't even tell him who he was coming to see?
tell him.

## what'd you do?
never proved.

## except, he didn't see this big tub of phosphorous, did you?
explosion lit him up so bright, left his shadow on the wall.

## still shy about rolling up your sleeves, shadow?
show him your stomach.

## dr. norris?
as supervising psychiatrist, i would describe...

## mr. bartel, do you regret your crimes?
yes, and and i'm aware of the pain that i have caused.

## if released, will you commit these crimes again?
no.

## do you consider yourself ready for society?
yes, i do.

## remember who it belonged to?
mm hmm.

## what did you do to that little girl?
it's not fair, shadow.

## what did you do to that little girl?
i burned her.

## what do you do to old ladies, ronald?
burn them.

## what would you like to do with the whole world?
burn it all.

## hey, mccaffrey, need a special invitation?
come on.

## what do you want me to do with this?
shhh.

## so it was on both doors?
yeah.

## mccaffrey, why don't you come over and help us?
no, i don't think so.

## you see that patch of shirt right there?
we wondered about the discoloration.

## what was it?
ah, trychtichlorate.

## what was it doing in the fire?
you've gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.

## so what's going on, stephen?
you only bang on the roof when you got something on your mind.

## how's brian doing?
he's out.

## he just up and quit for no reason?
i don't care what you heard, helen, i treated him better... than any other probie i ever had.

## all right?
he probably hates my guts... but at least he finally took a look in the mirror.

## why?
because i'm the first to admit it when i'm wrong.

## i'm telling ya, maybe not today, maybe not next year ; but it would have happened.
yeah?

## all right?
he's my brother.

## yeah?
take the top off.

## who?
the killer.

## what reason?
why backdrafts.

## a torch with a conscience?
no.

## it's arson, right?
i'm not calling anyone yet.

## you mean mine?
well, not yet.

## who is that?
larry dewaay.

## larry, how are ya?
hey.

## how's the job going?
okay.

## yeah? ls rimgale getting any better?
rimgale's rimgale.

## doing his job?
he hasn't done anything.

## will you get me out of here?
otherwise i'm gonna have to go and pick her up.

## what do you think?
it's homey.

## impressive, huh?
yes, it's very nice.

## see those doors?
they lead to the hay loft when they used to have the old horse drawn engines.

## do you miss it?
you seem like you do.

## then why'd you quit?
i should have said i wanted to be a good one.

## where is it?
yeah.

## let's catch it before it breaks out.
how do we know if the floor's gonna be on fire?

## you want to learn something?
yeah, i do.

## what time is it, anyway?
all right, take it.

## get that stretcher over here.
check that door for heat, tim?

## how'd it happen?
breathe, tim, breathe.

## how is he?
he's alive.

## is he gonna make it?
they're not saying.

## this part of your investigation?
you had to do it.

## is that what happened?
i had that fire.

## don't you have any leads?
no, marty, i don't.

## holcomb?
it's a goddamn list.

## i didn't know the name of that victim had been released?
hey, john.

## in a word, brian, what is this job all about?
fire.

## do you know what you're asking?
yeah.

## stephen?
i'm sorry, helen.

## well, what's wrong?
it used to be real clear.

## it holds everything up, doesn't it?
loyalty.

## it's all the same... piece of shit without that, isn't it?
it's the end of everything.

## you sure you really want to put grape jelly in the eggs?
yeah, it's part of my formula.

## it's an experiment?
yeah.

## can you do it?
that's good.

## you gonna leave the shells?
yeah.

## they're part of the formula?
yeah.

## stephen, can i talk to you a minute?
yeah.

## all right?
mom's crying.

## marty?
jesus christ, marty.

## what's going on?
we have a city planners meeting in 15 minutes.

## is there something about these deaths you're not telling me?
no.

## what's this?
just take it.

## what do you mean?
i drove it, joe.

## why did he go through this trouble to cut firehouses?
when a firehouse closes, swayzak converts it into a community center.

## lakeside dynamics, remember them?
they get all the expensive construction work.

## mr. swayzak?
gas.

## that's quite a bunch of guys, huh?
i'm so goddamn helpless here.

## what do you want me to do?
we're close.

## it's a collectible.
it must've looked like it was going to be... a medium deal, didn't it, when your father bought it?

## who's doing this, ronald?
wrong question.

## it isn't a spark, is it?
because there isn't enough damage... and he wouldn't have had any fun.

## how does he talk to the fire?
the outlets.

## you still haven't put it together?
i have.

## you wanna know who?
i wanna know... if this kid really wanted to be... just like his dad.

## did he?
it did.

## so... whoever did this, really knows the animal well, don't they?
they know him real well but they won't let him loose.

## that wasn't such a long walk after all, was it?
oh, god.

## i mean, where you going?
look, i gotta i gotta get back.

## what do you gotta do?
look at you.

## you know something, brian?
that's all right.

## what was i supposed to do?
you tell me.

## what's going on with you?
i don't know.

## do you?
i gotta go.

## has stephen gotten back yet?
he just pulled up.

## what were they doing on the boat?
they're cleaning shit.

## are you a part of this?
no.

## you're sure?
yeah.

## where's 17?
17's on the roof.

## you set me up with those chemicals?
stephen.

## i should've let you in on it.
you burned people!

## in on murder?
that was an accident.

## why'd you have to go in there so fucking early?
that's why you wanted me to wait.

## what would he say about what you do?
swayzak.

## what the fuck would you do?
yeah.

## you all right?
uh huh.

## what?
let's move it.

## brian?
you are, stephen.

## you hear me?
police.

## you see that glow flashing in the corner of your eye?
that's your career dissipation light.

## got it, cap?
okay, into the truck.

## perhaps you would like to hear the tale?
it begins on a dark night... where a dark man waits with a dark purpose.

## you have it then?
i had to slit a few throats, but i got it.

## jeez, where'd ya dig this bozo up?
shh.

## who disturbs my slumber?
it is i, gazeem, a humble thief.

## what are we gonna do?
we got a big problem here, a big...

## you think that was easy?
you two, over that way, and you, follow me.

## getting into trouble a little early today, aren't we, aladdin?
trouble no way.

## huh?
on his way to the palace, i suppose.

## you're not leaving so soon, are you?
good luck marrying her off.

## you were just playing with that overdressed, self absorbed prince achmed, weren't you?
dearest, you've got to stop rejecting every suitor who comes to call.

## hmm?
i don't know where she gets it from.

## uh, my ring?
but it's been in the family for years.

## now, run along and play with your little toys, hmm?
yes.

## would the lady like a necklace?
a pretty necklace for a pretty lady.

## hello hello?
oh, you must be hungry.

## pay?
no one steals from my cart.

## i've been looking all over for you.
do you know what the penalty is for stealing?

## what are you doing?
just play along.

## you, uh, know this girl?
sadly, yes.

## tragic, isn't it?
but no harm done.

## how are you?
no, no, no.

## with all due respect, your rottenness, couldn't we just wait for a real storm?
save your breath, lago.

## let's have the guards extend him an invitation to the palace, shall we?
swell.

## is it that obvious?
well, you do kind of stand out.

## is this where you live?
yep.

## the palace looks pretty amazing, huh?
oh, it's wonderful.

## what does it matter?
i ran away and i am not going back.

## really how come?
abu says, uh... that's not fair.

## oh, did he?
yeah, of course.

## and does abu have anything else to say?
my father must have sent them...

## do you trust me?
yes...

## what are you doing outside the palace?
and with this street rat.

## jafar?
oh, princess.

## how may i be of service to you?
the guards just took a boy from the market, on your orders.

## what was his crime?
i can't breathe, jafar.

## what do you mean?
sadly, the boy's sentence has already been carried out.

## what sentence?
death.

## so, how did it go?
i think she took it... rather well.

## i'm a street rat, remember?
and there's a law.

## who are you?
a lowly prisoner, like yourself.

## jafar, can you hurry up?
but the law says only a prince can...

## you've heard of the golden rule, haven't you?
whoever has the gold makes the rules.

## why would you share all of this wonderful treasure with me?
i need a young pair of legs and a strong back to go in after it.

## so... do we have a deal?
oh, i don't know.

## who disturbs my slumber?
uh, it is i, aladdin.

## abu, what are you, crazy?
giving you your reward.

## i... where is it?
oh, dearest.

## what's wrong?
jafar has... done something terrible.

## what's your name?
uh...

## do you smoke mind if i do?
oh, sorry, cheetah.

## do i look different?
wait a minute.

## i'm your master?
that's right.

## whoa.
what would you wish of me?

## wish fulfillment?
ah, almost.

## like?
some all powerful genie.

## and you're walking out on me?
i don't think so, not right now.

## jafar.
jasmine?

## okay, you marry the princess, all right?
and, uh, then you become the sultan.

## well, how about that, mr. doubting mustafa?
oh, you sure showed me.

## dost mine ears deceive me?
three you are down by one, boy.

## me?
no one's ever asked me that before.

## what?
no, i can't.

## you're a prisoner?
it's all part and parcel of the whole genie gig.

## what do you need?
poof.

## what do you need?
poof.

## what do you need?
to be my own master.

## but what am i talking about?
let's get real here.

## why not?
the only way i get outta this is if my master wishes me out.

## what is it you want most?
well, there's this girl.

## i can't make anybody fall in love, remember?
oh, but, genie, she's smart and fun and...

## pretty?
beautiful.

## hey, can you make me a prince?
let's see here.

## is that an official wish?
say the magic words.

## what are we trying to say, beggar?
no.

## what does it say to me?
it says mode of transportation.

## the problem with your daughter.
what do you need?

## oh, really?
right here.

## how could i choose someone she hates?
not to worry, my liege.

## what who?
the royal vizier.

## what what is that?
oh, much farther than you've traveled, i'm sure.

## what makes him think he is worthy of the princess?
your majesty, i am prince ali ababwa.

## standing around deciding my future?
i am not a prize to be won.

## what am i gonna do?
jasmine won't even let me talk to her.

## what?
tell her the...

## how do i look?
like a prince.

## who's there?
it's me, prince ali.

## so, how's our little beau doing?
good kitty, take off.

## do i know you?
uh, no.

## the marketplace?
i have servants who go to the marketplace for me.

## uh, princess jasmine?
you're very...

## punctual?
buzz off.

## what?

no, so i can pull you up.

## what does your heart say?
i don't know.

## where is it?
i gave it to shaggy and scooby.

## cotton candy glob?
yes.

## i wonder if there's a liter sized soda glob anywhere?
scoob...

## do you know the identity of the evil masked figure behind it all?
if our hunch is correct, the evil masked figure is...

## you almost had me there, didn't you?
lucky for her, she had an assistant helping her with her evil plans.

## but why did she do it?
because heather jasper howe is actually...

## but how do you know this?
of course, dummkopf.

## can we get your photo in this?
yes.

## what is it, charlie?
dad found it, just the piece i needed.

## what piece was it?
a head for willy wonka.

## think so?
i know so.

## you did?
i did.

## yeah?
we need more wonka bars...

## birds?
birds.

## did you know he invented a new way of making chocolate ice cream...... so that it stays cold for hours without a freezer?
you can even leave it lying in the sun on a hot day, and it won't go runny.

## you mean, prince pondicherry?
it will have 1 00 rooms, and everything will be made of either dark or light chocolate.

## did you get your job back?
no.

## have you ever seen a single person...... going into that factory or coming out of it?
no.

## but then, who's running the machines?
nobody knows, charlie.

## hasn't someone asked mr. wonka?
nobody sees him anymore.

## wouldn't it be something, charlie, to open a bar of candy...... and find a golden ticket inside?
i know, but i only get one bar a year, for my birthday.

## augustus, how did you celebrate?
i eat more candy.

## can you spell that for us, please?
v e r u c a. veruca salt.

## where's my golden ticket?
i want my golden ticket.

## dragonflies?
but wait, this is just in.

## and how did it taste?
oh, well, the toothpaste factory thought they'd give me a bit of time off.

## like summer vacation?
sure.

## you sure you want to spend your money on that?
of course i'm sure.

## grandpa?
you fell asleep.

## which end should we open first?
just do it quick, like a band aid.

## did you see that some kid in russia found the last golden ticket?
yes, it was in the paper this morning.

## are you crazy?
i'd give him $500 for that ticket.

## you wanna sell me your ticket for $500, young man?
that's enough of that.

## take it straight home, you understand?
thank you.

## who is going with charlie to the factory?
i will.

## don't you think you ought to go?
well, grandpa joe seems to know more about it than we do, and....

## are you a dummy?
no, sir.

## do you think mr. wonka will recognize you?
hard to say.

## and who am i?
i was worried it was getting a little dodgy in the middle part, but then that finale....

## who are you?
he's willy wonka.

## really?
good morning, starshine.

## i couldn't very well watch the show from up there, now, could i, little girl?
mr. wonka, i don't know if you'll remember me...... but i used to work here in the factory.

## were you one of those despicable spies who tried to steal...... my life's work and sell it to parasitic, copycat, candy making cads?
no, sir.

## don't you want to know our names?
can't imagine how it would matter.

## mr. wonka?
sure is toasty in here.

## what?
i have to keep it warm in here.

## who are the workers?
all in good time.

## moms and dads.
well, you're just lucky to be here, aren't you?

## papa?
okay, then.

## would you like some chocolate?
sure.

## then why is the door so small?
that's to keep all the great big chocolatey flavor inside.

## what?
oh, yeah, it's very beautiful.

## and do you like my meadow?
try some of my grass.

## you can eat the grass?
of course you can.

## why not start a new piece?
because then i wouldn't be a champion.

## what is it?
it's a little person.

## are they real people?
of course they're real people.

## oompa loompas?
lmported, direct from loompaland.

## the oompa loompas.
what?

## what are they doing?
i do say, that all seemed rather rehearsed.

## where does that pipe go to?
that pipe, it just so happens to lead...... directly to the room where i make delicious...... strawberry flavored, chocolate coated fudge.

## they'll be selling him by the pound all over the world?
no.

## can you imagine augustus flavored, chocolate coated gloop?
no one would buy it.

## i want you to take mrs. gloop up to the fudge room, okay?
help her find her son.

## mr. wonka?
exactly the same.

## are the oompa loompas really joking?
of course they're joking.

## what's so funny?
i think it's from all those doggone cocoa beans.

## hey, by the way, did you guys know that chocolate contains a property...... that triggers the release of endorphins?
gives one the feeling of being in love.

## you're all quite short, aren't you?
well, yeah.

## know why?
because i distinctly remember putting a hat on top of my head.

## do you even remember what it was like being a kid?
oh, boy, do l.

## do l?
in fact, willy wonka hadn't thought about his childhood for years.

## what is it, charlie?
dad found it, just the piece i needed.

## what piece was it?
a head for willy wonka.

## think so?
i know so.

## you did?
i did.

## yeah?
we need more wonka bars...

## birds?

because i distinctly remember putting a hat on top of my head.

## do you even remember what it was like being a kid?
oh, boy, do l.

## do l?
ruthie, veronica, terrance.

## and who's that under the sheet?
little willy wonka.

## now...... iet's see what the damage is this year, shall we?
caramels.

## they'd get stuck in your braces, wouldn't they?
lollipops.

## mr. wonka?
we're headed for a tunnel.

## how can they see where they're going?
they can't.

## what do you use hair cream for?
to lock in moisture.

## okay?
go on.

## hey, mr. wonka, what's this?
let me show you.

## lsn't that neat?
it's like gum.

## who wants a beard?
well...... beatniks, for one.

## can you dig what i'm laying down?
you look great.

## you mean that's it?
it's gum.

## know why?
because this gum is a full three course dinner all by itself.

## why would anyone want that?
it will be the end of all kitchens and all cooking.

## that part.
how is it, honey?

## what's happening to her nose?
it's turning blue.

## what do you mean?
violet, you're turning violet.

## what's happening?
well, i told you i hadn't quite got it right.

## what's happening to me?
she's swelling up.

## how is she supposed to compete?
they're gonna squeeze her.

## why did you decide to let people in?
so they could see the factory, of course.

## what's the special prize, and who gets it?
the best kind of prize is a surprise.

## will violet always be a blueberry?
no.

## if you hate gum so much, why do you make it?
once again, you shouldn't mumble.

## can you remember the first candy you ever ate?
no.

## these flashbacks happen often?
increasingly...... today.

## are you using the havermax 4000 to do your sorting?
no.

## why not use oompa loompas?
because only squirrels can get the whole walnut out almost every single time.

## see how they tap them with their knuckles to make sure it's not bad?
oh, look.

## mr. wonka, how much do you want for one of these squirrels?
name your price.

## little girl?
veruca, come back here at once.

## little girl?
don't touch that squirrel's nuts.

## what are they doing?
where all the other bad nuts go.

## where does the chute go?
to the incinerator.

## oh, really?
oh, good.

## how do you know, mr. smarty pants?
this isn't just an ordinary up and down elevator, by the way.

## why is everything here completely pointless?
candy doesn't have to have a point.

## and we certainly don't want that, now, do we?
television chocolate.

## why can't i send a real bar of chocolate through the television, ready to be eaten?
i'm not gonna touch it.

## it's gotta be real big because you know how on tv...... you can film a regular size man, and he comes out looking this tall?
same basic principle.

## do you have any idea what breakfast cereal's made of?
it's those little curly wooden shavings you find in pencil sharpeners.

## but could you send it by tv if you wanted to?
of course i could.

## well, why would i wanna send a person?
they don't taste very good at all.

## don't you realize what you've invented?
it's a teleporter.

## what do you mean?
well, sometimes only half of the little pieces find their way through.

## what kind of a question is that?
no need to snap.

## what are you talking about?
just put me back in the other way.

## and what exactly do you propose to do about it?
i don't know.

## taffy puller?
hey, that was my idea.

## i want you to take mr. teavee and his...... iittle boy up to the taffy puller, okay?
stretch him out.

## now, how many children are left?
mr. wonka, charlie's the only one left now.

## you mean, you're the only one?
yes.

## what happened to the others?
oh, my dear boy, but that means you've won.

## what kind of room is that?
hold on.

## break through what?
i've been longing to press that button for years.

## but do you really mean?
yeah.

## where do you live?
right over there.

## what time do you think they'll be back?
yeah.

## who would watch over them after i was gone?
i must find a heir.

## what are oompa loompas?
i invited five children to the factory...... and the one who was the least rotten would be the winner.

## are you ready to leave all this behind and come live with me at the factory?
sure.

## i mean, it's all right if my family come too?
oh, my dear boy, of course they can't.

## so if i go with you to the factory, i won't ever see my family again?
yeah.

## sure you won't change your mind?
i make the candy i feel like, but now i feel terrible, so the candy's terrible.

## you ever met him?
i don't feel so hot.

## what makes you feel better when you feel terrible?
my family.

## what do you have against my family?
it's not just your family.

## my father?
no way.

## you want me to go with you?
hey.

## do you have an appointment?
no.

## now, let's see what the damage is, shall we?
heavens.

## willy?
hi, dad.

## you staying for dinner, willy?
yes, please.

## how do you feel about little raspberry kites?
with licorice instead of string.

## what's happening?
ahh... we have sort of a problem here.

## did you see the memo about this?
yeah.

## what's happening?
um...

## milton?
hi.

## uh... could you turn that down just a little bit?
but i was told that i could listen... to the radio at a reasonable volume from 9:00 to 11:00.

## what's happening?
we need to talk about your t. p. s. reports.

## did you get that memo?
i swear to god, one of these days....

## wow! ls that your real name?
yeah.

## so are you related to that singer guy?
no.

## why should i change?
he's the one who sucks.

## wanna go to chotchkie's, get some coffee?
just coffee.

## uh, yeah, well, i work at lnitech... and i don't consider myself a pussy, ok?
yes.

## if you're so obsessed with her, why don't you just ask her out?
oh, i can't do that.

## why not?
i'm gonna see this occupational hypnotherapist with anne.

## dude, an occupational hypnotherapist?
i know.

## what is that supposed to mean?
nothing.

## why don't you just tell anne that you're not into hypnosis... and you wanna play poker with us?
i can't do that.

## hey, and speaking of problems... what's this i hear about you having problems... with your t. p. s. reports?
yeah.

## what's he doing?
i knew it.

## what?
it's a staff meeting.

## so what?
we're all screwed.

## how do i know?
they're bringing in a consultant.

## you know there are people in this world... that don't have to put up with all this shit?
like that guy that invented the pet rock.

## you think the pet rock was a really great idea?
sure it was.

## what was it, tom?
well, all right.

## so what did you say?
i never had an answer.

## lawrence, can't you just pretend...
you know what i would do if i had a million dollars?

## oh, sorry, man!
no, but...

## doesn't that chick look like anne?
yeah.

## what do you mean by that?
i don't know, man.

## well... when a boss wants you to work on saturday... he generally asks you at the end of the day, right?
yeah.

## lawrence, what would you do if you had a million dollars?
i'll tell you what i'd do, man.

## if you had a million dollars... you'd do two chicks at the same time?
damn straight.

## besides two chicks at the same time?
well, yeah.

## ls this good for the company?
am i helping with...

## peter:ls that the guy?
yeah.

## uh, i'll talk to you later, all right?
bye.

## what's happening?
um...

## ok?
oh, oh, and i almost forgot.

## i'm also gonna need you to go ahead and come in... on sunday, too, ok?
we, um...

## is today the worst day of your life?
yeah.

## could i come home... and think that i've been fishing all day or something?
that's... really not what i do, peter.

## just checking in.
is he breathing?

## huh?
it's three thirty.

## i didn't feel like it.
why aren't you at work?

## peter, what's gotten into you?
i heard he didn't show up this weekend.

## so, uh... any questions?
hi.

## can i help you?
uh, well, our specials today are blackened chicken.

## are you are you serious?
yeah.

## i'm gonna go next door and get a table... and if you'd like to join me, uh... no big deal, all right?
and if not, that's cool, too.

## ok?
ok.

## what you do at lnitech... is you take the specifications from the customers... and you bring them down to the software engineers?
yes.

## well, then i just have to ask... why couldn't the customers... just take them directly to the software people, huh?
well, i'll tell you why.

## so... you physically take the specs from the customer?
well... no.

## what what would you say you do here?
well, look, i already told you.

## bolton?
yeah.

## ls that your real name?
yeah.

## are you any relation to the pop singer?
no, it's it's just a coincidence.

## but you must really love his music, huh?
yeah, he's he's... he's pretty he's pretty good, i guess.

## so tell me, what's your favorite song of his?
mmm...

## i wonder if i'm allowed to, uh, wear this in here?
i think it would be ok.

## would you like to sit down?
ok.

## that's one of my my pieces of flair.
is it?

## so, where do you, work, peter?
peter:lnitech.

## what what do you do there?
i sit in a cubicle... and i update bank software for the 2000 switch.

## what's that?
well, see, they wrote all this bank software... and, uh, to save space... they used two digits for the date instead of four.

## you're just not gonna go?
yeah.

## won't you get fired?
i don't know.

## so you're gonna quit?
nah uh.

## uh, when did you decide all that?
about an hour ago.

## oh, really?
yeah.

## so you're gonna get another job?
i don't think i'd like another job.

## can we order lunch first?
yeah.

## what's happening?
nothing.

## so if you could just get to that as soon as possible... that would be terrific, ok?
thanks a bunch, milton.

## what the hell's going on, man?
i thought you'd come in here and start shooting.

## what?
peter, you're in deep shit.

## what were you doing?
michael, i did nothing.

## the who?
the consultants.

## what has gotten into you?
oh, yeah... right.

## so if you would... would you walk us through a typical day for you?
yeah.

## peter, would you be a good sport... and indulge us and just... tell us a little more?
oh, yeah.

## it's a problem of motivation, all right?
now, if i work my ass off... and lnitech ships a few extra units...

## so where's the motivation?
and here's something else, bob...

## i beg your pardon?
eight bosses.

## eight?
eight, bob.

## would you bear with me for just a second, please?
ok.

## would that do anything for you?
i don't know.

## good luck with your layoffs, all right?
i hope your firings go really well.

## so, peter, what's happening?
listen, uh...

## joanna, would you come here a minute, please?
yeah.

## really?
l i have fifteen pieces on.

## well, fifteen is the minimum, ok?
oh.

## ok, so you want me to wear more?
look, joanna...

## people can get a cheeseburger anywhere, ok?
they come to chotchkie's for the atmosphere and the attitude.

## you do want to express yourself, don't you?
y yeah.

## who's he?
you know, squirrelly looking guy.

## so, uh, milton has been let go?
just a second there, professor.

## how much time would you say you spend each week... dealing with these t. p. s. reports?
no.

## so i guess we should probably go ahead... and have a little talk, hmm?
not right now, lumbergh, i'm i'm kinda busy.

## what's happening?
i i didn't receive my paycheck this week.

## ok?
uh, excuse me...

## you're gonna layoff samir and michael?
yeah.

## do they know this yet?
no.

## so you're going to fire michael and samir... and give me more money?
uh huh.

## what are you doing tonight?
uh, no offense there, peter... but speak for yourself there, sport.

## well, how does it work?
it's pretty brilliant.

## so, michael, what's to stop you from doing this?
it's not worth the risk.

## and you're gonna go in tomorrow... they're gonna throw you out on the street.
what if you didn't have a good job?

## you know why?
so bill lumbergh's stock will go up a quarter of a point.

## your software works, right?
of course it works.

## ok?
yeah.

## for another job where they can fire you for no reason?
that's right.

## aren't you?
yes, but i'm not going to do anything illegal.

## illegal?
samir, this is america.

## really?
yes.

## so what do you think?
this thing is actually pretty fail safe, samir.

## samir?
you came here looking for a land of opportunity.

## what's it gonna be?
i have a question.

## in this conjugal visits, you can have sex with women?
ok, yeah, good, right.

## we have to swear to god, allah... that nobody knows about this but us, all right?
no family members, no girlfriends.

## what the fuck is that?
don't worry.

## that he got laid off?
no, man, check it out.

## peter:ls he dead?
no, man, check it out.

## you ok, tom?
yeah, i think i'm ok.

## is he ok?
sort of.

## what did you steal?
i'm driving.

## ok?
it's fun, and it's exciting.

## all right?
joanna's coming over.

## all right?
monday morning, we're gonna check the account balance.

## what were you guys celebrating last night?
oh, um... l'm not really at liberty to talk about it.

## so you're stealing?
uh, no.

## so you're gonna make a lot of money, right?
yeah.

## it's not yours?
uh... well, it becomes ours.

## how is that not stealing?
i don't think i'm explaining this very well.

## um, the 7 eleven, right?
you'd take a penny from the tray.

## from the crippled children?
no, that's the jar.

## i'm just talking about fractions of a penny, ok?
but we do it from a much bigger tray... and we do it a couple of million times.

## so what's wrong with that?
i don't know.

## initech is an evil corporation, all right?
chotchkie's is wrong.

## doesn't it bother you that you have to get up in the morning... and you have to put on a bunch of pieces of flair?
yeah, but i'm not about to go in and start... taking money from the register.

## we don't have to talk about this now.
what?

## let's just go to the barbecue, all right?
i'm glad you could make it.

## well... what do you think?
it's a prototype.

## really?
sure.

## conjugal visits?
not that i know of.

## drew.
why do you ask, anyway?

## that's something about old smykowski, huh?
yeah.

## hey, isn't that the girl that works over at chotchkie's?
yep.

## who's she here with?
she's with me.

## really?
yep.

## are you kidding me?
she gets around.

## she does, does she?
oh, yeah, like a record.

## like with who?
oh, let's see, uh...

## what if you get caught?
oh, i just don't know if this was such a good idea.

## peter, what is wrong with you?
that was, like, two years ago.

## did you know him?
yeah, i know him.

## hey, that is none of your business, ok?
i didn't ask you who you slept with before we were together.

## you think you're an angel?
no, you're just this penny stealing... wannabe criminal man.

## i wanna get out of the car, ok?
stop.

## great.
so don't call me, ok?

## we need to talk.
peter, what's happening?

## my, uh, flair?
yeah.

## huh, what do i think?
um, you know what, stan... if you want me to wear thirty seven pieces of flair...

## iike your, uh, pretty boy over there, brian... why don't you just make the minimum... thirty seven pieces of flair?
well, i thought i remembered you saying... that you wanted to express yourself.

## you know what?
yeah, i do.

## all right?
there's my flair.

## ok?
and this is me expressing myself.

## ok?
there it is.

## you said this thing was gonna take two years.
what happened?

## it did not work, michael, ok?
ok.

## here, peg, you wanna get everybody started?

## guys, wh what's going on?
we don't know, sir.

## what do you mean, you don't know?
your security clearance is higher than ours.

## i have security clearance?
we're just here to bring you to your jet.

## i have a jet?
hey, serge.

## what am i doing here?
they wouldn't brief me until you got here.

## when are you going to meet a nice girl and bring her for dinner?
i'm married to my work.

## tom purcell.
you're... you're teasing me, right?

## gentlemen, you do realize that everything here is totally classified, okay?
at 10:30 a. m. local time, 32 civilians, all within a 10 block radius... died.

## nerve agent?
our first guess.

## they all died at the same time?
as far as we can tell, to the second.

## ls there a variation in sex, age, body type?
they all had pacemakers.

## without any clues from the victims?
no, that's...

## now i need to know, did some sort of weapon kill these people?
look at my hat.

## what is it, sweetheart?
no, no, no, the long range stuff.

## right?
acker.

## what are we doing?
i need a 3 d computer model of the earth to lay the field over.

## whoa ho ho, the planet earth?
yeah, the planet earth.

## listen, josh, do we even have time for this?
do this and i'll sign your doctorates blindfolded.

## blindfolded?
blindfolded.

## give me some drag, will you?
roger that.

## weren't able to annoy the commander into letting you bring her in this time?
that's a negative, stick.

## ls that even possible?
endeavour, we see you in good entry config.

## where the hell are we?
endeavour, guidance is bad.

## ls that...?
los angeles.

## the guidance, the beacons are all wrong?
we're heading straight for downtown.

## bob, you know l. a.?
because i have an idea.

## can you clear a freeway?
okay, thank you.

## houston?
computers are still plotting.

## all right, beck, what do you got?

## what's your name?
josh keyes.

## young man, do you have any idea who i am?

your crew crashed the space shuttle.

## now, how good do you think it could be?
sir, this is my life.

## really?
it's like the 4th of july.

## rebecca, would you excuse me, please?
excuse me.

## did zimsky really try to give you his autograph?
ah, monsieur zimsky.

## weren't you the one?
i spoke with the kids.

## ls there any chance you're wrong?
we'd be grateful if you could join us for a ride, sir.

## and if i were to say no?
just asking.

## but now...?
but now, that field is falling apart.

## why?
this here.

## does somebody have a can of air freshener?
quick and dirty.

## are you following me?
the inner core is, uh... well, it's a big, solid chunk of iron, we think.

## how could this have happened?
we don't know.

## what's the timeline here?
as the em field becomes more and more unstable, we'll start seeing isolated incidents.

## would you?
mm hmm.

## may l?
feel free to throw up.

## so, how do we fix it?
we can't.

## ... what if we could?
hello, braz.

## why the hell aren't you dead yet?
okay, this way.

## have you begun to think about a shell?
okay, this is alex.

## what do you call this material?
well, its real name has 37 syilables.

## unobtainium?
mm hmm.

## theoretically?
theoretically, yes.

## excuse me, dr. brazzleton, when do you think the ship will be operational?
when i get my fabrication methods perfected... 12... ten years, ten years.

## what would it take to get it done in three months?
$15 billion.

## why don't you use a credit card?
you get miles.

## you guys aren't here to whack me, are you?
because i was really, really hoping to have sex before that happened.

## excuse me, but is this really the best we could do?
i mean...

## how many languages do you speak?
five, actually.

## do you have any idea...?
okay, hey.

## what kind of help?
lnformation control.

## you want me to hack the planet?
he wants me to hack the planet.

## hot pockets?
they help me concentrate.

## you and you alone were responsible for proposing the descent vectors for the shuttle, correct?
yes, general.

## why?
i don't know.

## so, how are you holding up?
oh, hi.

## why did he touch his tie like that?
thomas, let me speak with you for a moment.

## listen, wouldn't you rather i did this?
i mean, given my reputation, i think that...

## terranauts?
hello.

## it's the simplest things that are the hardest, huh?
yeah.

## can i help you?
yes, please.

## you're an astronaut, and you can tie a windsor?
mm hmm.

## ls there anything you can't do?
not that i'm aware of.

## a thousand megatons, give or take?
tops.

## braz, do you think the ship can handle five of these babies?
yeah.

## lsn't that going to affect the way the explosions are...?
yes, yes, yes, yes.

## and what if the core is made of cheese?
this is all best guess, commander.

## ls ejection really the best option?
for the 22nd time in a row, everyone on earth is dead.

## what is this?
well, it's...

## apocalypse boy?
yeah.

## this is really cool, but can i just...?
well... mm hmm.

## crashing one ship isn't enough for you?
hey.

## what makes you think i'm not?
because you're so good.

## josh, do you mind?
no, not at all.

## virgil the poet that led our man into the depths of hell?
that's it.

## what's our depth?
1, 600 feet, plenty of room on both sides.

## you sure?
let's increase impeller speed.

## what's happening?
t phase.

## still think the water launch was a good idea?
yes, yes, i chose this location because the crust is thin here.

## you see that rock?
that is not good.

## can't.
what do you mean, pressure?

## what?
we're locked in.

## but what if we hit bottom in ten seconds here?
just give it a couple more seconds.

## assuming?
yes, assuming.

## virgil, can we get a status check?
we're about to make the transition into the mantle.

## i beg your pardon?
i said...

## an obligation to make a book deal perhaps?
two book deals, if you'd like to know the truth.

## when did you learn how to read?
people.

## drs. zimsky and keyes?
you guys are our resident geophysicists.

## what do you make of this?
the mantle is a chemical hodgepodge of... a variety of elements...

## so what's... what's static?
it's nothing.

## what do you mean?
it's nothing.

## serge, you all right?
yeah.

## anybody hurt?
no.

## you okay?
yeah.

## what is that?
from the cooling system.

## where in god's name are we?
whatever has us jammed up is inside our lasers.

## josh, is there any other image you can pull up?
nope.

## what?
believe me, i hate to admit it, but i think he's right.

## the cooling system that's keeping us from roasting to death in this ship?
well, just a small part of it.

## alternatives?
anybody.

## where the hell are we?
well, the good news is, it looks like the suits can take the pressure.

## beck, try the lights, will you?
lighting up.

## cobalt shell, maybe?
no. l i mean, in a magma environment of 5, 000 degrees.

## yeah?
we're inside a giant gem bubble, wrapped in a cobalt cocoon 700 miles below the surface of the earth.

## braz, what can i do?
check the feeds for me.

## okay, guys, connect the oxygen.
what?

## braz, you got that?
yes.

## bob?
you're going to be weak.

## i'm going to check your heartbeat, okay?
thanks, braz.

## so, that's the bad news?
that's not too bad.

## let's give him a second, okay?
he deserves that.

## oh, god, this all just seems too big, doesn't it?
i think you were attempting the impossible.

## hey... who's steering the ship?
video screen autopilot.

## you're not from the cla, or the nsa or any of those three letter places?
no.

## where are you?
key's in, dr. brazzleton.

## ready?
yeah.

## yes?
we're not supposed to go through anything black.

## what is this?
they're scattered everywhere.

## diamonds?
i want some.

## we're not going to forget about you, man.
can i help?

## josh, i can't see you.
josh, can you hear me?

## braz is going to override the doors manually, okay?
we're working on it right now.

## braz, how long?
going as fast as i can, fast as i can.

## beck, override the ejection systems, okay?
we're not going to forget about you, man.

## we're working on it, all right?
stay with me here.

## okay?
i don't know what to do.

## can you hear me now?
all right, here i am.

## i'm going to come to paris and we'll go out, all right?
after this.

## did you reset the overrides?
i never pushed them.

## actually, you really want to know?
i killed him twice.

## do you want me to feel any worse about that than i already do?
it's not possible.

## could you have made the decision?
yes.

## could you?
yes, i could've.

## josh, can you hear me?
ready as we'll ever be, stick.

## would you please punch the new core density into the equations for the nuclear detonation?
please tell me this is enough.

## you're telling me the 1, 000 megatons of nuclear warheads we hauled down here isn't going to cut it?
no.

## what?
the energy waves from the explosion won't spread far enough.

## what?
our commander is dead.

## what are you talking about?
general, this is dr. conrad zimsky.

## now what the hell is destiny?
it's a device.

## so?
so... we built one, too.

## zimsky, what makes you think that destiny would even touch the core?
this isn't a fluke.

## why weren't we notified of this, sir?
because you didn't need to know, major.

## so the device that killed the planet is your backup plan?
an electric shock can stop a heart.

## what?
i'm afraid it's all we've got.

## what?
well, plan c.

## rebecca?
it's the em monitoring station.

## remember those invisible microwaves that josh was talking about?
well, they just found a hole.

## what are you laughing at?
no, i mean, it took me and 400 of the world's smartest people to come up with the first plan.

## you want to help?
no.

## braz, no, look, i have a theory.
what's v?

## are you interested?
yes.

## hmm?
all right, fine, look.

## look, we have to use wave interference, okay?
because one explosion won't do it.

## what?
virgil's not designed to eject undamaged compartments.

## where's the master gear?
ln the crawl space we used to get out earlier.

## well, what the hell is it doing there?
i built the ship in three damn months.

## can you flush it with liquid nitrogen?
we don't have enough at this point.

## and our suits are built to withstand...?
half that, probably.

## just a moment, may i see that?
no.

## may l?
yes.

## why do you get dibs on being the hero?
because it's my damn ship.

## yes, conrad?
you're right.

## damn me?
too late.

## what's that?
gotcha!... four, three, two...

## oh, hey, general.
well, how long will it take to get it back online?

## ls there something i can do for you?
the last bomb is not enough.

## where are we going to get six or seven pounds of plutonium?
i think the flare has knocked the coms out.

## can you hear me?
i'm correcting course.

## beck.
can you hear me?

## beck, can you hear me?
beck, if you have any better ideas, you tell me now.

## what could you do if i got you enough power to fire the impeller?
maybe not the laser but the impeller.

## from where?
the heat of the core.

## come on, beck, where is it?
come on.

## ls that the last one?
yeah.

## let's just pray we don't run into any dead ends, or we're going to miss those lasers.
so, rat, what's the center of this quake?

## okay, navigator, which way?
we've got greater fluid density on the left.

## bill, where are they headed?
looks like she found a space between some tectonic plates somewhere near hawaii.

## yeah?
they're closing in on us too fast.

## where'd our power go?
well, we're powered by the heat.

## you always look on the bright side?
always.

## where do they think?
bill, put it up on the hydrophone.

## orbital wobble?
yeah, that's what they call it.

## do you ever get tired of being right?
yes.

## so what's next for you?
a shower.

## you?
deep dish pepperoni pizza, green peppers, onions, extra mushrooms then a shower and then back to the classroom.

## you know what makes me really, really angry?
destiny, meet world.

## okay, guys, connect the oxygen.
what?

## braz, you got that?
yes.

## bob?
you're going to be weak.

## i'm going to check your heartbeat, okay?
thanks, braz.

## so, that's the bad news?
that's not too bad.

## let's give him a second, okay?
he deserves that.

## oh, god, this all just seems too big, doesn't it?
i think you were attempting the impossible.

## hey... who's steering the ship?
video screen autopilot.

## you're not from the cla, or the nsa or any of those three letter places?
no.

## where are you?
key's in, dr. brazzleton.

## ready?
yeah.

## yes?
we're not supposed to go through anything black.

## what is this?
they're scattered everywhere.

## diamonds?
i want some.

## we're not going to forget about you, man.
can i help?

## josh, i can't see you.
josh, can you hear me?

## braz is going to override the doors manually, okay?
we're working on it right now.

## braz, how long?
going as fast as i can, fast as i can.

## beck, override the ejection systems, okay?
we're not going to forget about you, man.

## we're working on it, all right?
stay with me here.

## okay?
i don't know what to do.

## can you hear me now?
all right, here i am.

## i'm going to come to paris and we'll go out, all right?
after this.

## did you reset the overrides?
i never pushed them.

## actually, you really want to know?
i killed him twice.

## do you want me to feel any worse about that than i already do?
it's not possible.

## could you have made the decision?
yes.

## could you?
yes, i could've.

## josh, can you hear me?
ready as we'll ever be, stick.

## would you please punch the new core density into the equations for the nuclear detonation?
please tell me this is enough.

## you're telling me the 1, 000 megatons of nuclear warheads we hauled down here isn't going to cut it?
no.

## what?
the energy waves from the explosion won't spread far enough.

## what?
our commander is dead.

## what are you talking about?
general, this is dr. conrad zimsky.

## now what the hell is destiny?
it's a device.

## so?
so... we built one, too.

## zimsky, what makes you think that destiny would even touch the core?
this isn't a fluke.

## why weren't we notified of this, sir?
because you didn't need to know, major.

## so the device that killed the planet is your backup plan?
an electric shock can stop a heart.

## what?
i'm afraid it's all we've got.

## what?
well, plan c.

## rebecca?
it's the em monitoring station.

## remember those invisible microwaves that josh was talking about?
well, they just found a hole.

## what are you laughing at?
no, i mean, it took me and 400 of the world's smartest people to come up with the first plan.

## you want to help?
no.

## braz, no, look, i have a theory.
what's v?

## are you interested?
yes.

## hmm?
all right, fine, look.

## look, we have to use wave interference, okay?
because one explosion won't do it.

## what?
virgil's not designed to eject undamaged compartments.

## where's the master gear?
ln the crawl space we used to get out earlier.

## well, what the hell is it doing there?
i built the ship in three damn months.

## can you flush it with liquid nitrogen?
we don't have enough at this point.

## and our suits are built to withstand...?
half that, probably.

## just a moment, may i see that?
no.

## may l?
yes.

## why do you get dibs on being the hero?
because it's my damn ship.

## yes, conrad?
you're right.

## damn me?
too late.

## what's that?
gotcha!... four, three, two...

## oh, hey, general.
well, how long will it take to get it back online?

## ls there something i can do for you?
the last bomb is not enough.

## where are we going to get six or seven pounds of plutonium?
i think the flare has knocked the coms out.

## can you hear me?
i'm correcting course.

## beck.
can you hear me?

## beck, can you hear me?
beck, if you have any better ideas, you tell me now.

## will you take my gloves off?
oh, my god.

## where's zimsky?
come here.

## what could you do if i got you enough power to fire the impeller?
maybe not the laser but the impeller.

## from where?
the heat of the core.

## come on, beck, where is it?

## juno, are you sure this is the right way?
relax, i've never been lost in my life.

## so have you done these caves before?
no.

## juno, are we there yet?

## nature detectives?
it could have been big foot.

## you ok?

## look, i have done this before, you know?
i'm only looking after you.

## ok?

## which way?
there's only one way out of this chamber and that's down the pipe.

## ok?
holly, chuck us your bag.

## holly, would you take a break?
i just want to take a few more shots.

## hey?
not hungry.

## are you ok?
juno, i won't break.

## um, sarah?
l haven't had a chance to say that i'm... really sorry i didn't stay around longer after the accident.

## anyway..... we're all here for you now, ok?
yeah.

## so i'm just going to take a look around, ok?
yeah, ok.

## why don't you try and find us the way through, huh?
hey, don't go too far.

## what's up with her?
she looks like she's seen a ghost.

## what?
this is not how i imagined it from reading the book.

## something wrong?
no.

## sarah?
shit.

## are you still behind me?
guys, it's sarah, i think she might be stuck.

## just listen to my voice, yeah?
sarah, i'm coming.

## ok?

## sarah, ok?
listen to me, keep breathing.

## ok?
hey.

## look here at me, sarah, hey?
help me.

## what are you so worried about, sarah?
look at me.

## breathe, ok?
hey, hey, hey.

## this is just a poxy cave and there's nothing left to be afraid of, i promise.
what are you so afraid of?

## ok?
hey.

## how do you give a lemon an orgasm?
god damn it, let me hear you say it.

## what do you do?
you tickle its citrus.

## take hold of my arm, all right?
we're going to move slowly.

## that's it, grab my arm, ok?
ok, come on.

## pull on me, ok?
oh, ah.

## are you ok?
i'm all right.

## juno:ls everybody ok? ls everybody ok?
don't fucking touch me.

## rebecca?
i'm here, i'm ok.

## beth, are you injured?
no, i'm fine.

## so what's the story now?
according to the guidebook, this cave system has three ways out.

## juno, that's right, isn't it?
check the book.

## what?
no point.

## you filed a flight plan to mountain rescue?
lf we don't report in, they'll come looking for us.

## we're in the wrong fucking cave?
holly was right.

## we said, if there's no risk, what's the point?
don't try and justify this.

## where are we?
there may not be a way out.

## what the fuck do you think you're doing?
we all trusted you.

## have you any idea what she's been through?
no, cos you couldn't get away fast enough, you selfish cow.

## you know what, beth?
don't move, sam.

## so, what now?
one of us has to get all the way across there so they can rig a line for you guys.

## where is it?
we lost it, when the cave collapsed.

## what are you waiting for?
fuck.

## what's wrong?
it's nothing.

## was this about me or you?
it's about us, getting back to what we used to be.

## juno?
we'll need everything we've got.

## what does it mean?
it means we're not the first.

## it's a piton, right?
lf cavers were here, there's a better chance of us getting out.

## becca, are you ok?
i'll live.

## holly, how does it look?
lt's tight again, but i can get through.

## what is it, beth?
juno, light up one of your flares.

## what do you see?
you've got the mountain, the cave... and there's two entrances.

## this means there's another way out?
holly, give me your lighter.

## what are you gonna do?
i need to dress the wound and rig up a splint, but i can't while the bone is protruding.

## it'll be all right.
just fucking bite down, ok?

## what are you doing?
i just saw something ahead in the tunnel.

## that is just what it looked like.
sarah?

## what?
sarah thinks she saw someone.

## saw what?
i don't think i saw someone, i saw someone.

## what did you see?
a man.

## hey, we have to get holly out of here.
are you sure?

## ok?
this is all that matters right now.

## you've got to keep warm.
ls it?

## why are we walking away?
there was daylight back there.

## holly, where's the infrared button?
dead animals.

## which way?
come on.

## what do you mean, you don't know?
there's no breeze.

## my battery's gone dead.
where is it?

## what's happened to the others?
becca, please say we're gonna get out of here.

## we heard you crying for sarah.
sam?

## where are the others?
they...

## sam..... what is that thing?
i don't know.

## you think?
the climbing gear we found whoever brought that down here marked their route.

## well, what are we waiting for?
sarah.

## what?
she did this to me.

## what?
she left me.

## i'm not leaving you here, ok?
didn't make it.

## you saw her die?
come on.

## zero one zero, can you confirm deployment?
roger that, eagle.

## why are you lying?

## he grabbed me, right?

## you wanna try it again, motherfucker?
let's go, baby.

it seems unlikely, sir.

## how could someone get drugs in?

in the article...

## who are you talking to?

## are you ready?
guests will be here soon.

## the iron what?
boar.

## i seem to recall this general hood.
isn't that so, marshall?

## he was involved in some disastrous battle and lost a leg, didn't he?
i wouldn't say it was disastrous.

## he lost an arm as well, didn't he?
no, he didn't lose an arm.

## drink, general?
thank you.

## you know what?
i don't go much for this lineage shit.

## get me another one of these, will you?
right away, sir.

## how's it going?
oh, the usual.

## what's he doing here?
i don't know.

## you crazy or something?
i'm just trying to get back to my room.

## no trouble?
ok.

## you elwood's homey?
yeah, he's my roommate.

## oh, you're roommates?
that's real nice, man.

## ain't you sick of being fucked by a white man?
uh oh, customers.

## hey, you wanna know something?
you ain't like elwood here.

## he murdered your car?
yeah, shot to pieces.

## why would he do that?
that's pretty extreme, even for him.

## are you into some kind of shit on the side?
i've lived on base my whole life.

## oh, really?
yeah.

## aren't you?
a fiasco.

## a debacle even, wouldn't you say?
goddamn it, it was your idea.

## what?
leave it to me.

## when you say fuck me up, what do you mean?
i mean, fuck you right up.

## are you saying he's gonna kill me?
i don't know, but...

## why are you telling me all this?
i guess i don't want him to fuck you up.

## general?
there's something i'd like to talk to you about.

## er, what do you have in mind?
well, with all this activity in the east, i thought we should stay on our toes.

## do you really think you're up for this sort of thing?
oh, yes, sir.

## you want to defend the nuke base against marshall's infantry?
yes, sir.

## wallace, can i see you in the kitchen?
just a moment, honey.

## er, marshall, what do you think?
er... sounds good to me.

## what's that?
you're bored.

## do you ever have falling dreams?
sure.

## is that the same as yours?
kind of.

## well, why, what happens in yours?
i wake up before i hit the ground.

## about what?
some strange shit's been going down.

## what's he been saying?
nothing.

## but you've killed people before in war and stuff, right?
and now you wanna kill ray elwood.

## it's no different, is it?
i really don't think you know what you're talking about.

## who the fuck did that to you?
fuckers.

## just let me clean it up, all right?
i've got some stuff here.

## what is that?
it'll calm you down.

## i'll get you a beer, yeah?
ok.

## it fucks with your head, and... sometimes you don't know who to trust, you know?
yeah.

## don't you think?
a stunning success.

## hm?
well, honey, it's been a while.

## why, in your opinion, was it a good idea to challenge marshall to a training exercise when you're supply and he's infantry?
you told me i should go on the attack.

## right?
the deal's off, sir.

## what do you mean, it's off?
there's just some bad shit happening right now and i can't do it.

## a bit of fun?
i don't know.

## they killed your friend, huh?
some fucking russians killed my son.

## you talk to me about your friend?
i don't give a fuck about your friend.

## how did it go?
great.

## how the fuck are we supposed to get the guns out of the nuke base with this training exercise?
if berman's exercise lasts all weekend, there's no way we're gonna get the guns out.

## how the fuck are you gonna take care of it?
i said i'll fucking take care of it.

## what you looking at, son?
you better get on out of here.

## you're a real bad motherfucker, ain't you?
take him to the shed.

## what do you want?
a little investment advice.

## how much you think you'll make on that shipment?
it'll tide me over.

## well, do you know what security on that'll be?
well, i guess you're here to give me a price quote.

## you wanna talk business, right?
so let's talk business.

## what the fuck are you talking about, a cut?
i'm your brand new fucking partner.

## they hurt you again?
no, i just kind of got a sore elbow.

## what is it?
the thing about cooking smack is, to not get fucked up by the fumes, you gotta have a full stomach.

## catch my drift here, right?
saad doesn't eat meat.

## line up.
why the hell did they go over there?

## did i ever tell you i met president kennedy?
no.

## do you know what general lancaster called me?
incompetent.

## will he include that in your efficiency report, sir?
oh, yeah.

## you know what i'm gonna do, elwood?
i'm gonna take my pension and buy that vineyard.

## that doesn't sound like such a bad idea, does it?
make sure and give the turk all my love.

## hey, you feel bad about berman?
oh, fuck, no.

## you don't feel bad about tipping off marshall?
i thought you liked berman.

## couldn't find the base?
you boys are looking tense.

## so, how long does it take to cook this stuff?
most of the night.

## what the fuck is he doing here?
he's with me.

## got a problem with that?
whoa, whoa, saad, do me a favour and put that out.

## what happens if it goes below?
if it goes below 80, the reaction stops, we gotta cook longer.

## well, what?
cooking smack is like preparing thanksgiving dinner where one ingredient is a hand grenade.

## this shit explodes?
kaboom.

## you on it?
i'm on it, man.

## saad, do you want a hotdog?
i don't want no fucking hotdog.

## you got no vegetarian shit?
hotdogs are made up of lips, udders and assholes.

## can we just eat our hotdogs and chill out?
not you, of course, saad.

## what are you worried about?
just kick back, watch some tv, educate yourself.

## robyn?
come on up.

## are you scared?
of course i'm not scared.

## what would it take to make you jump?
a parachute.

## why are you putting your arms up like that?
hi.

## why do you motherfuckers eat so damn much?
because we're growing lads.

## shit, what time is it?
it's midnight.

## where you going?
fuck.

## can i come?
they're in there.

## where is the berlin wall?
it's in berlin, you dumb fuck.

we're in east.

## what's the difference?
fucked if i know, man.

## what are you doing with robyn?
captain kimborough, come in.

## so, you've been putting it to my daughter and you think that's making war?
war, you dumb fuck, is playing for keeps.

## well, who do you think took out stoney?
you are fucking stupid.

## can you wait one second?
listen to me.

## what's he doing?
he's taking him to the stockade.

## you wanna hear the secret of vietnam?
the secret of vietnam's simple.

## what are you doing here, sir?
get away from the window.

## you got the balls to do something like that?
boiling point.

## no, what is it?
defence superior service medal, sir.

## they think it was a gas explosion?
yes, sir.

## and this er, robert lee, the sergeant that got the posthumous silver star, you knew him well, did you?
yes, sir.

## is that right?
i didn't know that.

## how's she doing?
she's doing ok, sir.

## are you sure you're ok standing?
if the leg starts getting weary, you just cop a squat.

## so, you like it here in hawaii?
yeah.

## now, see what have we got here?
oh, just some requisitions, sir.

## do we really need that much?
well, cleanliness is next to godliness.

## can i look out?
no, they might shoot us.

## then the war is over?
soon.

## but what is that noise?
panic.

## air power, field marshal?
briefly, please.

## ammunition?
also minimal.

## replacements?
minimal.

## morale?
nonexistent.

## what do you think we should do?
end the war, you fools.

## why in the world are you laughing?
excuse us.

## anything at all on when they plan to invade holland?
they seem to have paused in belgium.

## how many vehicles in the past hour?
fifty four.

## and for the same hour yesterday?
ninety eight.

## but when?
i've just got back to england from brussels... where i had a meeting this morning with field marshal montgomery.

## where's this all going to take place?
holland.

## and when?
i'm coming to that now.

## for how long?
monty assures me that 30 corps... will do the 63 miles in two days.

## why not?
the sooner we go, the better.

## is something troubling you, general sosabowski?
i've said nothing.

## but you do disapprove?
patton.

## arnhem?
arnhem.

## why the emergency meeting?
keeping abreast of the little changes.

## how big are the little changes?
i'll answer you with typical british understatement:gigantic.

## how about us?
we'll be all right.

## has it ever been tried before?
not in a major drop.

## think there might be a reason for that?
let's hope not.

## what do you think?
it'll be all right.

## is there anything else?
well, you're my dutch advisor, harry.

## i forgot to tell you something?
only that the germans first tried to take nijmegen bridge themselves... back in 1940, and got slaughtered.

## are you sure about the colors?
i'm sure, father.

## why?
the british will have an explanation.

## did you pass on the message about the tanks?
of course.

## yes, fuller?
we've got some information on tanks.

## what?
dutch underground reports from the arnhem area.

## have they been identified?
not by our intelligence, sir.

## so it's the same rumors as before, right?
i believe these rumors, sir.

## why?
the general consensus of opinion is that our opposition... will consist entirely of hitler youth or old men on bicycles.

## what's the terrain like?
sorry, sir.

## what about there?
afraid not, sir.

## presumably you're intending to let us land somewhere?
oh, yes.

## where the hell is it?
well, it's not actually on this photograph.

## yes, sir?
just making sure whose side you're on.

## and they'll be quick enough to secure both ends of arnhem bridge?
now look here.

## do you understand?
you ought to have more faith in montgomery's intelligence reports.

## do you wish such a letter?
of course not.

## you don't believe me, sir?
clearly not.

## but what then?
i just don't believe these damn radios are strong enough... to carry the eight miles from the drop zone to arnhem bridge.

## don't happen to have any cigarettes, do you, sir?
they're perfectly okay.

## any biscuits?
your biscuits are in your tin, sir.

## shouldn't you tell the general if you're so certain about it, sir?
if i were, believe me, i would.

## what difference will it make?
the general will be on the bridge himself by nightfall.

## he won't have to make contact with the bridge if he's on it, will he, sir?
well, if anyone rocks the boat... it's not gonna be me.

## but, sir... if they weren't serviceable, why would they try to conceal them?
normal routine, fuller.

## how many of them have shown tanks?
just these, sir.

## and you seriously consider asking us to cancel... the biggest operation mounted since d day... because of three photographs?
no, sir.

## is that fully understood?
yes, sir.

## what do you say to that, joe?
delighted, sir.

## do you want me to pack that as well, sir?
no, thank you, wicks.

## you haven't forgotten my golf clubs, have you?
well, let's hope so.

## why don't you quit that?
chock full of vitamins.

## hey, where'd you put that?
damn it, eddie, give it back.

## and what can guarantee that?
you will.

## i will what?
you tell me, eddie.

## hey, eddie, were you kidding?
major fuller.

## mind a bit of company?
of course not, sir.

## who isn't?
we've been getting reports from a number of your friends.

## is it because i rocked the boat?
i'm a doctor.

## but why?
i'm not ill or anything.

## can't it be stopped?
i don't want to be left behind, please.

## how do you feel?
fine.

## i told you i had never jumped, but thought i ought to give it a go?
well, you did me a big favor.

## what was the favor?
well, i didn't quite tell you everything at the time... but i'm prone to airsickness.

## soon be home, harry.
what, every flight?

## what was that?
easier than walking, sir.

## your sleeping beauties know there's a war on, do they?
absolutely, sir.

## is it true that the germans have put more troops into the line ahead of us?
yes.

## right you are, joe.
including me?

## any last minute changes, bob?
yes, sir.

## think you'll be able to manage it?
i've got nothing else planned for this afternoon.

## what the hell's that?
it's flak.

## fantastic, isn't it?
just once to have such power in my hands.

## british paratroopers have landed... three kilometers from here.
where the hell do you think you're going?

## why should they do that?
yeah.

## a strong force has landed south of nijmegen.
you okay?

## nijmegen?
they're after the bridge.

## yes, you'd like that, wouldn't you?
now listen.

## is that clear?
you must hold that bridge under any circumstances.

## understood?
clear.

## how far away is headquarters?
half a mile.

## any news of freddie gough's jeep squadron?
it's unconfirmed it's rather bad luck, sir.

## how the hell do they expect us to keep to schedule on a road like this?
you don't know the worst.

## this bit we're on now yes?
it's the wide part.

## think she'll get over thisaway?
might.

## you see them?
can't see them.

## you ever seen one this bad?
not since noah and the flood.

## what did you say?
well, even that wasn't this damn wet.

## that hurt?
yeah.

## mose, still got them cards?
yeah, i got them.

## you gonna play them cards, mose, or stare a hole through them?
yeah.

## when you want me to go?
tonight.

## how long you figure, charley?
without cows slowing things, maybe one day there, one back.

## ain't that so, charley?
i apologized to him for that.

## don't suppose he got into a poker game, do you?
wouldn't gamble your money, boss.

## what if he's lying out there waiting for us to come along?
we'd never find him tonight.

## you worried?
yeah, i'm worried.

## then why ain't he here with us?
well, you never was wanting to go to towns.

## always noticed you favor something light, don't you?
set it right down.

## not planning on staying long?
long as it takes to find who we're looking for.

## know where we can find him?
yeah.

## that cover what he owes?
oh, yeah.

## how long you had him here?
i brought him in here yesterday afternoon.

## why is that?
goddamn bear.

## you got a charge against him?

## how does $50 each offense sound?
like robbery.

## shot in the back, was he?
your man's horse and rig are at the livery barn.

## you got a doctor in this town?
yeah.

## this is the man who was in the fight with dent baxter's men?

## how much i owe you, doctor?

## how long we been riding together, charley?

## what's on your mind, boss?
way i figure it, we can leave the cattle and run, or you and me can go in the dark and stop them before they scatter the herd.

## you reckon them cows are worth getting killed over?
the cows is one thing.

## okay?
i got some sugar in that town.

## hey, charley?

## the doctor in?
no, he's not here.

## are you the boy's father?

## what about the fever?
he needs to lay still and let his body do its work.

## now, where's he at?

## ls that his real name?
please, sit.

## hmm?

## what about button?
yeah, considering i've just been swimming.

## remind you of anyone, charley?

## ls that so?
we got no quarrel with none of you folks.

## hell, charley, why don't we just ride out to baxter's ranch and go straight at him, too?
well, i'll fight wherever you want, boss.

## charley, come on in out of the rain, would you?

i better put him over here to dry, though.

## hey, where did this come from?
i found it.

## where?
ln the closet.

yes.

## do you know how?
i'll show you.

## captain howdy said no.
you really don't want me to play?

## captain who?
captain howdy.

## who's captain howdy?
you know.

## captain howdy, do you think my mom is pretty?
captain howdy, that isn't very nice.

## why are you reading that stuff?
i didn't have my makeup man there.

## lsn't it nice it's on sunday this year?
no work.

## what can we do?
i don't know.

## got any ideas?
let me think....

## shall we do that?
go sightseeing...

## ... if it's a nice day?
yeah, let's do that.

## mr. dennings?
well, you know, it's okay.

## thank you very much...... but why would i want to bring burke on your birthday?
well, you like him.

## me marry burke dennings?
don't be silly.

## where'd you ever get that idea?
but you like him.

## you don't like him like daddy?
regan, i love your daddy.

## what did you hear?
i don't know.

## how do you know?
because burke and i are just friends.

## okay?
really.

## are you ready for sleep?
good night, honey.

## am i really?
it's more than psychiatry, and you know that.

## hello?
yes.

## what are you doing here?
no rats.

## the edema affected her brain, you understand?
she don't let no doctor go near her.

## do you have an appointment?
yes.

## are you a relative?
i am her brother.

## why?
mama, i'm going to take you out of here.

## you?
there seems to be an alien pubic hair in my drink.

## i beg your pardon?
never seen it before in my life.

## have you?
we're pretty comfortable up there...... compared to the gemini and mercury programs, which were tight for space.

## yes, of course.
lf you ever go up there again, will you take me along?

## over behind the church.
and you never went bowling with goebbels either, i suppose, huh?

## you know where i mean?
it's a red brick wing.

## who's the priest i keep seeing there?
he's always there.

## who's that?
burke, your car's at the curb.

## what?
fuck it.

## honey, what's the matter?
i'm sorry, she's been sick.

## what's wrong with me?
it's just like the doctor said.

## ls it coming out, willie?
that's an insult.

## where'd you get it, then?
i stole it.

## now you think you can sleep?
yeah.

## are you going to steal my shoes now?
no.

## a convulsion?
the shaking of the bed.

## what causes this?
a lesion in the temporal lobe.

## it is?
it can last for days, even weeks.

## do me a favor, will you?
tell me something good.

## regan, can you sit up and scoot over here?
watch the l. v.

## i'm just going to move you down on the table, okay?
just for a short time.

## do you want me to run another series?
i don't think so.

## have you got some time?
of course.

## dr. klein?
yes, i'm dr. klein.

## ls she having spasms again?
yes, but they're violent.

## you gave her the medication?
yes.

## what was that?
thorazine.

## how could she fly off the bed like that?
pathological states can induce abnormal strength...... accelerated motor performance.

## now, i know the temptation is to leap to psychiatry...... but any reasonable psychiatrist would exhaust the somatic possibilities first.
so what's wrong with her?

## so, what's next?
a pneumoencephalogram, i would think, to pin down that lesion.

## do you keep any drugs in your house?
no, of course not.

## are you sure?
of course, i'm sure.

## are you planning to be home soon?
i mean to la.

## why do you ask?
i think it's time we started looking for a psychiatrist.

## what's burke got to do with it?
we have to start looking for a shrink.

## heard what?
you haven't heard.

## are you comfortable, regan?
yes.

## how old are you?
twelve.

## ls there someone inside you?
sometimes.

## who is it?
i don't know.

## ls it captain howdy?
i don't know.

## lf i ask him to tell me, will you let him answer?
no.

## why not?
i'm afraid.

## do you want him to leave you?
yes.

## have we met?
no, we haven't met, but they said i could tell.

## what's this all about?
it's true.

## do people say you look like paul newman?
always.

## you know this director who was doing a film here, burke dennings?
i've seen him.

## you're also familiar how last week he died?
only what i read in the papers.

## father, what do you know on the subject of witchcraft?
from the witching end, not the hunting.

## really?
from the psychiatric end.

## all of this desecration in the church...... does this have anything to do with witchcraft?
maybe.

## you read how he died?
ln a fall.

## that didn't happen in the fall?
it's possible.

## you think the killer and the desecrator are the same?
maybe somebody crazy, somebody with...... a spite against the church.

## a sick priest, is that it?
look, father, this is hard for you.

## doctor's ethics. lf you knew, you wouldn't tell, huh?
no, i probably wouldn't.

## ls that a threat?
very much.

## who's in it?
groucho marx.

## are you happy?
i've seen it.

## all right.
can you think of some priest who fits the bill?

## who?
the dominicans.

## i could have you deported, you know that?
i lied.

## you're sorry?
jesus christ, 88 doctors...... and all you can tell me, with all your bullshit is....

## do you have any religious beliefs?
no.

## what about your daughter?
no.

## have you ever heard of exorcism?
well, it's a stylized ritual in which the...... rabbi or the priest try to drive out the so called invading spirit.

## she's going to be well?
karl, if you put this in regan's bedroom, i want you to tell me.

## now, did you?
no, not me.

## did you put it there?
of course, i didn't.

## what?
a man to see you.

## might she remember?
no, she was heavily sedated.

## it's serious?
yes, i'm afraid it is.

## anything else?
no, karl, we're fine.

## why are you asking all this?
it's strange.

## but nobody was in the room except your daughter, so how can this be?
it could be one way.

## they have visitors?
not at all.

## you were expecting a package that day, some delivery?
none that i know of.

## groceries, cleaning... a package?
i really wouldn't know.

## would you like to ask him?
no, never mind, it's...... it's very remote.

## would you like some more coffee?
please.

## your daughter, she's the artist?
thank you.

## correct?
when she's better, i'll ask her.

## i really hate to ask you this, but...... for my daughter, could you please give an autograph?
of course.

## where's a pencil?
i lied.

## really?
please go away.

## have you got a cigarette, father?
sure.

## how did a shrink ever get to be a priest?
it's the other way around.

## where?
harvard, bellevue...... johns hopkins.

## you're a friend of father dyer's, right?
yes, i am.

## pretty close?
pretty close.

## did he talk to you about my party?
he sure did.

## about my daughter?
no, i didn't know you had one.

## he didn't mention her?
no.

## he didn't tell you what she did?
he didn't mention her.

## priests are pretty tight mouthed, then, huh?
that depends.

## on what?
the priest.

## would you have to turn them in?
well, if he came to me for spiritual advice, i'd say no.

## you wouldn't?
no, i wouldn't.

## lf a person is, you know, possessed by a demon, or something...... how do they get an exorcism?
first, i'd have to get them into a time machine...... and get them back to the 16th century.

## since when?
since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia...... those things they taught me at harvard.

## why?
i don't understand.

## how?
the church, before it approves an exorcism...... conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted.

## could you see her?
yes.

## lf you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
that's much too vulgar a display ofpower, karras.

## where's regan?
in here, with us.

## could you help an old altar boy, father?
your mother is in here with us, karras.

## would you like to leave a message?
i'll see that she gets it.

## what is it?
thank you.

## like what?
her speaking in a language she's never known or studied.

## what else?
no.

## did you know my mother died recently?
yes, i did.

## ls regan aware of it?
not at all.

## why do you ask?
it's not important.

## you'd like that?
intensely.

## but wouldn't that drive you out of regan?
it would bring us together.

## you and regan?
you and us.

## did you do that?
do it again.

## you speak latin?
ego te absolvo.

## quod nomen mihi est?
la plume de ma tante.

## how long are you planning to stay in regan?
until she rots and lies stinking in the earth.

## what's that?
you know, i'm like in seclusion.

## i'll call as soon as it's over, all right?
no, i just, i'm going through something and i just have to....

## want a drink?
please.

## what do you drink?
scotch.

## you sure?
yeah, sit.

## where's her father?
ln europe.

## have you told him what's happening?
no.

## what's the difference?
holy water is blessed.

## what?
she killed burke dennings.

## it's english.
who are you?

## what do you mean, english?
i'll be right there.

## you're convinced that it's genuine?
i don't know.

## you would want to do the exorcism yourself?
yes.

## how about lankester merrin?
i had a notion he was in lraq.

## what's he doing there, teaching?
he's working on another book.

## how's his health?
he must be all right.

## you're mrs. macneil?
yes.

## ls father karras here?

## why?
especially important is the warning to avoid conversations with the demon.

## are you tired?
let's rest before we start again.

## dimmy, why do you do this to me?
her heart.

## can you give her something?
she'll go into a coma.

## our father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
why, dimmy?

## ls she going to die?
no.

## are you sorry for...... are you sorry for having offended god and for all the sins of your past life?
ego te absolvo in nomine patris...

## what is it?
a phonograph.

## sure you won't change your mind?
i found this in her room.

## father dyer?
i thought you'd like to keep this.

## if you knew, you wouldn't tell?
no, i probably wouldn't.

## is that a threat?
very much.

## you want to see a film with me?
i've got passes to the crest.

## who's in it?
groucho marx.

## are you happy?
i've seen it.

## all right.
can you think of some priest who fits the bill?

## who?
the dominicans.

## i could have you deported, you know that?

you're a very nice lady.

## it's serious?
yes, i'm afraid it is.

## may i ask...?
we still don't know.

## anything else?

## why?
i don't understand.

## how?
secondly, the church, before it approves an exorcism...... conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted.

## could you see her?
yes, i could.

## see?
it's steady.

## oh, is he ok?
he's perfect.

## are we ok?
he's fine, honey.

## what's his name?
danny.

## see?
oh, my god.

## what's that music you're using?
i really dig it.

## so, danny, you still drawing?
nope.

## didn't you want to grow up to be an artist?
that's some of the opening sequence.

## do you think we'll be able to afford one?
yep.

## so, what happened?
she committed suicide.

## what happened to eddie?
eddie freaked out on me.

## hey, alan, have you seen these?
they are all over town.

## anyway, how's the monroe project coming?
fine.

## just fine?
just fine.

## who's your assistant?
i don't have an assistant.

## you have something for me, thelma?
straight to business.

## you know charles bannister?
his widow is looking for a cutter.

## bannister, the eye tech lawyer?
he was out jogging and his heart collapsed.

## eye tech let that footage out?
jennifer bannister won the lawsuit against them... and claimed her husband's implant.

## what are you doing here?
i just wanted to talk.

## do they make any sense?
it all seems so massive and so random.

## have you ever been to a rememory?
no.

## whose?
my ex boyfriend.

## why not?
because it just wasn't...

## what about all the bits in between?
it's a miniature.

## how do you do this?
it's what i was meant to do.

## do you recall any moments with your daughter?
this isn't long ago.

## is that necessary?
there's nothing that any one of you can tell me... that i won't know very soon.

## so... this is him, huh?
that's him.

## caroline, are you all right?
you did very well.

## what's his name?
danny.

## how are you feeling, eliza?
i'm good.

## so, danny, you still drawing?
nope.

## didn't you want to grow up to be an artist?
not anymore.

## what did you want to be, then?
a doctor.

## a doctor, eh?
clever kid.

## why a doctor?
because i want to help people when they're hurt.

## would you listen to this little kid?
you got a good heart, danny.

## it's a strange profession you have, isn't it, alan?
you take people's lives, make lies out of them.

## how can you handle it, alan?
people sleeping and shitting... people stealing from each other... manipulating each other... the obscenity.

## what could i possibly have that you want?
i know you've taken the bannister project... and i want it.

## would you forget the damn code and grow up?
this is real life now.

## hey, did you change the color of our fishing boat?
i would never do that.

## are you sure?
because i remember it being green, not red.

## will you excuse me?
i have to go.

## are you sure that's what happened?
some of us still live by the code, fletcher.

## guilt?
no, i don't have any of those... not as much as you do.

## that part with the partners.
when his son had the mumps?

## could you believe that?
it's the rememory your husband deserved, caroline.

## why are they tattooed like that?
i'm not sure.

## they're so grotesque, aren't they?
sorry about your loss.

## what do you think?
i love it.

## is it keys?
hi, baby.

## you still awake?
no.

## do you want to come down to my study?
i'd like to show you what i'm working on.

## what are you working on?
it's a new case.

## so, how was school today?
good.

## kipper, the sparky dog?
he's a very happy dog.

## can i have a pet?
well, maybe.

## what kind of pet?
maybe a kitty.

## a kitty?
of course.

## yes, sweetie?
i want to go back to bed.

## wasn't she wonderful?
you look lovely, honey.

## would you like one, sir?
no, thank you.

## so, what's your name?
louis.

## yours?
alan.

## that's what you're talking to me about, alan?
well, more than that.

## why do you need me?
there's no place for me with you.

## alan?
alan.

## this?
rather not elaborate.

## how can you make a decision like that?
whittling a life down to one...

## michael, honey, would you run down to the store... and buy us some cigarettes?
we've got eight packs already.

## now... are you all right?
i saw fletcher yesterday.

## really?
yeah.

## what happened to him after he quit?
he seems changed.

## think he could be involved with anti implant groups?
i've heard rumors... talk of them being organized by an ex cutter.

## who is this person?
just someone from my childhood.

## so... how is it that you and i know each other again?
we don't.

## billy who?
don't play games.

## how do you know my name?
i know that you suffocated those kittens when you were 13.

## they say that friends help you move... but good friends help you move bodies, don't they?
i just want what billy wanted.

## please go, ok?
just go.

## is this why you wanted to meet me here?
i thought it would be safer this way.

## how's thelma doing?
i can't give you bannister, and you know i can't.

## will he remember the special moments between them... or moments someone like you decides are special?
my job is to help people remember... what they want to remember, fletcher.

## the right not to pop up in some guy's rememory... without even knowing you were being filmed?
i didn't invent the technology.

## so you want to destroy eye tech with a scandal?
absolutely.

## is this about your sister?
don't even say her name.

## why is your name the first on the list... for cutting scumbags and lowlifes?
because i forgive people long after... they could be punished for their sins.

## do you know what a sin eater is?
it's part of an ancient tradition.

## are you worried about my soul, fletcher?
i will have bannister.

## you see that man behind me?
goodness.

## the pier?
yes, the pier.

## this was during college?
yes, i was in college... and i remember, i looked up at him... and i thought, this is the man...

## a man?
yes.

## mr. hakman, how is this relevant?
minor people i don't even know have no place in the rememory.

## right now?
it would be very helpful.

## remember what i told you?
mr. hakman wants to talk to you about daddy.

## mrs. bannister?
we have a problem with the caterers.

## what's going on in there?
birthday party for mr. froggy.

## do you think mr. froggy would mind... if i took you away from the party for a minute?
ok.

## who's that in your arms?
my doll.

## what's her name?
she doesn't have a name.

## see?
isabel, your daddy...

## can i ask one question?
and then i'm gone.

## was his name louis hunt?
he was my teacher.

## what does he teach?
he doesn't teach anymore.

## did you have a rememory, like for your father?
i don't know.

## are you gonna fix what my daddy can remember?
in a way... yes.

## can you make him forget that i... that i drew on his contract with crayon?
i will.

## will he forget that?
he'll forget.

## there's nobody following us, all right?
this is a really big favor i'm doing for you.

## so, what's this guy's name?
louis hunt.

## would i get you in trouble?
they can track anyone accessing data from a computer, so this is the best i can do.

## how do i use this?
i'm fine.

## what does that mean?
immortality.

## when is the right time to tell your child... about their miraculous gift?
congratulations.

## do they make any sense?
it all seems so massive and so random.

## what happened to you?
i saw something.

## what have you got to eat in this dump?
not much.

## what is this?
some implants have a defect.

## dreams?
yeah, dreams.

## where are you off to, alan?
let's do this.

## you want to do him?
yeah, i'll do him.

## now, you know how this works?
no, not at all.

## do i have to cover my whole face?
no.

## will this hurt?
oh, yeah.

## fletcher?
i'm armed.

## where i get younger and younger?
i had it again.

## i make you happy?
yeah.

## how can you not be happy right now?
i think the first books i read were really, really sad.

## why do they make children's books so sad?
they're always terribly tragic.

## because you saw some proof that i'm to your liking?
no.

## who are you?
please, please, no.

## ok.
who are you, alan?

## well, where is it?
my implant.

## what?
the one in my head.

## you want to take a shot, too?
everybody else has.

## why didn't you tell us, alan?
because i didn't know until i found the files at eye tech.

## how could you not know?
because they died before they told me.

## yeah?
well, that's impossible.

## why should i help you?
if i try it myself, i'll die.

## i can't let you kill yourself, can i?
but you understand, you can never cut again.

## you know exactly which scene you're going to?
i'm all right.

## do you have any idea how close you came?
i saw him.

## looking for this?
the implant's history.

## do you?
he died of a coronary complication.

## or didn't you get to that part yet?
i guess no one will.

## all of it?
all of it.

## you will... waive your fee?
of course.

## what can one do?
accidents will happen.

## isabel, honey, what's the matter?
isabel.

## what's wrong, honey?
isabel.

## a friend?
yeah.

## what now?
word travels fast in my circles.

## will you look at that?
come and get me.

## come on.
daddy?

## you gonna lighten up and be gay for a moment?
it's for the greater good, alan.

## dld i know when i flrst met hlm how nuts he was?
we met at the office of some so called intellectual comedian's agent.

## harvey?
don't ask.

## you pay that troll ten percent of your salary?
20.

## am i right?
yes.

## are you learning disabled?
obviously, you're not familiar with analysis.

## you were in payne whitney?
that's right.

## really?
relax.

## you were in a straitjacket?
i'm not going to take an ax and split your head open.

## and before i knew it, guys from con ed had jumper cables in my head and the rest was...

## why are you in analysis?
you're afraid to sleep alone.

## what's the matter?
i'm in a bad mood.

## why?
i did terribly at an audition today.

## you ate?
i was starving when i got back from the audition, so i had a little sliver of that sara lee cheesecake.

## i finished the spaghetti in the refrigerator, ate that last lobster tail and heated up a chicken pot pie.
you ate the whole sara lee cheesecake?

## is there any furniture left in the house?
i'm so fat, it's disgusting.

## how could you eat before dinner?
i'm sorry.

## why do you always care what other people think?
it's embarrassing ifjust one of us eats.

## i ate them.
what kind of anniversary dinner is that?

## what are you doing?
i made myself a sandwich.

## what?
i'm so angry at her.

## did i miss something?
she left her boyfriend.

## what happened?
i thought she was finally settled.

## more what?
i'm sure she doesn't know.

## why is she coming here?
she has no money.

## in the office, amanda?
that's where i write.

## in the...?
no, amanda.

## everything is in there, okay?
that's my space.

## why didn't you tell me earlier?
i didn't want to ruin your dinner.

## you look so good in those kind of earrings.
do you?

## do i?
beautiful.

## you like them?
you're the only one i've ever dated who's known exactly what to get me.

## you wouldn't consider it?
after we get married, move to the village.

## why is marriage so important?
i just got out of a marriage.

## just because we get a signed piece of paper?
you moved in with me.

## we're a couple, right?
yes, we moved in together.

## bob, how are you?
bob, this is brooke.

## isn't it wonderful?
i think it's brilliant.

## are we busy tomorrow night?
we're taking my parents out.

## didn't i say that exact same thing about frank sinatra?
urban.

## where did you go to school?
they sterilize the sound.

## didn't i say that?
i absolutely agree with you.

## should we?
what do you...

## what was i saying?
i'd love to take one of those boats down the amazon.

## not tonight?
of course not tonight.

## it's malaria, remember?
i don't hate all mosquitoes.

some people get queasy around them, but i think they're beautiful.

great.

## wasn't she great the other night?
so great.

## fat?
i'm sorry.

## did you say fat?
but i have these great diet pills.

## from his record company?
no.

## and you guys got... seriously involved?
no.

## you?
me neither.

## really?
oh, yeah.

## she didn't?
well, that's strange, because that's the only impression to give, really.

## can i do that?
i was actually listening to this last night, and i thought of you.

## you were listening to cole porter and thought of me?
you must really have a crush on me.

## i do?
i'd say it's fatal.

## you did?
yes.

## couldn't you tell, the way i was ignoring you?
well, there was something compelling about your apathy.

## where were you?
it's 10:00.

## where?
well, um, i had a meeting to go to.

## it is?
well, um... that's because i had some wine.

## why?
it's not passover.

## what deal?
i have to tell you, um, it looks like i have a great opportunity to work for, for, um, a very, very funny, uh, puppet.

## is this... is this a woman's hair?
i mean, it could be...

## why can't i tell her the truth?
i'm in love with amanda.

## why can't i leave people?
tell me about your dream.

## the cleveland indians gotjobs at toys r us?
yeah.

## so what can it possibly mean?
look, i can't keep wasting my hour here describing lunatic dreams.

## what do i do?
i have to extricate myself from brooke.

## see?
this is what i get.

## bob wasn't upset when you told him?
everything.

## remember that?
or when we checked into that hotel as s. and z. fitzgerald.

## you know fireside memorial chapel is a mcdonald's now?
fascinating.

## why not?
i can't.

## what do you mean?
it's not natural.

## what did i do to turn you off?
i don't get it.

## grit my teeth, close my eyes, hold myself stiff and let you do it to me?
it's getting to the point where i may settle for that.

## what is it, then?
you know, his professional manner.

## see, even my first wife was...
do you love me?

## you were married?
a bitter story.

## what did you do?
i wanted to grab the check.

## what do you mean?
i did.

## did you hear what that guy said?
three people were coming in as we were leaving.

## the swarthy guy?
yeah.

## how are you?
good.

## how was the comedian?
it's exactly like dobel says.

## when will i meet this polymath?
he is unbelievable.

## mom, could you talk about this tomorrow?
it's late.

## it's past our bedtime?
it's okay.

## why are you so discouraging?
i'm not.

## how?
i could always sing.

## is nobody on my side?
jerry, you could do it.

## what did you call me?
it's a rental.

## could you not be gross?
as the days passed, dobel and i got closer and closer.

## what the hell is that?
falk, if a guy comes out onstage at carnegie hall and throws up, you can always find some people who will call it art.

## what?
i mean, given the circumstances of your sex life, i would think...

## on easter and purim?
i don't really enjoy it.

## does your hand fall asleep?
i happen to think it's a poor substitute for the real thing.

## really?
i prefer it to the real thing.

## a gun?
a gun qualifies as a firearm, yes.

## why would i?
for self defense.

## against who?
against those who conspire to harm you.

## harm me?
don't ask what you did to deserve it.

## what?
they're having a sale here on surplus russian army rifles.

## what?
suppose you're home one night in bed, masturbating, and some guys break in.

## have you ever dialed 911?
it's like trying to get a mortgage.

## are you such a maladroit you can't keep a firearm without discharging it adventitiously?
i don't need a weapon.

## what does that mean?
it means the day will come when you wish you had one.

## why?
so they don't put you in a boxcar.

## what for?
so you can build a survival kit.

## what are you preparing for, the end of civilization?
i have to know if i'm alone in the wilds, i can survive by myself.

## do you keep a loaded gun in the house?
i have a loaded weapon in my house within reach.

## do you hear voices on the radio or worship snakes?
you are a member of one of the most persecuted minorities in history.

## i got you a flashlight that floats if you drop it in the ocean for any reason.
you expecting nazis and a blackout?

## when the hell am i near the ocean?
i want you to build a survival kit.

## why would i need a compass?
this flare gun.

## why?
well, it's for protection.

## what do you mean, from who?
dobel, tell her.

## who do you need protection from?
burglars, rapists, the gestapo.

## you and a rifle?
i know it seems weird.

## what's this stuff?
this is all very important.

## are you joining the boy scouts?
it's all very necessary.

## are these bullets?
they're called rounds.

## right?
jump in here at any point.

## you see?
then i have the empty... empty shell.

## and what i do is i put this now in the breech in the rifle, okay?
so then if a shot's taken, it won't really fire.

## it's his feeling that as the economy slumps, crime rises, okay?
and rape... rape has risen.

## what's happening?
i bought a rifle.

## falk, urgent business in tierra del fuego requires my presence, so i'll be leaving.
mrs. chase, is it unreasonable to own a fire extinguisher, though you'll probably never use it?

## me?
mother, he's a guest.

## would you take these when you go?
i don't care who he is.

## you want me on a park bench?
don't be so dramatic.

## are you going to help me?
i live to serve.

against the wall.

## sir, would you take this?
mom, here you go.

## what'd you think?
it was great.

## how are you?
we're interested in a single room.

## how much is that?
a single room is $200 a night. $200.

## a small suite?
very small.

## how much did you give him?
three bucks.

## five?
he just turned the light on.

## should i have given him five?
it doesn't matter.

## this is fun, isn't it?
it's kind of sexy, being back in a hotel.

## caviar?
you just had all that popcorn at the movie.

## is that what you're thinking about?
no.

## what's wrong?
it's too bright.

## too bright?
okay, well, i can fix that, i guess.

## is that better?
no, it's still too bright.

## there.
really?

## is that better?
no.

## can we start with the lights off?
okay.

## how's that?
thank you.

## you know how sexy you are?
here... let's take off your sweatshirt.

## a clean slate, okay?
we got this room.

## we'll just start over, okay?

## jerry?
jerry, i can't breathe.

## what do you mean?
i can't...

## what do you mean?
i can't breathe.

## why don't you sit down?
amanda, sit down for a second.

## you want me to get you some water?
no.

## amanda, do you want me to open the window?
maybe you need some fresh air.

## are you serious?
i need a doctor.

## just, um, breathe through your nose, okay?
come on.

## so, if i push on your chest here, do you feel any pain?
well, it's right under the breast i get a shooting pain.

## your left breast?
yes.

## have you ever had a reaction like this before?
yes.

## do you have any allergies?
i hope not.

## you take all these pills?
yes.

## you had a few vodkas, you say?
breathe in.

## why do you use diet pills?
i have some trouble with my weight.

## this doesn't hurt, does it?
i'm trapped in a situation here.

## what do i do?
say something.

## why?
i think it's an acting out.

## how are you?
i'm good.

## so, what are you doing here?
i'm having lunch with my manager, inside.

## that harry wexler clown?
i saw him go in.

## lose harvey?
the guy is a joke in the business.

## oh, yeah?
yeah.

## amanda?
she's good.

## so, you want to discuss...?
our new agreement.

## you can't sign that, falk.
i figured, why burden you with signing a contract every three years?

## what are you, a cretin?
i can't not sign it.

## what?
he says it's an acting out.

## what kind of charlatan would want you unarmed in this world?
he's not a charlatan.

## i know you only met her for, like, 15 minutes under pretty chaotic circumstances but she has a great quality, doesn't she?
she's cheating on you, you know.

## you see her with someone?
no.

## did she say something to you?
no.

## then why would you say she's cheating on me?
i can tell by her eyes.

## her eyes?
her eyes.

## is she cheating on me?
dobel has poisoned the well.

## is he some kind of visionary?
not at all.

## jerry?
this is connie.

## what are you working on?
a novel.

## about what?
she always talks about ray polito.

## would you excuse me just a second?
yeah, sure.

## you remember ray polito?
nice to see you.

## how are you?
good.

## you?
i was telling ray about how you have a real interest in old theater posters.

## connie?
you should come, too.

## go where?
my buddy lives in montauk.

## montauk?
it's midnight.

## what could be more romantic?
i can't.

## you play guitar?
yeah.

## what's wrong?
nothing.

## like you were a freshly baked cannoli.
are you crushed because we didn't drive 100 miles to look at theater posters and hear this guy play his guitar?

## connie?
don't pretend you can't remember her name.

## what, is that like a four leaf clover?
i can't sleep.

## you got any pills?
i'm sorry, mother.

## jerry?
come here.

## now?
dobel says we don't choose, our blood chooses for us.

## what does it all add up to if i die?
freud says sex and work.

## hey, paula?
i'm trying to clarify some ideas for my novel.

## could we talk about it later?
i am so nervous.

## where does amanda keep her valium?
there.

## okay, paula?
i went to the bathroom to get her mother a valium.

## why should the thought of amanda sleeping with someone be both excruciating and exciting?
i feel like committing suicide, but i have so many problems, that wouldn't solve them all.

## what do i do?
if it was me, falk, i would follow her.

## why isn't she on the pill?
it's hormonal.

## i don't get it.
the pill makes her crazy?

## where is her diaphragm?
well, you know, i can imagine.

## where is she now?
acting class.

## why don't you come with me?
i can't.

## where were you?
we have theater tickets tonight.

## paula, could you excuse us?
i have to talk to amanda.

## has the president been shot?
fine with me.

## with who?
i must confess.

## where?
at my aa meeting.

## what does he do?
he's a horse whisperer.

## what are you looking for, your keys?
yes.

## would you really care if i got a tattoo?
acting class.

## how?
i was spying on you.

## spying?
that's right.

## it's not here, so where could it be?
there's no such thing as a diaphragm repair shop.

## to punish him?
yeah.

## how can you need me when all these positive feelings happen with everyone but me?
not everybody.

## what am i, kris kringle?
it is a maddening problem.

## where's the rifle?
i'm going to blow my brains out.

## for me?
thank you so much for thinking of me.

## you're not re signing with me?
it's not the end of the world.

## you're dumping me?

## what are you talking about?
you have to go by yourself.

## what?

## you ate?
i was starving when i got back from the audition, so i had a little sliver of that sara lee cheesecake.

## i finished the spaghetti in the refrigerator, ate that last lobster tail and heated up a chicken pot pie.
you ate the whole sara lee cheesecake?

## is there any furniture left in the house?
i'm so fat, it's disgusting.

## how could you eat before dinner?
i'm sorry.

## why do you always care what other people think?
it's embarrassing if just one of us eats.

## can i have one dinner, and can you put a steak in a doggie bag?
i thought we'd sit over some wine and i'd look in your eyes and tell you how beautiful you are.

## what are you doing?
i made myself a sandwich.

## what?
i'm so angry at her.

## did i miss something?
she left her boyfriend.

## what happened?
i thought she was finally settled.

## more what?
i'm sure she doesn't know.

## why is she coming here?
she has no money.

## in the office, amanda?
that's where i write.

## in the...?
no, amanda.

## everything is in there, okay?
that's my space.

## why didn't you tell me earlier?
i didn't want to ruin your dinner.

## you're making matters worse, okay?
you're giving me a migraine.

## you think there's a reason you never made it?
no tact.

## can i ring you back?
i was up to nbc.

## what do you mean?
there's nothing to get anxious about.

## jerry, do you think i'm fat?
i think you're amazing looking.

## losers?

## something for me?
this is for you.

## you look so good in those kind of earrings.
do you?

## you wouldn't consider it?
after we get married, move to the village.

i just got out of a marriage.

## just because we get a signed piece of paper?
you moved in with me.

yes, we moved in together.

## bob, how are you?
bob, this is brooke.

## how's it going?
falk and brooke.

## so, what are you guys doing down here?

## lsn't it wonderful?
i think it's brilliant.

## are we busy tomorrow night?
we're taking my parents out.

## didn't i say that exact same thing about frank sinatra?
urban.

## where did you go to school?
they sterilize the sound.

## didn't i say that?
i absolutely agree with you.

## should we?
what do you...

## what was i saying?
i'd love to take one of those boats down the amazon.

## not tonight?
of course not tonight.

## it's malaria, remember?
i don't hate all mosquitoes.

## do i like snakes?
some people get queasy around them, but i think they're beautiful.

## don't you have an audition tomorrow?
edna millay...

## amanda's pretty, isn't she?
she's okay, i suppose.

## hmm?
nothing.

## oh, yeah?
they make a nice couple.

## are you okay?
yeah.

## amanda?
hey, it's jerry falk.

## you?
listen, i was just about to go to this old record store i found out about.

## what was i thinking?
i could be there pretty soon.

## maybe, say, three minutes?
great.

## wasn't she great the other night?
so great.

## fat?
i'm sorry.

## did you say fat?
but i have these great diet pills.

## from his record company?
no.

## and you guys got... seriously involved?
no.

## you?
me neither.

## really?
oh, yeah.

## she didn't?
well, that's strange, because that's the only impression to give, really.

## can i do that?
i was actually listening to this last night, and i thought of you.

## you were listening to cole porter and thought of me?
you must really have a crush on me.

## i do?
i'd say it's fatal.

## you did?
yes.

## couldn't you tell, the way i was ignoring you?
well, there was something compelling about your apathy.

## where were you?
it's 1 0:00.

## where?
well, um, i had a meeting to go to.

## it is?
well, um... that's because i had some wine.

## why?
it's not passover.

## what deal?
i have to tell you, um, it looks like i have a great opportunity to work for, for, um, a very, very funny, uh, puppet.

## is this... is this a woman's hair?
i mean, it could be...

## why can't i tell her the truth?
i'm in love with amanda.

## why can't i leave people?
tell me about your dream.

## the cleveland lndians got jobs at toys r us?
yeah.

## so what can it possibly mean?
look, i can't keep wasting my hour here describing lunatic dreams.

## what do i do?
i have to extricate myself from brooke.

## see?
this is what i get.

## bob wasn't upset when you told him?
everything.

## remember that?
or when we checked into that hotel as s. and z. fitzgerald.

## you know fireside memorial chapel is a mcdonald's now?
fascinating.

## why not?
i can't.

## what do you mean?
it's not natural.

## what did i do to turn you off?
i don't get it.

## grit my teeth, close my eyes, hold myself stiff and let you do it to me?
it's getting to the point where i may settle for that.

## what is it, then?
you know, his professional manner.

## just because i pull away when you touch me?
falk, give me a break.

## you were married?
a bitter story.

## what did you do?
i wanted to grab the check.

## what do you mean?
i did.

## did you hear what that guy said?
three people were coming in as we were leaving.

## the swarthy guy?
yeah.

## hi.
did you hear that?

## how are you?
good.

## how was the comedian?
it's exactly like dobel says.

## when will i meet this polymath?
he is unbelievable.

## mom, could you talk about this tomorrow?
it's late.

## it's past our bedtime?
it's okay.

## why are you so discouraging?
i'm not.

## how?
i could always sing.

## is nobody on my side?
jerry, you could do it.

## what did you call me?
it's a rental.

## could you not be gross?
as the days passed, dobel and i got closer and closer.

## what the hell is that?
falk, if a guy comes out onstage at carnegie hall and throws up, you can always find some people who will call it art.

## what?
i mean, given the circumstances of your sex life, i would think...

## on easter and purim?
i don't really enjoy it.

## does your hand fall asleep?
i happen to think it's a poor substitute for the real thing.

## really?
i prefer it to the real thing.

## a gun?
a gun qualifies as a firearm, yes.

## why would l?
for self defense.

## against who?
against those who conspire to harm you.

## harm me?
don't ask what you did to deserve it.

## what?
they're having a sale here on surplus russian army rifles.

## what?
suppose you're home one night in bed, masturbating, and some guys break in.

## have you ever dialed 91 1?
it's like trying to get a mortgage.

## are you such a maladroit you can't keep a firearm without discharging it adventitiously?
i don't need a weapon.

## what does that mean?
it means the day will come when you wish you had one.

## why?
so they don't put you in a boxcar.

## what for?
so you can build a survival kit.

## what are you preparing for, the end of civilization?
i have to know if i'm alone in the wilds, i can survive by myself.

## do you keep a loaded gun in the house?
i have a loaded weapon in my house within reach.

## do you hear voices on the radio or worship snakes?
you are a member of one of the most persecuted minorities in history.

## i got you a flashlight that floats if you drop it in the ocean for any reason.
you expecting nazis and a blackout?

## when the hell am i near the ocean?
i want you to build a survival kit.

## why would i need a compass?
this flare gun.

## why?
well, it's for protection.

## what do you mean, from who?
dobel, tell her.

## who do you need protection from?
burglars, rapists, the gestapo.

## you and a rifle?
i know it seems weird.

## what's this stuff?
this is all very important.

## are you joining the boy scouts?
it's all very necessary.

## are these bullets?
they're called rounds.

## right?
jump in here at any point.

## you see?
then i have the empty... empty shell.

## and what i do is i put this now in the breech in the rifle, okay?
so then if a shot's taken, it won't really fire.

## it's his feeling that as the economy slumps, crime rises, okay?
and rape... rape has risen.

## what's happening?
i bought a rifle.

## falk, urgent business in tierra del fuego requires my presence, so i'll be leaving.
mrs. chase, is it unreasonable to own a fire extinguisher, though you'll probably never use it?

## me?
mother, he's a guest.

## would you take these when you go?
i don't care who he is.

## you want me on a park bench?

a single room is $200 a night. $200.

## a small suite?
very small.

## how much did you give him?
three bucks.

## five?
he just turned the light on.

## should i have given him five?
it doesn't matter.

## this is fun, isn't it?
it's kind of sexy, being back in a hotel.

## caviar?
you just had all that popcorn at the movie.

## is that what you're thinking about?
no.

## what's wrong?
it's too bright.

## too bright?
okay, well, i can fix that, i guess.

## are you serious?
i need a doctor.

## just, um, breathe through your nose, okay?

i have some trouble with my weight.

## this doesn't hurt, does it?
i'm trapped in a situation here.

## what do i do?
say something.

## why?
i think it's an acting out.

## how are you?
i'm good.

## so, what are you doing here?

i saw him go in.

## so, you want to discuss...?
no big deal.

## what's this?

i can't not sign it.

## what?
he says it's an acting out.

## what kind of charlatan would want you unarmed in this world?
he's not a charlatan.

## i know you only met her for, like, 1 5 minutes under pretty chaotic circumstances but she has a great quality, doesn't she?
she's cheating on you, you know.

## you see her with someone?
no.

## did she say something to you?
no.

## then why would you say she's cheating on me?
i can tell by her eyes.

## her eyes?
her eyes.

the absolute terror of confronting one's death.

i went to the bathroom to get her mother a valium.

## why should the thought of amanda sleeping with someone be both excruciating and exciting?
i feel like committing suicide, but i have so many problems, that wouldn't solve them all.

## what do i do?
if it was me, falk, i would follow her.

## why isn't she on the pill?
it's hormonal.

## i don't get it.

## she didn't?
well, that's strange, because that's the only impression to give, really.

## can i do that?
i was actually listening to this last night, and i thought of you.

## you were listening to cole porter and thought of me?
you must really have a crush on me.

## i do?
i'd say it's fatal.

## you did?
yes.

## it is?
well, um... that's because i had some wine.

## ls this... is this a woman's hair?
i mean, it could be...

## why can't i tell her the truth?
i'm in love with amanda.

## why can't i leave people?
tell me about your dream.

## the cleveland lndians gotjobs at toys r us?
yeah.

## so what can it possibly mean?
look, i can't keep wasting my hour here describing lunatic dreams.

## what do i do?
i have to extricate myself from brooke.

## see?
this is what i get.

## bob wasn't upset when you told him?
everything.

## remember that?
or when we checked into that hotel as s. and z. fitzgerald.

## you know fireside memorial chapel is a mcdonald's now?
fascinating.

## why not?
i can't.

## what do you mean?
it's not natural.

## what did i do to turn you off?
i don't get it.

## grit my teeth, close my eyes, hold myself stiff and let you do it to me?
it's getting to the point where i may settle for that.

## what is it, then?

jerry, you could do it.

## what did you call me?
it's a rental.

## could you not be gross?
as the days passed, dobel and i got closer and closer.

## what the hell is that?
falk, if a guy comes out onstage at carnegie hall and throws up, you can always find some people who will call it art.

## what?
i mean, given the circumstances of your sex life, i would think...

## on easter and purim?
i don't really enjoy it.

## does your hand fall asleep?
i happen to think it's a poor substitute for the real thing.

## really?
i prefer it to the real thing.

a gun qualifies as a firearm, yes.

## why would l?
for self defense.

## against who?
against those who conspire to harm you.

## harm me?

## what?
they're having a sale here on surplus russian army rifles.

## what?
suppose you're home one night in bed, masturbating, and some guys break in.

## have you ever dialed 91 1?
it's like trying to get a mortgage.

## are you such a maladroit you can't keep a firearm without discharging it adventitiously?
i don't need a weapon.

## what does that mean?
it means the day will come when you wish you had one.

## why?
so they don't put you in a boxcar.

so you can build a survival kit.

## what are you preparing for, the end of civilization?
i have to know if i'm alone in the wilds, i can survive by myself.

## do you keep a loaded gun in the house?

## when the hell am i near the ocean?
i want you to build a survival kit.

## why would i need a compass?
this flare gun.

## why?
well, it's for protection.

## what do you mean, from who?
dobel, tell her.

## who do you need protection from?
burglars, rapists, the gestapo.

## you and a rifle?
i know it seems weird.

## what's this stuff?
this is all very important.

## are you joining the boy scouts?
it's all very necessary.

## are these bullets?
they're called rounds.

## right?
jump in here at any point.

## you see?
then i have the empty... empty shell.

## and what i do is i put this now in the breech in the rifle, okay?
so then if a shot's taken, it won't really fire.

## it's his feeling that as the economy slumps, crime rises, okay?
and rape... rape has risen.

## what's happening?
i bought a rifle.

## falk, urgent business in tierra del fuego requires my presence, so i'll be leaving.

it'll make you feel sexy, jerry.

## does it make you feel sexy?
my mother fed me cheerios.

## how do you know so much about him?
well, he was interesting to talk to.

## so you're saying you're on the defensive because you wouldn't snort cocaine?
it's not the cocaine.

## what principle?
and, you know, she's not entirely wrong.

## what is this?
you don't want to know.

## what is it, a monologue for some alleged comedian who thinks to be offensive is in itself enough to be funny?
i wish it were.

## what is it?
my contract extension with harvey.

## you don't understand, okay?
lf i don't re up with him, he will truly die.

## at lsabella's.

## lf what you need are bathroom jokes, he can do them.
are you insane?

## what's wrong with your voice?
we should talk.

harvey... there's no question that you were there for me from the start.

## you're not re signing with me?
it's not the end of the world.

## you're dumping me?
no, not dumping.

payment by cash each time.

## what does it mean to be strong?
i don't know.

## what do you think she said?
she said i was cruel.

## what is it to be strong, and what is it to be gentle?
i didn't know.

## who is to blame for losing her mother?

after that we had a very, very long talk.

## dumb, isn't it?
i was cooking, and kept on waitng for her.

## wouldn't they even tell you where she was buried?
the letters i sent to her parents were all returned unopened.

## you don't care if you're alive or dead?

well, then youre all set.

## can you lift me?
but klaus, you do know that lifting people on the fork is not allowed.

## say, did you see my cutter somewhere?
nope.

## where did i put it?
then slowly drive forward and set down the load.

## what, it doesn't work?
let me have a look, im good with mechanical things.

## do you remember?
one doesn't even need to be handy in order to fix this.

## but klaus, dont you think such load needs to be secured to prevent it from slipping off or falling off the fork?
therefore, everything that can easily slip off the fork has to be secured.

## what's it gonna be?
look at that.

## want the dinosaur?
come on, let's have a little fight.

## david, what's going on?
i gotta talk to you, edith.

## bruce.

i switched over.

## what do you want?

## how'd you like to come work for atheon... get paid 10 times as much as you are now... and own a piece of the patents?

## general?

## why isn't he going through nsc?
it concerns your daughter, sir.

## he's not working the night shift?
benny's dead.

## what's the matter?

## do you think it's just a dream?
no, i think it's something that happened... when i was living at a desert base with my father.

## what's your name, darling?
okay.

## what's he doing here?
you know, dr. krenzler... we've never had the chance to get to know each other properly.

## do l?
yes.

## are you there?

## so call me, okay?
i gotta talk to you.

## bruce?
there was some sort of explosion.

## what happened to you last night?
i had the most vivid dream.

## were you at the lab?
no.

## who?
that new janitor.

## what?
your friend in there... there's a good chance he's caught up in some bad business.

## and that's for the new guy on the night shift?
great.

## he told you?
he said you talked to him.

## i'm sorry?
don't be sorry.

## and a very beautiful woman like you... your attentions... can't be completely unwanted... can they?
no.

## so, you're just not gonna tell me where he is, are you?
how many times must i tell you...

## you know who i am, right, banner?
you're betty's father, a high ranking general.

## lf you had him tossed away, why ask me?
some more repressed memories.

## bruce?

i had a visit today.

## you so much want to know, don't you?

## and passed on to me, what?
an alteration.

my father sent them.

## ls there anything from when you were changed?
it was like a dream.

## about what?
rage.

## betty, are you all right?
i'm scared.

## how are you?
okay, i guess.

## how could it?
we designed them to respond to physical damage.

## like what?
serious trauma.

## he did?
it sounded bad... but i honestly don't remember.

## you know what scares me the most?
ls that when it happens... when it comes over me and i totally lose control...

## i'm gonna take you someplace safe, okay?
bruce.

## how long are you gonna keep him sedated?
for the rest of his natural life, if i have to.

## suppose he gets out... and has one of his little mood swings in a populated area?
yes, i'm aware of the potential danger.

## why is he such a threat to you?
because i know what he comes from.

## predestined to follow in his father's footsteps?
of course you were.

## what's happening here?

## you're citing case laws to support this insanity?
we got married last night for goodness sake.

## what?
we can't be married and be opposing counselors.

## can i say something?
we'll look ridiculous.

## why not?
we'll be the laughing stock of the new york bar association because you will say something contrary just to be contrary.

## you see what i mean?
you just broke the little fella's leg right off.

## well, why don't you just file here if that's what you want?
oh, that's a great idea.

## rafferty, you say?
yeah.

## were you meant to be with him?
yes, i was.

## and are you?
i was.

## you're always saying that you have to fight to save a marriage and not give in, right?
yes.

## do you really believe that?
yes, i do... very much.

## counselor woods, i'd like to ask you a question, if i may.
why?

## will you love him, keep him, honor him and protect him, and forsaking all others, be loyal only to him?
i will.

## do you want to be the only man ever held in contempt at his own wedding?
no, your honor.

## counselor daniel rafferty, do you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife?
will you love her...

## how can i refuse?
you know, you folks may want to close the sunroof.

## what?
my skin is always better when i'm dating.

## oh my god, is this it?
it's an extraordinary townhouse with a total floor space of 9, 000 square feet, not including the garden.

## may i ask what you do?
it depends on the occasion.

## and your friend?
i'm just along for the ride.

## what was hanging there?
uh, john sargent.

## that much?
oh my god.

## know what, sara?
i don't think this is the place for you.

## cramped?
well, it was all i could think of.

## where's the pleasure?
winning.

## is it bad?
no, it doesn't mean anything.

## a new attorney who has never practiced in new york will never get up to speed this late in the game, okay?
you have nothing to worry about.

## that's gary's new attorney?
audrey woods.

## i realize you're just starting to familiarize yourself with the case, but i wanted to make you aware that... what?
er, you got a little... right here.

## ms. woods, is it?
hey, daniel.

## uh, you mean, um, paintings, sculpture, that kind of stuff?
exactly.

## paintings like this?
actually, yes.

## and what have we here?
oh, john sargent.

## six months for sexual addiction?
my therapist was very good.

## you want him dead?
oh, mother.

## what are you eating?

## hey, you looking to die, lady?
audrey woods.

## small world, eh?
and another counselor kind enough to step in at the last minute.

## do you always look like an unmade bed?
uh oh.

## which is it?
i'll give you hint.

## what are you doing here?
at least you could be a bit more grateful.

## grateful for what?
well, my old friend lyman over there needed a replacement.

## you?
mmm.

## like a nibble?
you raise some interesting points.

## no?
and now, let's hear from daniel rafferty.

## any sno bits?
hi.

## hmm?
don't ask.

## don't you think the clarity is wonderful?
i'm sure you people at the back can see all the roses on our suspect's scarf.

## wouldn't you agree?
remember, none of us are in divorce law for love.

## are you crazy?
sure, but i'm also your mother... when we're not in public.

## why?
you haven't done anything wrong.

## don't you usually just break and enter?
hysterical.

## if you review your surveillance tape... you know, just how paranoid are you by the way?
you'll notice that your office was open and my intention was to have a meeting.

## you, uh, sustained an injury?
i broke a nail.

## excuse me?
let's meet over dinner.

## and since you initiated it, protocol dictates that you should take me, don't you think?
no, no, no, no, no.

## ah, dos huevos de chivo, por favor.
could you be more fascinating?

## with the huevo?
oh, s.

## it's so romantic, no?
no.

## well, don't you ever just want to slap your clients, tell them to go home and sort it out?
actually, no, i don't.

## i see?
yep.

## you see?
yes, i do.

## what kind of a segue is that?
i don't think you are.

## you see that i couldn't be dating anyone?
i could be dating, mister.

## trust me, okay?
you're not dating.

## why not?
okay, since you ask...

## what is dating anyway?
intelligent.

## trial marriage?
i thought you just said marriage was dead in the water.

## you dating anyone?
i thought you just closed that subject.

## you mean, apart from tonight?
this isn't a date.

## seriously?
yes, seriously.

## but can't we reach a compromise, call it an intimate meeting?
intimacy doesn't change a thing.

## there are no psychoanalytical shortcuts into my pants, okay?
dos huevos de chivos.

## no umbrella?
huevo de chivo.

## i just had a goat's nut in my mouth?
no, it's a cherry.

## too strong for you?
not at all.

## really?
yeah.

## 65 ?
i mean, if you'd said 85 or 90...

## yeah, you and her, what's up with that?
oh, my mouth has gone numb.

## can you?
i felt that okay.

## oh my god.
you?

## cup of coffee?
due in court, 45 minutes.

## the dryer?
i wore panties.

## did i do anything last night i might regret?
i hope not.

## what's wrong?
i mean, you always say i look like crap.

## don't you like it?
tie looks good.

## what?
because that was not your position last night, assuming you remember last night's... position.

## oh, what did you say?
it was brilliant.

## in which all bets are off.
please, just let me explain, all right?

## you don't get it, do you?
i just paid you the ultimate compliment.

## compliment?
you forced me to fight dirtier in there than i've ever had to do before.

## like the apology you gave me last night?
okay, i was trying to soften you up.

## are you wounded, mr. rafferty?
hey, hey, hey, last night was very special.

## bagged?

## do you want to tell me about it?
you're very young.

## are you serena?
so your husband is...

## the fathead on stage?
yeah.

## you've never had a goat's nut?
i can't say that i have.

## do you think that's really a goat's nut in there?
oh, ms. woods, look at that.

## would you like to join us?
ah, i just wanted to say hello to serena.

## well, who isn't?
uh, serena, audrey woods.

## oh, you do?
oh well, i guess these things hit the papers.

## what?
that's a good look, counselor.

## did you practice that in the mirror?
hey, i decided to use someone else.

i called the realtor right away, yeah.

## galahad, do you still not know the romans?
they won't scratch their asses without holding a ceremony.

## why don't you just kill him, and then discharge yourself after?
i don't kill for pleasure, unlike some.

## what will i do?
it's different for galahad.

## won't you, dag?
first thing i will do when i get home is find a beautiful sarmatian woman to wed.

## i see.
a beautiful sarmatian woman?

wondering at your good fortune that all your children look like me.

i saw his image in your room.

## saxons?

oh, pray to whomever you pray that we don't cross the saxons.

## why do you challenge this?
i don't like anything that puts a man on his knees.

## without faith, without belief in something, what are we?
to try and get past the woads in the north is insanity.

## do you believe in this mission?
outnumbered, outflanked, yet still we triumph.

## what other purpose do we serve if not for such a cause?
arthur, you fight for a world that will never exist.

## why do you think i spared you in the forest?
you have a choice.

## i can't take you.
have you ever seen one?

## i can't handle myself as well as a man?
no.

## you from the caves?
probably never seen a god.

## what do you know about gods?
we've seen gods.

## are you sure this was a god?
i thought you said you believe what you can see.

## get off my brother.
so if you were stupid enough to leave a good woman behind...... why don't you tell me where she is so i can go get her for myself?

## what's he saying?
don't know.

## who's responsible for allowing him to run around?
he shot the wrangler.

## really?
show me.

## sir?
reach for the gun.

## does all of earth look like this?
i'm afraid so, sir.

## what is this species?
dog.

## but have you looked at my file?
it explicitly says that this is a temporary assignment.

## are you not aware that i graduated top of my class?
quite an accomplishment.

## so now we're escaping?
i am.

## i've wasted my time, haven't l?
if you're going to lie to me, have the decency to do a credible job...... so i don't look like an idiot for training you.

## what?
we use picto cameras to spy on other offices.

## my most trusted colleague?
of course not.

## what mutiny?
the one you're going to pretend is in the works...... iike your life depended on it.

## have you blown a head gasket?
i will be the laughingstock of the universe.

## what do you mean, we?
it's my plan.

## how do i even know you understand the plan?
we train man animals who don't need breath gas...... to mine the gold for us.

## education, huh?
never engage in a criminal activity unless you have a patsy to pin it on...... in case you ever get found out.

## but why do i have to be the patsy?
so you don't get any bright ideas to get rid of terl...... and keep the gold for yourself.

## over a man animal?
man is a primitive species...... so we'll need something primitive for leverage.

## how the crap should i know?
there's no way of knowing that.

## what is it?
food.

## you, floyd?
plenty to burn.

## don't you know anything?
the leader of the pack always eats first.

## see?
we're really going to have leverage over them now.

## what are you doing?
they know about the camera.

## what are you thinking, jonnie?
they made me do this before.

## yes?
obviously, this is going to take a while.

## monsters?
they're called psychlos.

## what did they do to him?
they made him look into a light, a god machine.

## so this is the monster's language?
no, no.

## equal to what?
to each other.

## see, a wing, see?
and line and form and artistic composition.

## what's an identification number?
there.

## how many numbers is that?
eight.

## eight?
eight.

## the question is, how clever?
hope is an admirable quality, but foolish isn't.

## do you want lunch?
it's obviously too much to ask a man animal...... to learn a language as sophisticated as psychlo.

## what the hell for?
i don't know.

## what if this one is particularly stupid?
maybe we should train another one.

## you can look at anything you want...... because there is nothing that will help you.
how exactly do you plan to do that?

## satisfied?
yes.

## that's it?
yes.

## what about those we're leaving behind?
there's nothing we can do.

## do you?
you can't defeat them.

## you don't know her?
someone knows how to speak the psychlo's language.

## really?
she's stupid enough not to be a menace, pretty enough to be decorative.

## don't you have some work to do?
no.

## ker?
all right, sir.

## which was?
you said we'd have a huge house when we go back to psychlo next year.

## we're going to be rich, right?
right.

## did it?
that.

## you can?
oh, yes.

## what the hell does the planetship need with all this mining equipment?
that's not even the crazy part.

## man animals being able to mine?
yes.

## but what can i do?
an order is an order.

## how's your side?
it's good.

## what about the big uglies watching us with that eye in the sky?
carlo, look.

## here's the men, right?
we split them in half.

## i'm gonna blow the dome?
you're gonna blow the dome.

## what is that?
thousands of gas drones and troops will be teleported here.

## then what's the point?
if they send more monsters to earth, we get wiped out.

## their home planet?
their home planet.

## is everyone clear?
count us in.

## can you teach your men to fly this?
i think i found one.

## what happens if we do?
the bomb will explode.

## what does the auto sensor look like?
there's an illustration in appendix a.

## what?
we don't have appendix a.

## i thought you said nuclear fires were powerful?
it's not nuclear.

## will this be enough to blow up their whole planet?
radiation reacts with their planet's atmosphere.

## why is it in bars?
i assumed, sir...... that a psychlo of your refinement wouldn't want raw ore.

## really?
since you have had extra time...... to smelt it into bricks...... i'll expect the rest of the gold in seven days.

## do you, ker?
no.

## how do you know about those recordings?
it really is amazing...... the collection of discs you find in terl's personal vault.

## you want to trade?
after tonight, won't matter much either way.

## children?
there's no time.

## you're not upset?
don't be crazy.

## you know how long i've waited for this day?
i know the perfect way to celebrate.

## what are you doing?
you can't shoot me.

## how about giving your old teacher a clue as to who this might be?
you insult yourself, sir.

## how am i supposed to know who it is?
i don't know.

## greener?
carlo.

## it's carlo.
can i blow the dome?

## what's going on?
talk to me.

## what's with the dome?
hold on, i'm taking it out now.

## where's the rest of my gold?
i'll exchange it for my woman's life.

## now, where is it?
trust me, you don't want to do that.

## why don't you vaporize me?
since i'm teaching them our technology, they made me the head psychlo.

## what are you asking him for?
i mean he was worse at disciplining those kids than you are.

## how bad do they have to be?
yeah.

## whose last name did you put on the application?
yours.

## can i go?
i worked in a farm growing up.

## oh, yeah?
give me a hint, earl, like......, has funnel cakes.

## does not have funnel cakes...?

yeah, of course...

## why wouldn't i be?
earl... that was a rooster that's a man chicken they're the meanest of them all.

probably...

## there's no way to cross you off.
i can't cross you off the list.! you mean your idiot list?

## what?
when someone tells the truth, and says they're sorry, you forgive them.

## i forgive you.
if these little monster kids could forgive me why couldn't i forgive my own brother?

## what?
i know you're sorry for what you did back, then and when somebody you love is sorry you forgive em.

please leave a message.

## are you watching, johnny boy?
i hope you're paying close attention.

## what?

## that's dutch?
that's what he said.

## this now?
this is mumbo jumbo, gibberish.

## who is it?
it's detective john hobbes.

## may i come in?
sure.

## why do you want to know about my father?
it's 30 years later and the files are sealed...... and my boss was told to let it alone, so...... here i am.

## just curious, or...?
no, ma'am.

## did reese like to sing?
yeah, he did, actually.

## and at the execution, did he try and touch you or grab you?
yeah, he did.

## do you want some coffee?
sure.

## will i get a cup of coffee if i say yes?
detective, my dad was a good cop.

## so you're saying that when he died someone made this evidence go away?
the mayor, the governor and the chief of police, they all needed a hero.

## how do you know he was innocent?
it was 30 years ago.

## don't you want the truth to come out, the killer to be punished?
of course, i do.

## are you afraid that if you tell me your life may be in danger?
yeah.

## that's it?
yes.

## if i have any more questions, can i call you?
i'd rather you didn't.

## do you believe in god?
yeah.

## what was she hiding?
what was she so scared of?.

## what the hell is that all about?
you never know.

## or is it nothing?
nothing at all.

## hello?
let's go, sam.

## do you ever get scared?
yeah, sometimes.

## mrs. moohr?
this is charles.

## am i working tonight?
you quit.

## i quit?
yes.

## how...?
look, i'm really sorry....

## hello?
well, well, well.

## prelim?
said it sounded mideastern.

## anything on muskavich?
only the pizza.

## now, we're hitting your area of expertise, huh?
pizza is a staff of life.

## detectives?
your guy's in video.

## any luck?
john hobbes, professor richard louders.

## how do you do?
pleasure.

## can i speak to him?
not now.

## meaning?
some kind of antique.

## so you don't know what he's saying?
i haven't the faintest.

## he's not too pleasant, is he?
but if you'd spare me a copy, i'd be more than happy to work it.

## what are you saying, hobbes?
reese pulled off some of the sickest shit on record.

## hey, pal, need another clue?
1339 south grove...... apartment 9.

## is that close to grove?
i think so.

## cash, not a check?
that's right.

## you know what's scary?
i'm going home last night, this guy's walking past me, he's going the other way.

## you know what i mean?
it's the same guy that's in the bathtub.

## same poison?
same poison.

## what else have you got?
the number on his chest.

## last thursday it's 18, now it's 2?
everything's under a charles olom, but it looks like that's an alias.

## you mean reese?
yeah.

## how is he ever?
he's fine.

## if it starts to work at him, let me know, okay?
and if it starts to work on me, i'll let you know.

## what are you doing, more...... historical research?
nice talking to you.

## uncle john, but he's a spaz.
how're you doing?

## you understand me?
cherish what you got.

## want to come with us?
i didn't bring my shoes.

## you know how weird this case is?
we got a positive l. d...... on charles olom.

## what?
let's see, noons poisons muskavich...... dumps him in the tub, sets out the corn flakes.

## some kind of ringmaster?
i think so.

## you and sam don't forget lunch, all right?
i don't know.

## beautiful, isn't it?
yes, it is.

## say again?
if you enjoy your life...... if there's even one human being you care about, don't take this case.

## that's it?
yeah, i'm afraid so.

## see those calls there?
they were made right around the time they were killed.

## you're saying the killer called me from the crime scene?
sure looks like it.

## how many times have i got to change my phone number?
the more you change it, the more it looks like someone on the inside.

## like a cop?
yeah.

## you hear me?
both ears.

## what've you got?
i can't enter you by touch.

## anything else?
no, i'm okay.

## tell me when to stop, okay?
okay.

## can you pronounce it for me again?
okay, professor, i think i got it.

## you're releasing a richard suckle?
he called a cab.

## what about it?
looked like a map in there.

## are you going somewhere?
i went up to the country.

## fresh air, you know?
i used to do that.

## why do you ask?
no, i don't.

## azazel.
you don't know what i'm talking about?

## from milano's place?
you found something up there.

## like what?
if you know, you should never, ever tell.

## what are you talking about?
you were singing.

## i appreciate your situation, okay?
i really do.

## do you believe this stuff?
i believe more is hidden than is seen.

## what else did reese say?
i'm asking the questions here.

## who the hell are they?
there are certain phenomena...... which can only be explained if there is a god...... and if there are angels.

## that's it?
come on, get out of here.

## miss milano, i'm just a cop, okay?
i'm a detective.

## at the time you knew him, he was not himself.
aren't your facts here rather resistant to normal interpretation?

## he was azazel?
yes, azazel.

## why does he focus in on me?
you got his attention.

## how do we fight him? ls it possible?
i believe it is.

## you're saying i'm one of these people?
i don't know.

## they can be killed?
by the right person.

## who is?
this is religion, mr. hobbes.

## it could be you, me, anybody?
the right person of the right character with the right knowledge....

## can i ask you something personal?
everything's personal if you're a person.

## is this why you live alone?
there's a difference between risking for yourself and someone else.

## you're a friend of john hobbes, right?
i'm jay reynolds.

## you know?
how lovely.

## have we met?
thanks for coming.

## you know what it is?
i never believed this day would come.

## do they know who you are?
we shouldn't be seen together.

## how're you doing?
fine.

## murders not getting you wound up?
bag the chocolates.

## am i a suspect?
sit down.

## i committed murder, then called home, then ran home and answered my phone?
no, it's something else.

## on what?
on that fucking little coin of yours.

## where?
shit.

## is it?
anybody could have got those coins.

## you remember robert milano?
listen to me.

## you know what i mean?
you saw it before, but now...... it's in your face, laughing at you.

## how're you doing?
hi, mr. hobbes.

## what?

## who hit you in the eye?

## why?
you came after me.

## toby, you all right?
come on, hobbes.

## what'll you tell stanton?
i'd love to hear that one.

## why don't you just kill me?
but i'm still having fun.

## aren't you still having fun?
he was standing in the street, yelling at him...... shooting at him.

## there's no question that the dead man shot first?
no question at all.

## what am i going to do?
we know that he fired first.

## a setup?
that's right.

## excuse me.
he set it up for you to kill him?

## what the hell are you doing out here?
you take sam home, lock every door, every window....

## can you remember that?
all right, do it.

## are you mad at me or something?
no, art.

## hate to see the mighty fall, you know what i mean?
now it's letters.

## the killer's sending a message?
hobbes....

## coffee?
no, thanks.

## want to talk?
from where i sit, we're dealing with shit that ain't in the manual.

## what's the point of life?
yeah.

## you want a cigarette?
no, thanks.

## why do we even exist?
us.

## if there's a greater being than we are, why does he give a shit about us?
there are five billion of us.

## do we care...... what ants do, from a moral standpoint?
no.

## are you heading someplace here?
that's my point.

## are we headed someplace?
if we don't figure it out....

## what's that?
it's different.

## and just one thing, not two or...?
maybe two, i don't know.

## so, like this could be it for me?
that's the beauty.

## is that you?
hi.

## what do they want, gretta?
just tell me what they want.

## the demons?
they want the fall of civilization.

## the whole thing?
yeah.

## they're doing a goodjob, aren't they?
you know, after i shot the teacher...... azazel moved to someone else.

## after death?
i'm positive.

## a cubit, that's a distance or something, right?
from your elbow to your fingertips.

## about a sixth of a mile?
yeah, well, you're right then.

## what are you thinking?
i don't know.

## are you okay?
yeah.

## were you asleep when i tucked you in?
i don't know.

## where's your father?
in the bedroom.

## have you seen the news?
the cop was shooting first.

## lou?
no.

## they get him yet?
no.

## are you ready?
almost.

## what's going on here?
we're just going to play a little trick on somebody.

## what about my dad?
he's sleeping.

## how're you doing?
good.

## you mean like the book of the bible?
yes.

## any special kind?
no, any kind.

## detective hobbes?
i thought you quit.

## you know what's going on?
the police think that i did some bad things.

## why do they think you did that?
because....

## he's not asleep, is he?
no, son.

## did it hurt?
i don't think so.

## do you think he's gonna go to heaven?
yes.

## after the host body dies...... the demon can survive for one breath or 500 cubits, right?
at the same time...... azazel says to me when he moves as spirit no man can resist.

## will you take him somewhere...... nobody knows about?
even me.

## you understand?
i'm gonna go back to sleep...... and when i wake up everything is gonna be just the way it was.

## you know what this means, right?
i'm ready.

## hey, jonesy, how're you doing?
look, i'm worried, man.

## where are you gonna go?
i'm going nowhere.

## yeah, remember what we were talking about the other night?
when the moment comes...... you know it.

## be careful, okay?
i'll see you, partner.

## what am i doing?
this is where things get a little tricky.

## haven't you done enough?
you made me kill an innocent man.

## what are you talking about?
i didn't do any of that.

## who'd you expect it'd be?
now drop your gun, hobbes.

## fuck you, huh?
you're making me do this.

## i don't know if i can do this.
jonesy?

## what the fuck you talking...?
say hobbes disappears into the woods....

## what's wrong with that?
if i kill you...... it's just the final...... pathetic chapter...... in the life of a disgraced hero.

## can you guess...... what maximum fun is?
sure you can.

## why is that?
because i need more time.

## time for what, asshole?
five hundred cubits.

## you think you're going to win?
god willing.

## why do you think...... milano...... came all the way out here...... in the middle of nowhere?
to die, the little chickenshit.

## pull what off?
oh, come on, azazel.

## what is this?
you don't smoke anymore.

## you know why?
because cigarettes kill.

## isn't it so sweet?
we die together...... just you and me.

## so what?

slump.

## hey, why don't you stick around for a bit?
the arctic challenge is in two weeks.

## lookie here.

## you're james johnson?

## or how about papa?
or maybe even daddy o.

## i don't belong here?
i'll show him.

## is everything all right?
everything's fine.

## are you sure?
oh, that's cold.

## you know what your problem is?
see, demon's got it in his head that he's the alpha dog.

## are you kidding?
i'm the only man ever to win the arctic flame three years running.

## were you being coy, or is that some sick alaskan mind game?
i'm sorry.

## mr. thunder?
look, maybe we started off on the wrong foot.

## excuse me?
i can go to $400, but that's it.

## danish, right?
oh, yeah.

## loco?
so... show me how to run them.

## sure... can't you see the resemblance?
oh, yeah.

## stop it.
you want a piece of me?

## hey, how are you going to pull if you're this way?
you got to look that...

## can you hold that?
yeah.

## what do we do with this guy?
girl.

## what is it with you people?
i'm cool.

## you cool?
sorry, nana but, uh... big doggies only.

## nice day for a drive, huh, nana?
eat your heart out.

## what got into her?
good eating.

## why didn't you just tell them to stop?
don't talk to me like i'm four.

## why do they got to make things so complicated?
man, you really stink.

## what's that?
don't worry, mountain man.

## what are you doing here?
i thought it'd be nice to walk the hill.

## how did you know about it?
i found lucy's diary.

## you know what else they don't have in this town?
crime, traffic, buses to put your face on.

## my mom?
she's amazing.

## so... how did you sleep?
that's beautiful.

## mama?
it's your favorite.

## can i have one... of those blue cheese cookies, please?
yeah.

## where am i?
my, my, my.

## where are lucy's dogs?
i was mushing.

## ted.
don't you know that?

## what?
i'll make you a deal.

## i tell you what i know, i get the dogs?
yeah.

## and i should've, you know, bunked down but i kept going thinking i could sneak up a couple of spots, you know?
that's when it turned ugly.

## now, i'd met her a couple of times in town but we weren't what you'd call friends, you know?
but cold weather brings people together in a strange way.

## that's it?
afraid so.

## will you look at that?
now, demon, look at me.

## so, what do you say we just give them something to remember us by, huh?
ah, that's my boy.

## teddy?
ooh, my lord, it's freezing in here.

## you see that dog out front?
that's the lead dog.

## why am i a dentist?
you always wanted to be a dentist.

## who's this?

## who?
this white man with her and the baby.

## hello?
yes, i need your next flight to alaska.

## how they look?
feet look good.

## old demon never changes, huh, jack?
been kind of ornery ever since victoria passed.

## what kind of a man eats before he feeds his dogs?
don't worry, they already docked him 20 minutes for that one.

## ted?
wait.

## what?
jack's missing.

## what?
hey, check out ted.

## what are you going to do next?
i'm going to disneyland, paris.

## so, what did he tell you about me?
he says you make amazing cookies.

## two minute break.
where is he?

## sure, you can dig, but you can't pull?
but wait a minute.

## aren't you supposed to send a search party or a posse or something?
look, ma'am... we're sorry, but there's simply no way to go through the pass.

## did you say your son is out there?
to the men and women of the arctic challenge the arctic flame is a symbol of hope.

## jack?
easy, demon, easy.

## jack?
okay.

## what are you doing here?
your leg's broke.

## well, how'd you get here?

## not bad for a greenhorn, huh?

## so, what kind of crazy stunt were you trying to pull out there?
oh, i thought i could win if i rode off into that storm.

## what...?
it's the latest in personal climate control.

## did she love you?
well, she said so once.

## mrs. brooks... why don't you come inside?
they'll sound off the siren when one of them comes in.

## well, what's wrong with him?
he's, uh, gnawing at his harness won't eat.

## gnawing at his harness, huh?
yeah.

## okay?
my, my, my.

## what do you want to do?
i have never not finished a race.

## are you barb?

we have a lock box at the bank for deeds and wills.

another lock box.

## which bank?
riggs bank.

## and you knew nothing about this other...... box?
not until saturday morning.

## are you saying curtis was killed...... because he knew something about these assassinations?
that's exactly what i'm saying.

## do you think there may be papers in the safe deposit box...... that may reveal what curtis knew about the assassinations?
there could be.

## where are the safe deposit boxes?
down those steps.

## the number, please?
616.

## i assume you're mrs. morgan?
sara ann morgan.

## the address?
225 willow road, bethesda.

## have you heard from grantham?
not since yesterday.

## what story?
see what you can find.

## what the hell is going on?
we're doing a story about victor mattiece...... and his involvement in the deaths of rosenberg and jensen.

## have you heard of the pelican brief?
we have a copy of it.

## you deny you wrote the memo?
i have.

## any comments?
i think we'll have great success with these people.

## what's up?
you know gray grantham.

## did the white house interfere in the fbl investigation of mattiece?
i'll discuss it...... off the record.

## so what do you do now?
there'll be a grand jury by noon tomorrow.

## who killed the man disguised as verheek?
oh, you mean the assassin, khamel.

## rupert?
he probably has 20 names.

## why was he following her?
i think the brief initially scared giminski more than anyone.

## what do you want?
to leave the country, alone.

## who is darby shaw?
that's a question for darby shaw.

## speaking for many of our colleagues...... who are in a feeding frenzy to interview her...... where is darby shaw?
that's also a question for darby shaw.

## does that mean you don't know where she is?
quite a few.

## what do they say?
the usual.

## may i help you?
i'd like to order room service.

## what would you like?
coffee...... scrambled eggs, whole wheat toast and orange juice, please.

## now, what was his claim?
that it violates the right of privacy.

## why?
he's got the right to do as he pleases in his home.

## but what if he decided to sell drugs at his home or engage in child abuse?
those actions don't fit within the right of privacy.

## but is that a constitutional claim?
there's no...... right to define oneself written into the constitution.

## why?
they're wrong.

## why?
sexual attraction.

## what you're saying...... is that if you could clone three of him, you'd all be happy.
you mean he's just got it?

## okay, tell us, what is your secret?
i'm not sure i can say on tv.

## a coat and tie may seem a bit rehearsed.
ladies, have you changed your opinion about our stud?

## you want me to talk to the nation in a time of crisis wearing a sweater?
mr. president...

## mr. voyles, does the fbi have any suspects?
it's too soon.

## are these killings in any way linked to the cla...... or to any other agency of the united states government?
i'm shocked you'd think that.

## bob, just look into it, okay?
i suggest we meet back here at five.

## but why kill him now, when he had so little time left?
maybe they couldn't take a chance he'd last till the elections.

## so why jensen?
this president nominated him.

## we're talking a conspiracy, then who are the conspirators?
if we've let foreign terrorists in, there'll be hell to pay politically.

## denton...... who are your suspects?
this has to be kept very quiet.

## correct?
watch your claws.

## did he say anything that might shed some light on these dreadful events?
yes.

## where've you been?
the library.

## so they might have been assassinated by an insatiable tax collector?
as yet, i rule no one out.

## can i help you?
i'd like to see this file, please.

## it's public record, isn't it?
semi public.

## are you familiar with the freedom of lnformation act?
this file has the pleading...... and correspondence.

## when was the trial?
last summer.

## where's the appeal?
not perfected yet.

## you have some obscure suspect unknown to the fbi and the cla and...... secret service and 1 0, 000 police departments?
i had one...... which i have now discarded.

## you skipped class, ignored me for a week, just to throw it away?
let me see it.

## hubris of the young, huh?
don't knock the hubris that i love.

## want to come out with me for a burger?
it might do you good to get out.

## you sure?
hey, sarge.

## which one?
not coal, the real one.

## would you believe he's all tore up about rosenberg?
and all fired up about...... restructuring the court.

## what'd you get me?
there's a short list of nominees.

## what about the investigation?
i haven't heard much...... but i'll keep my ears open.

## how old is she, this time?
twenty four.

## do you have a photo?
no, i don't.

## who killed them, gavin?
i'm just a lawyer with the bureau, i'm not an agent.

## your girlfriend has a theory?
here, take a look at it.

## is this gray grantham?
yes, it is.

## what kind of office?
i'm an attorney.

## private or government?
i'd rather not say.

## can this call be traced?
i'm not recording it or tracing it.

## what's your name?
garcia.

## do you have a copy?
i need to think about this.

## but could you live with yourself if you don't reveal what you know?
i'll get back to you.

## anything else?
maybe a small new wrinkle.

## what's the wrinkle?
it's a theory that surfaced in the last 24 hours.

## how's that?
it's all there in the brief.

## it's amateur stuff...... but how often does something make coal sweat and run for cover?
he didn't exactly sweat in front of us.

## did he have any symptoms?
as i told you, the president is here for his annual checkup.

## why didn't i think of that?
he hasn't decided whether to run again.

## do you really expect me to answer that?
one rumor i can deny is that he checked in to get away from you.

## although could you blame him?
thank you again.

## now, what's so important?
this is...... a brief...... written by an eager beaver law student.

## what are there, names?
one name.

## someone we both know?
i've decided my agenda for the future.

## what about the book on rosenberg?
you should write it.

## can i have the keys?

## how serious is this pelican thing?
i've assigned 1 4 agents in new orleans.

i'll pay with cash.

## what did voyles say?
mr. voyles has been unavailable.

## where will you stay?
at the westin, by the river.

we thought it was just another shot in the dark.

## what's up with grantham?
we got his car phone.

## why not?
we almost got caught by the cleaning lady.

## what made you hone in on this particular case so quickly?
... about the young lawyer who originally filed the suit.

## look, you've gone 26 days?
mm hmm.

## i don't want me to see me like this... but if there's one place i'm safe it's at home, right?
mmm.

## right?
from thy bounty, through christ, our lord.

## so, dad, when your hip heals, will it be like normal?
yeah, pretty much.

## really?
oh, they don't want to hear about that.

## isn't sex a god given natural part of life?
don't start, dad.

## why not talk about it?
i think a good sexual appetite... is a real, normal, healthy part of being a man.

## who wants more beans?
i do.

## walter, how could you forget the maui hilton?
in the shower.

## what the hell is that thing?
it's a special light that allows me to see... if any fluids have been liberated.

## is he twisting her nipple?
jeez, that's an oversight.

## huh?
i mean, not only is my wife not begging for it... she's not...

## did you see it's the warmest day of the year?
yeah, it's spring.

## what am i supposed to do now, vow boy, huh?
fix this.

## what are you doing?
i'm tired of waiting for things to happen.

## so what the fuck is that?
this is what the american medical association... refers to as... viagra.

## what's that?
oh, god, that's that new girl in tech support.

## god, that's one of the best relationships i have.
did you know that regular ejaculation... is a preventative against prostate cancer?

## why do you think they call it the little head?
i'll tell you why.

## what?
hey, jerry.

## do you need this?
no.

## are you ok?
mm hmm.

## that's a lot of money, isn't it?
it's your vow.

## she's something, isn't she?
aah.

## jerry?
uh, jerry's not here right now.

## what about the vow, jerry?
i tried.

## what?
all right.

## where is matt?
um...

## what are those, like some kind of a bribe?
more like... gentle persuasion.

## is this going to get worse before it gets better?
probably, but i got to get this out... before i lose my train of thought.

## you do?
it's very easy to confuse a physical attraction... with a real connection.

## how do you know about me?
i don't.

## is this against the rules?
mmm.

## matt, what are you doing?
the willow and smart people are here.

## want some camomile tea?
i think little mattie is trying to say hello.

## like, a vibrating flower?
no.

## he didn't even try to touch you?
no, and i so wanted him to... but what we were doing was so perfect.

## what are you doing here, nicole?
i just... needed to talk to someone.

## where's david?
i don't know.

## working late?
we broke it off.

## emily?
her name's erica.

## not even just a little?
let me put it this way.

## maybe you should go, hmm?
mmm, i think your little friend here wants me to stay.

## you're saying no to me?
you always do this to me... and i'm the idiot because i keep coming back... but i'm not coming back anymore.

## oh, yeah?
name me one thing that you ever gave me.

## where have you been?
the dude was in the john with a dirty mag.

## who does this matt guy think he is, anyways?
he's jerking us around.

## how do we know this is real?
if you just go to big window, look at the dude's face.

## merj, how many times have i been wrong?
pfft.

## why don't you quit wasting my time over here?
hey, bagel guy.

## well, that's great, isn't it?
no, that's not great.

## are you chris?
no, but i can be.

## can you deal with this?
yeah, sure.

## the stroke of midnight?
thanks, buddy.

## so, you'll take it?
sure.

## this is my fault?
no, it's mine.

## what?
it's just a sabbatical.

## so, you can't help me?
you're on your own, little man.

## since when do you smoke, matt?
since today.

## is this him?
yep.

## can i borrow your handcuffs?
if my hand is free, i'm bound to do anything with it.

## how much did you drink, matt?
god's spirit made jesus go to the desert.

## so, what about your late night visitor?
leave the front door open a little bit... and put that key right there.

## it is, isn't it?
you are going to be great.

## doesn't that feel better?
ohh.

## why would you do this?
well, this all started because of me.

## it only seems natural that i should end it, huh?
oh, here's your key.

## are you expecting someone?
oh, fuck.

## was it worth it?
oh, come on, erica, please.

## no?
i'll tell her something less idiotic, obviously, but...

## so?
i don't want to hear about it.

## but now you're on his side?
i've been here every day this week.

## remember when you said that you could never tell... about someone until you kiss them?
well...

## are you done talking now?
thirty eight hours exactly.

## anybody else want in on hour 39?
hey, hey.

## how do we even know that they're still even in there?
they could've put the cd player on repeat or shuffle.

## you know what?
look at me.

## what's up, matt?
hey, matt.

## you know what?
come on, come on.

## how long are you going to be in there?

yes.

## like what?
like what his name is.

## just tell me, are you being careful?
careful as mice.

## yes?
mrs ness, i think your husband just became the man who got al capone.

## i got it.
what's the maximum he could get?

## you enjoy the tactical aspects of law enforcement, oscar?
much more diverting than accounting.

## we made a deal, we're gonna stick to it, okay?
oh, yes, much more diverting than accounting.

## what was it, a boy or a girl?
john.

## john?
yeah.

## so she's okay?
yeah, she's okay.

## didn't you see him?
he just went down in the service elevator.

## did he say the service elevator?
yes.

it's always a crime when a young guy goes down in the line, jimmy.

## you know what i mean?
al capone.

## something you want here?
my friend was killed today.

## what?
easy.

## believe me, i understand.
you talk to me like that in front of my son?

## well, what's happened?
he says he can't be unprotected.

## what is it that the guy says?
he says he won't make a fool out of himself, and he won't go into court without a witness.

## hello?
hello.

## how is everything there?
no, you do it however you want.

## i'm sorry?
you heard me.

## my question is, are we done?
yes, i think we're done.

## so we sat in at a game that was above our head?
it appears so.

i have taken this as far as it can go.

## what did your wife want?
she wanted to know if i was...

## my wife?
yeah.

## it's nice being married, eh?
yes.

## wait a minute, stall him with what?

## walter?
al says we got to get out of town until he can fix this subpoena thing.

## i do now, don't i?
this is a place for cops.

## where the hell are we going, for a swim?
get out of the rain, you fool.

## i need to find that bookkeeper.
one more?

## are you crazy?
you're crazy.

## i'm gonna turn you over!
what do you think he's gonna do?

## is it?
you're dead.

## who the hell do ya think ya are?
let's cut the woofing, pal.

## on what basis?
somebody messes with me, i'm gonna mess with him.

## you understand?
now, i have done nothing to hurt these people.

doctor up some income tax, for which they got no case, to annoy me.

## to speak to me like men?

brings a knife to a gun fight.

## what?
bookkeeper.

## i said hold it!

## see?
yeah, i got him.

## excuse me?
i said that is correct.

## and you will decipher these coded entries for us?
i will.

## you were in charge of disbursements for mr capone?
yes, i was.

## and you personally distributed monies...... vast, undeclared monies...... to mr capone?
yes, i did.

## would you tell us the amounts?
in a three year period i personally disbursed monies to mr capone in excess of one and a third million dollars.

## would you repeat that amount, please?
one and a third million dollars.

## what does capone have?
we're nailing the lid on his coffin, and he's smiling.

## could we speak to you a minute, please?

what do i look like to you?

## are you gonna go after the organisation?
excuse me.

## is this justice?
never stop fighting till the fight is done.

## what did you say?
i said, never stop fighting till the fight is done.

## what?
you heard me, capone.

## what will you do then?
i think i'll have a drink.

## your finger?
gold.

## what did you do?
i followed that fish upriver and downriver.

## did i want to deprive my son the chance...... to catch a fish like this of his own?
this ladyfish and i....

## oh, darling, darling, it's still your night.... why did it strike so quick on gold when nothing else would attract it?
that was the lesson i learned that day...... the day my son was born.

## what, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?
i'm a footnote in that story, dad...... the context for your great adventure, which never happened, incidentally.

## how can you not understand that?
i'm sorry to embarrass you.

## and what does dr. bennett say?
no, sure, i'll talk to him.

## it's bad?
yeah, it's more than they thought.

## now, which one's it gonna be?
the one about the witch.

## ls it true she got a glass eye?
i heard she got it from gypsies.

## what's a gypsy?
your momma's a gypsy.

## or are you too scared?
i'll go in right now and get that eye.

## you get the eye?
i brought it.

## but it could kind of help you, couldn't it?
because, everything else, you'd know you could survive.

## ls that dr. bennett's car?
yes.

## and how is he?
well no, i got it.

## how much time does he have left?
you don't talk about that.

## you want some water?
you are in for a surprise.

## am l?
having a kid changes everything.

## did you do any of that?
no.

## you think i'm up for it?
you learned from the best.

## really?
truly.

## the old lady by the swamp?
she was a witch.

## so how does it happen?
surprise ending.

## you know where the chemicals are?
i did it when you were gone.

## did you have the chickenpox?
i wish.

## now, has someone tried talking to him?
you can't reason with him.

## all the same, i preferred to keep my bones unbroken.
hello?

## why are you here?
so you can eat me.

## did you ever think that maybe you're not too big...... but maybe this town is just too small?
i've heard in real cities there are buildings so tall...... you can't even see the tops of them.

## really?
oh, i wouldn't lie to you.

## now, you can eat a lot, can't you?
i can.

## so why are you wasting your time in a small town?
you're a big man.

## what's your name, giant?
karl.

## i mean, you think this town is too small for you?
well, it's too small for a man of my ambition.

## join me?
okay.

## what'd she say?
beats me.

## you know anyone who's taken it?
that poet, norther winslow, did.

## you're just trying to run away, aren't you?
edward bloom.

## you were expecting me?
not yet.

## what is this place?
last person we had from ashton was norther winslow.

## whatever happened to him?
he's still here.

## really?
there's a lot of expectation.

## may l?
it's only three lines long.

## what did she look like?
well, she was....

## was she naked?
yes, she was.

## how old are you?
eighteen.

## we all do.
sure is a lot now, though, huh?

## what?
i said, you're quite a catch.

## why?
this town is more than any man could ask for.

## how are you gonna make it without your shoes?
well, i suspect it will hurt.

## what happened to your shoes?
they kind of got ahead of me.

## really?
that's just wonderful.

## really?
you're lucky to get four words out of them in english.

## why not religion, dad?
it's rude to talk about religion.

## how are you feeling?
oh, i was dreaming.

## what were you dreaming about?
oh, i don't usually remember...... unless they're especially portentous.

## do you know what that word means?
it means when you dream about something that's gonna happen.

## can i take your picture?
oh, you don't need a picture.

## please?
all right.

## will never told you?
probably just as well.

## what's your name?
it's karl.

## what's the matter?
i haven't seen a customer so depressed...... since the elephant sat on that farmer's wife.

## see?
the big guy likes it.

## friends of the family.
real pretty?

## where does she live?
forget it.

## what?
you don't even know me.

## mr. calloway, sir?

## mr. calloway?
no.

## didn't kill anything, did l?
a few rabbits.

## how did you get so many?
i called everywhere in five states.

## bloom?
don.

## what the hell are you doing?
this is my girl.

## are you too scared to fight back?
i promised i wouldn't.

## you mean, you love this guy?
he's almost a stranger, and i prefer him to you.

## is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?
i'm not going to hurt you.

## what makes you think we'll help you?
over the next hour, i described my love for sandra k. templeton...... and the ordeal that brought me before them.

## and what are we supposed to do when we get to america?
i can get you bookings.

## ready?
and so the twins and i began our arduous journey...... halfway around the world.

## what about the details?
how they fell in love.

## what?
what, i know better...... than to argue romance with a french woman.

## do you love your father?
everyone loves my father.

## do you love him?
you have to understand.

## well, what's true?
he's never told me a single true thing.

## did i ever tell you about?
yes.

## the maple tree and the buick?
we've heard it.

## you see dad?
son.

## can we talk?
i think i'll get started on these dishes.

## do l?
i'm trying to make a metaphor here.

## it would kill me if he went through his whole life...... never understanding me.
oh, you're only seeing down to my nose?

## who do you want me to be?
just yourself.

## what is it?
it was during the war.

## oh, that really happened?
not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.

## i'm happy for you.
edward?

## what are you doing now?
i'm robbing this place.

## what?

## the whole vault?
i'm afraid so.

## are you jennifer hill?

we can go again next week.

## do i have to give it back to my mom?
well, i won't tell her if you won't.

## how did you know my father?
well, this was on his sales route...... so he was through here all the time, and everyone in town knew him.

## were you having an affair?
wow.

## if you found this deed, why didn't you just ask eddie?
because he's dying.

## how do you know?
no one would come out here unless they had business.

## you'll own the house, but it'll still be mine?
i'll be here, and you'll come and go as you please to one place or another.

## do i have that right?
in so many words, yes.

## instead of buying a convertible, you buy a town?
helping people makes me happy.

## have i offended you?
no.

## did you get married?
i was 1 8.

## what happened?
your father had a stroke.

i don't suppose that i could...... stay here with him.

## the river?
tell me how it happens.

## how what happens?
how i go.

## you mean what you saw in the eye?
i don't know that story, dad.

## dad?
you're different.

## what are you doing?
we pass dr. bennett, who tries to slow us down.

## where are we going?
the river.

## mom?
the lord is my shepherd, i shall not be in want.

## have you ever heard a joke so many times you've forgotten why it's funny?
pretty much.

## see?

## how did you get so many?
i called everywhere in five states.

## are you too scared to fight back?
i promised i wouldn't.

he's almost a stranger, and i prefer him to you.

## is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?
i'm not going to hurt you.

## what makes you think we'll help you?
over the next hour, i described my love for sandra k. templeton...... and the ordeal that brought me before them.

i can get you bookings.

## ready?
and so the twins and i began our arduous journey...... halfway around the world.

everyone loves my father.

## do you love him?
you have to understand.

## well, what's true?
he's never told me a single true thing.

## did i ever tell you about?

## the maple tree and the buick?
we've heard it.

## you see dad?
son.

oh, you're only seeing down to my nose?

## who do you want me to be?
just yourself.

## what is it?
it was during the war.

## oh, that really happened?

well, this was on his sales route...... so he was through here all the time, and everyone in town knew him.

## were you having an affair?
wow.

## if you found this deed, why didn't you just ask eddie?
because he's dying.

## how do you know?
no one would come out here unless they had business.

## you'll own the house, but it'll still be mine?
i'll be here, and you'll come and go as you please to one place or another.

## do i have that right?
in so many words, yes.

## instead of buying a convertible, you buy a town?
helping people makes me happy.

no.

we pass dr. bennett, who tries to slow us down.

## where are we going?
the river.

## mom?
the lord is my shepherd, i shall not be in want.

## have you ever heard a joke so many times you've forgotten why it's funny?
pretty much.

## see?

## what do you want?
drop him.

a monkey's uncle.

## so, your father showed you the whole kingdom, did he?
everything.

## he didn't show you what's beyond that rise at the northern border...?
well, no... he said i can't go there.

## why not?
simba, simba ; i'm only looking out for the well being of my favorite nephew.

it better not be anyplace dumb.

## mom, can i go with simba?
hmm...

## what do you think, sarabi?

## what have we got here?
hmm.

## what do you think, ed?

## you know about that?
simba, everybody knows about that.

## really?
oh, yes.

## oh, and just between us, you might want to work on that little roar of yours, hmm?
oh, okay...

## will i like the surprise?

hmm...

## what is it?
it's like you're back from the dead.

## isn't this a great place?
it is beautiful...

## why didn't you come back to pride rock?
well, i just... needed to get out on my own.

## what?
everything's destroyed.

## why?
you wouldn't understand.

## what wouldn't i understand?
no, no, no.

## what?
because it's your responsibility.

## don't you understand?
you're our only hope.

## what's happened to you?
you're not the simba i remember.

## now are you satisfied?
you don't even know what i've been through.

## what would it prove, anyway?
it won't change anything.

## come on, will you cut it out?
can't cut it out.

## the question is:whooo... are you?
correction i know your father.

## father?
simba, you have forgotten me.

## how could i?
you have forgotten who you are, and so have forgotten me.

## how can i go back?
i'm not who i used to be.

## very peculiar.
what was that?

## don't you think?
i thought he was with you.

## simba's gone to challenge scar.
where is he?

## who?
scar.

## who's got a scar?
no, no, no.

## it's awful, isn't it?
i didn't want to believe you.

## what made you come back?
i finally got some sense knocked into me.

## if i don't fight for it, who will?
i will.

## danger?
i laugh in the face of danger.

## what are you doing here?
at your service, my liege.

## we're going to fight your uncle... for this?
yes, timon ; this is my home.

## so what's your plan for getting past those guys?
live bait.

## where is your hunting party?
no you're dead.

## mufasa?
no ; it's me.

## how can that be?
it doesn't matter.

## oh, oh, ye well, i would, heh, naturally, heh however, there is one little problem.
simba?

## you see them?
they think i'm king.

## oh, must it all end in violence?
i'd hate to be responsible for the death of a family member.

## wouldn't you agree, simba?
that's not gonna work, scar.

## simba, what is he talking about?
ahh, so you haven't told them your little secret.

## do you deny it?
no.

## pleeease don't eat me.
truth?

## are you talking to me?
uh oh.

## are you talklng to me?!?
everything you ever told me was a lie.

## you wouldn't kill your old uncle...?
no, scar.

## how can i, ah, prove myself to you?
tell me, i mean, anything.

## yeah, that's what i heard.
frie he hends?

## ed?
no.

## timon, what are you doing?
i'm fast forwarding to the part where we come in.

## then why don't we tell them our story?
hey, i've got an idea.

## why don't we tell them our story?
i like the sound of that.

## because what they don't know is how we really were there... even though they didn't know we were there, you know?
couldn't have said it better myself.

## so, does this mean we're going back to the beginning?
oh, no, pumbaa, no.

## pumbaa, how can a rock be proud?
it's a rock.

## and what about us meerkats?
yeah, pumbaa, but it ain't pretty.

## excuse me.
what was that, what was what?

## uncle max?
uncle max, relax.

## have you seen timon?
no, i haven't, and what a day it's been.

## who else could break a hole?
four in one week... a new record.

## what?
it's called a skylight.

## isn't that creative?
a skylight.

## what's the point?
all we do is dig... so we can hide, and hide so we can dig.

## what's so bad about dreaming of a better home?
i want to show you something.

## what can i say?
it's nature's design.

## but when they die, they become the grass... and we eat the grass, right?
not exactly.

## alright, who's on sentry duty?
that's it... my son on sentry duty.

## why don't you save the hyenas the trouble... and kill me now?
just kill me now.

## isn't that what you want?
or maybe you would rather have him... go back on the digging crew.

## now... what do we do if we see a hyena?
that's right, mister... because the world out there is fraught with danger.

## swifty?
what a relief.

## suede is the look for this fall.
where's uncle max?

## hey, what's going on?
pumbaa, you're sitting on the remote.

## it just never gets old, does it?
the classics never do, honey.

## besides me?
that depends on what you think.

## the better question is, where are you going?
someplace wonderful, mister, where...

## you didn't happen to catch... the song i sang a few minutes ago, did you?
i didn't have the pleasure.

## harpoon a tomato?
perfect.

## mind taking that stick of yours... and drawing me a map, bub?
to find it, you must look beyond what you see.

## what the heck is that supposed to mean?
ah, well.

## strange but wise monkey?
you know, first impressions are very important.

## then why were you stalking me?
well, gee, i saw you go by... and i figured a little fellow like you... shouldn't be out here all alone.

## hey, what about you?
you're all alone.

## you are all alone, aren't you?
yeah.

## even the hungry ones?
yeah.

## must be the gleam on those vicious tusks, huh?
strikes fear into their hearts.

## special power?
to get me to a little worry free haven... out by that big pointy rock.

## and you want me to come with you?
i'm your pig.

## you mean, like friends?
whoa, easy there, big fella.

## if you weren't going to eat me... what kind of a wacky, wild pig are you?
i'm an insectivore.

## how about you, big boy?
i prefer the ones with wings.

## right, timon?
oh, you got that right, pally.

## you really think i look fat?
pumbaa, pumbaa, pumbaa.

## what exactly did he say?
look beyond what you see.

## let's have a little look, shall we?
beyond what i see.

## who cares?
it's not important.

## look, sire, how they kneel before the royal son.
don't you know the shortest distance... between me and my dream home... is a straight line?

## and i don't gotta share it with anybody.
so, i guess that's your special power, huh?

## lonely?
we should go say hello.

## how do you know when you're there?
i'll tell you how i know.

## beyond what you...
after all... this is an elephant graveyard... this is an elephant graveyard... and who would ever come to an elephant graveyard?

## hey, how am i supposed to look beyond what i see beyond that?
sorry.

## shall we run for our lives?
technically, no.

## you mind if i pause it for a second?
sure, go ahead.

## were you just picking your nose?
no, i had an itch on the inside.

## timon, you ok?
i give up.

## what, you're all alone in this big empty world?
the truth is...

## timon, are you crying?
i'm fine.

## why'd we ever listen to that stupid monkey?
i think maybe you're giving up too soon, timon.

## remember that place i told you about?
i'm dying here.

## wahh ahh ahh... come again?
hey, timon, i got an idea.

## you just can't help yourself, can you?
i see.

## you used a metaphor on timon?
he takes things literally.

## nice to have a supportive family, isn't it?
well, here i go.

## this bowling for porcupines wasn't the best idea, huh?
yeah.

## what do you say, one more round?
oh, sure.

## oh, please, oh, please?
nah, pumbaa, i'm beat.

## why not?
one more run won't change our lives.

## ok, who's in charge of the freeze frames?
sorry.

## go where?
you know, go... bad.

## why didn't you say so?
come on, let's go.

## again?
we're going to get old walking across this thing.

## what have you got against the concept... of a good night's sleep, huh?
actually, i...

## why don't you sleep over here with us?
mi pumbaa, su pumbaa.

## had a little too much hakuna matata?
sonny boy, i invented hakuna matata.

## oh, yeah?
well, i perfected it.

## pumbaa, who holds the record... for the world's longest bug belch?
that would be simba.

## who's the champion at slug swallowing?
simba again.

## cricket crunching?
simba.

## grub gulping?
simba.

## maggot munching?
still simba.

## snail slurping?
nobody.

## you've been hanging around... with the monkey again, haven't you?
our simba is growing up.

## three pals and no worries.
is this the little boy i carried?

## what more could you want?
i'm bushed.

## nala?
how did you...

## like two soul mates joined across the years... by the bonds of true love?
sweet, innocent little pumbaa.

## can you feel the love tonight?
that's so romantic.

## the peace the evening brings?
well, that worked like a dream.

## can you feel the love tonight?
she's making those eyes.

## you never give up, do you?
we won.

## and that's a good thing?
he seems to be taking it kind of hard.

## what do you mean, he's gone?
it's just like the baboon said.

## you want me to go over it again?
yes, please, but be a dear... and just skip to the part about simba... not that your childhood wasn't fascinating.

## why is she toying with us?
this crazy chick is going to eat us.

## but, timon, it's not really hakuna matata without simba.
don't you get it?

## not hakuna matata?
that's crazy talk... crazy talk, i tell you.

## you're just going to walk away, give up on all this?
i was about to ask you the same thing.

## did you find hakuna matata?
well, yes, i did.

## why should i be miserable?
i don't know.

## would you mind?
thanks.

## what was with the running?
if you can call that running.

## let's just cut to the chase, shall we?
oh, sure.

## what are you doing here?
looking for you.

## what do we do?
well, i've got a plan.

## how can we help?
ma, uncle max, you're going to dig a trap.

## we're going to need... dare i say it?
tunnels... lots and lots of tunnels.

## and lure them into the trap?
nothing gets past you.

## hey, pumbaa.
you think?

## what do you call a hyena with half a brain?
beats me, timon.

## what?
gifted.

## now, ma?
need more time, honey.

## is it ready yet, ma?
not yet.

## shenzi marie predatora veldetta jacquelina hyena... would you do me the honour of becoming my bride?
i don't think so.

## what will the children look like?
that violates so many laws of nature.

## if not me, who?
i'm lonely.

## can i be your best man?
i say we skip the wedding... and go straight to the buffet.

## now?
sure, if you're ready.

## you've really come a long way, timon.
what are we going to do?

## did you find what you were looking for?
i found a place that was beyond my wildest dreams... but it still wasn't home.

## it's over already?
well, pumbaa, that's the thing about endings.

## can we watch it again?
pumbaa, we just saw it.

## hey, what are you guys doing?
you didn't tell me you were watching the movie.

## hey, you guys are watching the movie?
any story worth telling is worth telling twice.

## ok, buddy, you win.
who is this crowd?

## sure you don't mind?
hakuna matata.

## what do i want you to do about it?

## at lunchtime?

## look, what is going on, ford?

they're portals to another dimension.

## i don't suppose this portal has central heating, does it?
ah, this is the one.

yeah, it's a big biggie, ford.

## what if it rips us all into tiny little atomic particle thingies?
this is the right one.

## i'm a coming.
did you?

## so, this is how it's all going to end, is it?
me, alone on a dead planet, with a manically depressed robot.

## you sure you don't have the question, or a way to, you know, access it or something?
oh, shh, shh.

## gun?
that humma sent you for.

## why'd i do that?
okay.

## so it wasn't destroyed?

## so you... you made the earth?
not me alone, but i...

## ever heard of a place, i think it's called norway?
uh, uh, and you're right, i shouldn't be so upset because life goes on, you know, and i should just go on with it.

## say what?
that is brilliant.

## who cares?
i do.

## why so edgy, baby doll?
relax.

## you wanna know why i'm edgy?
argh.

## you've got no home, no family, and you're stuck with me, another in a long line of men who doesn't really get you.
huh?

## huh?
that's not true.

## good, eh?
earthman, you must realize that the planet you lived on was commissioned, paid for and run by mice.

## when you say mice, do you mean the little furry white creatures with whiskers, ears, cheese?
yeah, but they're protrusions into our dimension of hyperintelligent beings.

## and are you?
uh... no.

## is this...?
first, our hosts attacked us.

## uh, is there anything else?
no, we're quite happy, thank you.

## sorry, did you just say you need my brain?

## what's all the fuss about?
vogons are the worst marksmen in the galaxy.

## how do you drive this thing?
we need that gun.

## you all right?
yeah.

## you got to ask yourself, what's the point?
no, as is.

## where did you have in mind?
i know this great restaurant at the end of the universe.

## how far's that?
about 1 2 minutes away.

## huh?
barman, six pints of bitter and quickly.

## at lunchtime?
sorry.

## look, what is going on, ford?
arthur...

## hi.

i assumed you were drunk.

## who's he?
she.

## oh, no.
who are you?

## oh, the costume?
right.

## really?
yes.

## maybe i'm de evolving.
what?

## well, i should tell you that i do not date single celled organisms, okay?
let's go somewhere.

## um, where do you have in mind?
madagascar.

## is that that new club on dean street?
no, it's a country off the coast of africa.

## why are we waiting here?
wait a sec.

## why not?
because, i just, you know...

## you're serious?
yeah.

## i want to go somewhere i've never been and i'd like to go with you, so...... what do you say, dr livingstone?
i say that's an extraordinary proposition.

## why don't you talk to me instead?
i'm from a different planet.

## what kind of chat up line is that?
mm, that does happen.

## you really think the world's going to end?
yes.

## shouldn't we lie down, or put a paper bag over our heads, or something?
if you like.

## will it help?
not at all.

## what are you doing?
it's already supplanted the encyclopedia galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom for two important reasons.

## good, huh?
i don't feel well.

## if i asked where we were, would i regret it?
we're safe for now.

## couldn't you have done something?
i saved your life.

## huh?
now we'll get a signal.

## what is a vogon?
ask the guide.

## hmm?
put this in your ear.

## huh?
we have unwittingly picked up a couple of hitchhikers.

## what?
hitchhikers.

## hmm?
yes, yes, yes.

## we're going to die?
yeah, we're gonna die.

## what's this?
this is... nothing.

## would you like a hug?
no.

## ford?
y es.

## what d'you...?
i was just watching myself.

## why'd you pick up hitchhikers?
i didn't.

## what?
wh... wh...

## say what?
when we engaged the improbability drive...

## just that?
i won't enjoy it.

## life?
don't talk to me about life.

## where?
sector zz9 plural z alpha.

## ghastly, isn't it?
all the doors have been programmed to have a cheerful and sunny disposition.

## call that job satisfaction?
you can thank the sirius cybernetics corp. for building robots with g. p. p.

## what's g. p. p.?
genuine people personalities.

## hey, slim, are you wearing my underwear?
i'm a robot.

## what the hell are you doing here?
i just stuck out my thumb and here i am.

## have we?
hey, trillian.

## you went down on that little planet and didn't call me?
sorry, i didn't know.

## hi, tricia mcmillan, right?
i think he called you trillian.

## which of us got the right one?
i shortened it.

## how'd you get here?
i just stuck out my thumb.

## in your pajamas?
i was in a hurry.

## did you know i was here?
don't flatter yourself.

## you do know what happened?
enough small talk.

## we're on the run, remember?
excuse me, we're having a chat.

## you wanna fight?
okay.

## didn't see that one coming, did you?
popped right out of the box.

## that doesn't sound good.
stole what?

## are you okay?
a little help over here.

## hit me.
good zarquon, do i have to do everyhing?

## uh, computer?
hi, there.

## i am speaking to the kidnapper of the president?
she digs me.

## did they have proper hyperspace authorization?
no, commander.

## so are you along for the ride or am i just dropping you somewhere?
that depends.

## you okay?
yeah.

## ape man, earth dude, sorry, what's your name again?
arthur.

## no hard feelings, okay?
sorry to hear about your planet...

## hey, hey, zaphod, what's with the two head thing?
oh, yeah.

## oh, so you carved it up?
yes.

## so, two heads is what does it for a girl?
i mean, if i'd had two heads, or three...

## anything else he's got two of?
come on, arthur, don't be like that.

## bleeping?
i can fold my eyelids inside out if you like.

## do you see this?
this detects what you're craving and makes it for you.

## do you see this?
this toasts bread while you're slicing it.

## how badly does it hurt?
it doesn't feel great.

## the answer to what?
the answer to life, the universe, everyhing.

## is it finished?
no, there's more.

## seven and a half million years later?

but then, our life went the way of the trees when the ayatollahs ripped the soul out of our beautiful country.

## hello.
who knows what he does now?

## what time is it?
it's, um, 9:00.

## how's the program?
fine.

## one day at a time, right?
i just hope it's working.

## how's everyone there?
frankie's good.

## how's your better half?
fine.

## sleeping?
hmm.

## i'm gonna go, okay?
listen.

## the 18th?
yeah.

## again?
yeah.

## you're still not smoking, right?
yeah.

## why?
it should come as no surprise to you.

## are you out of your mind?
there's no smoking in my house.

## we gonna meet down there?
supposed to be a hot one today.

## do you want that?
look, you can't evict me.

## do you have a lawyer?
i can't afford a lawyer.

## may i help you?
my car is parked here.

## oh, oh, what happened to you?
i fell.

## again?
yeah.

## do you remember our bungalow on the caspian, how i ordered the trees cut down on the west side so we may view the sea?
please, be quiet.

## nadi?
i today have bought for us another bungalow.

## and what of esmail's university education?
soon we will have nothing.

## they evicted you from your house for that?
you got it.

## um, are you staying with friends?
yeah, i'm with a friend.

## how much is this gonna cost me?
it's on a sliding scale.

## um, how come you didn't do something about this earlier?
i did.

## and what about the follow up mail?
i didn't open it.

## when did you sign that letter?
i don't know.

## march?
well, i hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the county's already sold your house.

## what?
no.

## before the 18th, right?
it's possible.

## you all right?
yeah.

## you?
good.

## excuse me?
no.

## they already sold your house?
technically, it's mine and my brother's.

## you have any kids, mr. burdon?
two.

## do you mind if i give you some professional advice?
no.

## yeah?
your credit card didn't go through.

## is there any way we can let it slide until then?
the only affordable way to put a terrace up there is to put the stairs on the outside.

## but this window must be obstructed?
i don't see any other way.

## what the fuck are you doing?
this is my house.

## who are you?
this is my house.

## are you mrs. behrani?
no.

## could we use your bathroom?
she stepped on...

## could we use your washroom to clean her foot?
okay.

## have you had a tetanus shot lately?
i'm gonna be sick.

## is she bleeding?
excuse me.

## what happened?
i'll tell you what happened.

## you were there?
yeah, i was there.

## did you get their name?
ah...

## bahroony?
behmini, something like that.

## will you type a letter to the courier service and make sure that it gets to a mr. behrmini?
it's damn hard to sell a house nowadays.

## you tell the office, colonel?
no.

## is this you?
hmm.

## would you sell the county back the house?
they would make it as comfortable a transaction as possible.

## why should she wait to get back into her home that was wrongfully taken?
just because you want to turn a profit.

## good one or a bad one?
it's good.

## so, how's the el rancho?
i'm not there anymore.

## why is your husband no longer with you?
i wanted kids.

## do you remember the beauty of the caspian sea, esmail?
the water like glass.

## massoud, when must we move again?
not too soon.

## would you prefer that?
i will do as you wish.

## did i just lose you?
no.

## you sure?
yeah.

## where is your house?
in millbrae.

## what's your situation, les?
i married my best friend.

## what about her?
it's not the same for her.

## do you want to come inside?
massoud.

## what time is it?
it's 10:00. oh, god.

## it?
telling her the truth about how i feel.

## how do you feel?
i feel found.

## i can't legally get my house back?
it would've been a lot easier if you'd just opened your mail.

## when would the house be available?
not until autumn.

## why should i be penalized for their incompetence?
i told them the truth.

## what happened?
my lawyer couldn't get the house back.

## and he put his hand on you?
it's okay.

## who is this guy?
his name's behrani.

## what country is he from?
i don't know.

## what are you doing?
officers tend to listen to other officers.

## what if he doesn't listen?
then i'll make him listen.

## does it go down the hill?
it is an investment property, soraya.

## what are they celebrating, stealing a woman's house?
fuck these people.

## did you post that sign, sir?
yes.

## and that's your sign at the bottom of the hill?
yes.

## where is everybody?
my lord.

## how have you been?
i'm sorry, camilla, i hooked it.

## how is your tummy today?
it's okay.

## think you can eat some lunch for me?
i got some leftover chicken and biscuits.

## robert, are you all right?
yes, mama.

## can i play baseball with frank and perry now?
soon.

## and i wonder what it could be?
you got it.

## why did you tell camilla this is monkey year?
not monkey year, honey.

## what animal am l?
you, my dearest, are a tiger.

## what animal are you, mama?
i'm a dragon.

## can you breathe fire?
yes, i can.

## can any of them play?
not really.

## if they could, they wouldn't need you, would they?
they make their whiskey out of corn here.

## so, stewart, what do you think about my stance?
go on.

## wee bobby?
yeah.

## are you here by yourself?
yes, mr. jones, they are all yonder playing golf.

## won't you have a seat and wait?
let me get you a coca cola.

## tell me, mr. maiden, how did they decide... that there should be 18 holes in a round of golf?
ma'am, a long time ago at st. andrew's... they had a meeting to try and figure that out.

## setting a bad example for your son?
getting little bob outdoors... has done wonders for his health.

## and why?
because i play golf with asa kindler and bob woodruff.

## so you're telling me that it's not your merit as a lawyer... that's advancing your career?
i bet your poor mother's missing you.

## don't you think?
go on, now.

## what about me?
take two weeks off from the game.

## what are those?
20 cents apiece.

## did you get any of them while they were still rolling?
no, sir.

## aren't you children supposed to be in school?

## rob, why don't you show us all how stewart maiden hits the ball?
go ahead, son.

## little bob.

no, but i've been having a few.

## how do you do?
better than most, son.

## but you know what i've learned?
three bad shots and one good one still make par.

## school is nice, i guess... but isn't the point of it all to make a nice, big bag of money?

and i want to win.

## do you know why i play golf?
for the money.

## may i have a coca cola, please?
you surely may.

## what are they saying?
a lot of the folks are picking us to win... even though this herron fellow is a member here.

## what am i gonna say to him?
the way i see it, he's trying to please you, his mother... and the whole damn city of atlanta.

## where is he now?
he's making a telephone call.

## his mother?
i don't think so.

## that was bobby jones on the telephone?
he prefers bob.

## ls he winning?
somebody moved.

## are you mad?
it's all right.

## who's that?
i have no idea.

## do you play golf, mary?
no, i don't.

## you want to come by?
i'm with someone.

## what's your girlfriend's name?
we could call her marigold, because that's what she's trying to do.

## are you sure she's your type?
that's enough.

## what you drinking?
it looks like beer.

## bonny bobby, is it?
my name's angus.

## how do you do?
it's a dream come true... to play with you here at the open.

## really?

## mr. vardon, you ever seen a worse shot than that?
no.

## would you like to have dinner tonight?
i'm sorry.

## even the crows are walking.
why do you defy me... and allow in your son what i wouldn't allow in you?

## who made this course?
a glacier, 15, 000 years ago.

## the old course gave you a thrashing, did she?
that's her duty.

## ls it me, or does he look like he's limping?
i'm so sorry.

## you want me to read it again?
you will never play in another usga event...

## ls that what it takes?
come back here.

## robert, what's the matter?
my god.

## how long has it been like this?
weeks.

## will you take up golf professionally?
you should think about it.

## lsn't he, colonel?
that would be up to him.

## which one of you boys is gonna be second?
proceed, my good man.

## did you?
the betting is 10 to 7 on cruickshank.

## that's what they're saying?
this playoff... it means a fortune to cruickshank.

## what's it say?
keep the ball in the fairway...

## stewart, how you doing?
good, thanks.

## where's big bob at?
sorry to interrupt, sir, but it's major cohen of the atlanta journal.

## how long you been selling real estate?
just a couple of months now.

## when's your next tournament?
the us open, next month.

## who's better than us?
you better show me something today, kid.

## y'all didn't see it move?
no.

## are you sure you caused that ball to move?
i know i did.

## why do you think it was so lopsided a victory?
when walter had to putt... he made it every time.

## how do you feel being the most famous golfer in the world?
i don't think i am.

## what's your handicap coming into this season, sir walter?
same as last year.

## not a very promising year for bobby jones?
i'm here to eat my words, sports fans.

## can he do it?
here's my advice, sports fans..

## can i have your autograph, mr. jones?
just sign my shirt.

## he's, what, six strokes behind?
i'm going to play.

## yes, would you hold one moment, please?
my love for you has nothing to do with you winning any championships.

## hello?
hello, honey.

## honey?
that is terrible.

## then what did mr. grimes say to you?
he told me to go to hell.

## robert jones, what is on your mind?
because we know it ain't my cooking.

## ln six years, have we spent even one together?
well, if you're going to go... then go.

## you know how i feel?
this time it's gonna be different.

## do you think i'm worried about myself?
i know what these tournaments do to you...

## how many is enough, bob?
it's one of your favorites.

## what?
i can win all four majors.

## what do you think your chances are to win all four majors this year?
lloyds of london have the odds of 1 20 to 1 against it.

## can he win the impregnable quadrilateral?
yes, of course he can.

## do you know who i am?
yes, sir.

## how are we doing?
walter hagen shot a sixty eight.

## how's that swing?
i seem to remember you beat the living hell out of me.

## remember what the headlines said?
i think i tried to avoid the papers for a time.

## but you know... this is where it stops, don't you?
lf you pull off this grand slam thing... then i am nothing but a footnote.

## who's gonna be second, walter?
tell me something, fellows.

## why is it, whenever i fail to stop this amateur... the rest of you curl up and die, too?
all this damn part timer has to do is show up... and the best pros in the business drop dead.

## one of you better step up in the final round, you hear me?
go to hell, hagen.

## so, jones, when are you gonna cash in?
hagen's pitching that hair tonic, which is why you never see him wear a hat.

## they pay a man not to wear a hat, can you believe that?
hair tonic, shaving cream.

## so, what's holding up your parade, sport?
i'm an amateur, mr. mullen.

## do you know what the origin of that word is?
to be an amateur is to love the game.

## so, what are you, jones, some kind of idiot?
don't think i don't read your crap, keeler.

## colonel?
bob has got terrible stomach cramps.

## when do you turn pro?
pardon me.

## where is he?
congratulations, son.

## could i interest you in a marriage to a full time atlanta man?
i think you'll like this fellow.

## what are you gonna do for yourself?
we're standing on the first tee.

what is that monstrosity?

## hmm.
hmm?

## how much time do we have?
agent pleakley at your service.

## the mosquito's food of choice, primitive humanoid life forms have colonies all over that planet.
can we not simply destroy the island?

## are they intelligent?
no, but they're very delicate.

## it's fascinating, isn't it?
with this, i've been able to study...

## he got away?
i'm sure this comes as no surprise to you.

## me?
and to reward you we are willing to trade your freedom for his capture.

## who's going to control him?
you will.

## lilo, why are you all wet?
it's sandwich day.

## lilo, lilo, why is this so important?

## and you like me better as a sister than a rabbit, right?
oh...

## you hit her?
before i bit her.

## my camera's full again.
yeah?

## maybe send me an angel... the nicest angel you have.
aren't they beautiful?

## what we when hit?
there it is.

## we're looking for something that can defend itself... something that won't die... something sturdy, you know?
like a lobster.

## do we have a lobster door?
we have better dogs, dear.

## does it have to be this dog?
he's all yours.

## he's listening for us.
well, what's he doing?

## how good is his hearing?
i mean, can he...

## okay, i got to get to work.
why don't you run?

## stick around town and stay out of the roads, okay?
i'll meet you at 1:00.

## okay, i guess we should be going.
hmm?

## what do you want?
i'm sorry i bit you and pulled your hair and punched you in the face.

## you sure it's a dog?
nah, just the stage.

## maybe some other time, okay?
don't worry.

## is that your dog?
uh...

## yeah?

## huh?
o'hana means family.

## or...?

## push that over.
why not try and make something for a change?

## it keeps staring at me, like it's going to eat me.
what are you doing?

## are you there?
now, this is interesting.

## what?
6 2 6 was designed to be a monster but now he has nothing to destroy.

## that's the ugly duckling.
what must it be like to have nothing... not even memories to visit in the middle of the night?

## see?
he's sad because he's all alone and nobody wants him but on this page, his family hears him crying and they find him.

## want to listen to the king?
look.

## what is that thing?
that's my puppy.

## really?
thus far, you have been adrift in the sheltered harbor of my patience but i cannot ignore you beingjobless.

## do i make myself clear?
i am all about coffee.

## see?
now you try.

## howzit...

## nani?

## what happened?
lilo, look at me.

## are you hurt?
no.

## is there something i can do?

## i know you had something to do with this.
lilo?

## okay, okay.

former.

## tell me...... do you think about hell?
no, neither do i.

## how long have you been in south africa?
a week.

## just what are you doing in this car, coolie?
why, i have a ticket.

## how did you get it?
i sent for it in the post.

## you see?
mohandas k. gandhi, attorney at law.

## didn't you hear me?
there are no coloured attorneys in south africa.

## why put up with it?
yes, i am rich.

## you mean, you employ mr. baker as your attorney...... but you can't walk down the street with him?
i will write to the press...... here and in england.

## why should we not walk on the pavements like other men?
i rather like the idea of an indian barrister in south africa.

## now?
if you want this kind of trouble, you can have it.

## yes?
we're very pleased to have you back, papa.

## will you take this off?
it pinches every time i speak.

## you're a clergyman?
i met some remarkable people in india.

## does that surprise you?
not anymore.

## that's the kind of thing you'll be seeking on this farm?
well, we shall try.

## you see?
hindus, muslims...... sikhs, jews...... even christians.

## how you doing?
without a paper, a journal of some kind...... you cannot unite a community.

## you will respect the law?
there are unjust laws as there are unjust men.

## and you call it an ashram?
that's right.

## you'll need something before your journey back.
is that part of the experiment?

## would you excuse me, please?
yeah, sure.

## what is it?
you're human.

## have you been to prison?
let them march.

## i don't know who they've left out there to do the work.
how do we treat men who defy an unjust law...... who will not fight...... but will not comply?

## have they touched the women?
mr. gandhi.

## will you have a glass of sherry?
thank you, no.

## perhaps some tea?
i dined at the prison.

## how far will you be going, gandhi?
now that this is settled, i'd thought seriously of going back to india.

## what the devil's going on back there?
must be that indian who made all that fuss in africa.

## mr. gandhi, have you refused to wear european clothes?
no, i haven't refused.

## will you support the war effort?
if i wish to enjoy the benefits and protection of the british empire...... it would be wrong of me not to help in its defence.

## now that you're back in india, what will you do?
i don't know.
