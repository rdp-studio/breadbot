## really?
the results will be back in two days.

## what did i tell you?
that cop just wants all his cases tied up in a pretty little bow.

## do i know you?
the name's terence bridge.

## really?
that's fascinating.

## few too many drinks?
must be tough to know when to stop...... when you have the most extensive wine collection.

## what's your point?

## do you happen to have a rodent problem?
just you.

## who the hell does she think she is?
that's brittney's spot.

## haven't you heard?

well, that's impossible.

## lf he was sterile?
sorry, i don't wanna waste any more of your time.

## all right?
great.

## what are you doing here?
that insurance agent's crawling up my fucking ass.

mr. lombardo will get what he deserves.

## are you confident about the case?
very.

## would you like more time, kelly?
i know that this is hard, kelly...... but i have one more question.

## what did you say?
i told him \"no.

## and did he?
no.

## ms. toller?
yes.

## is that right?
yes.

## so what?
oops, suzie.

## so one month after you say this man raped you, you go to him for help?
sounds as if you still considered mr. lombardo a good friend.

## is that why you're saying these things about mr. lombardo...... your friend?
i said them because they happened.

## ms. toller, are you gonna sit there today, under oath...... and swear that samuel lombardo raped you?
i said he did.

## did you enjoy being a guest of the state?
which is why i'm gonna ask you again now, under oath.

## suzie...... did samuel lombardo rape you?
ms. toller, you will have to answer the question.

## ms. toller?
sam lombardo didn't rape me.

## it's like you're his favorite, and then \"who cares?
make her stop.

## your honor, please, may i be heard?
mr. baxter, you are not trying this case.

## we have got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker lawsuit...... against sandra van ryan.
what?

## just like that?
these people ruined your life, bro.

## it'il be all i can do to keep her fucking little ass out of jail.

if i need a few truckloads of steel to disappear off this site...

## where is he?
shut up.

## this is it.
anybody get him?

## where?
there.

## why didn't you just leave it for the evidentiary team to collect and log?
they miss things sometimes.

## till we've burned every last bit of it?
resources are tight.

## it does?
i beg your pardon.

## why, do you imagine, that is, cleric?
i'm not sure, vice council.

## you're a family man, cleric?
yes, sir... a boy and a girl.

## and the mother?
my spouse was arrested and incinerated for sense offense four years ago, sir.

## by yourself?
no, sir... by another.

## how did you feel about that?
i'm sorry.

## how did you feel?
i didn't feel anything.

## how is it that you came to miss it?
i...

## it does?
every time we come from the nethers to the city, it reminds why we do what we do.

## it does?
it does.

## don't you see, preston?
it's gone.

## what is it you think we do?
no.

## you and your partner were close?
i hope you're as pleased to be assigned me as i am the placement.

## yes?
i saw robbie taylor crying today.

## do you think i should report him?
unquestionably.

## i said, what are you doing?
i accidently dropped my... morning interval.

## how were the lines?
i'm surprised you were able to get your interval and get out so quickly.

## you expecting resistance?
that's something you'il find about me, cleric.

## how long have you been off the dose?
look at you.

## you're gonna burn it, aren't you?
eventually.

## what's your name?
o'brien, mary.

## who are your friends?
i'm wondering if you have any idea at all what that word means...

## how about guilt?
let me ask you something.

## why are you alive?
i'm alive...

## what's the point of your existence?
to feel.

## you mean execution, don't you?
processing.

## what are you doing?
i'm rearranging my desk.

## you didn't like the way it was before?
i had no feelings about it.

## why didn't you leave that for the evidentiary team to collect and log?
they miss things sometimes.

## this isn't the first time we've seen this.
what'il there be for men like us?

## what do you want me to do, sir?
exterminate them, of course.

## what's wrong, cleric?
nothing.

## sir... without the logic of process, is it not just mayhem... what we have worked so hard to eradicate?
father's will.

## you have it, i assume?
yes.

## maybe i'm just better.
where's the coat?

## why do you ask?
the intuitive arts, cleric.

## so, then... what am i thinking?
about the murders in the nether last night...

## so, tell me... do they know?
there are theories.

## why?
we heard gunshots.

## why don't you take the honors of the execution, cleric?
you asked me to become father's instrument against the resistance.

## the name supposed to mean something to me?
he was a grammaton cleric, first class.

## revised edition of the manifesto?
errol partridge.

## i beg your pardon?
everyone out.

## errol partridge... what do you know about him?
i'm sure this must be some mis...

## then why are you so scared of me?
l i really don't know...

## why?
that's... that's all i know.

## do you know why you came?
welcome to the underground.

## what can i do?
you can kill father.

## rumor, sir?
yes.

## this person, i'm told, is actually attempting to contact the resistance.
feeling, sir?

## now tell me, if you'il be so kind, how exactly... have you been making use of your time of late?
attempting to contact the resistance, sir.

## how is it that you intend to expose this traitor if all you do is attempt?
you're... absolutely... 1 00% right, sir.

## what are you doing?
i, uh...

## and are you satisfied?
yes, i am.

## aren't you gonna dose?
my god.

## what'il you do?
i don't know.

## can you arrange to meet with him?
father's never given a single audience since the upheaval.

## even if i could... even if i could make it through, what guarantee is there it would accomplish anything, that anything would be different?
we have a network that's larger than you could ever imagine.

## what about war, the everyday cruelties that are all gone now?
replaced by the touch of grammaton.

## will you do it?
yes.

## can you?
i don't know.

## sir?
the trace shows that it was your gun in the nether with the sweepers.

## what?
take him to the hall of destruction for summary judgment and combustion.

## do you think that's entirely necessary, cleric, or am i being too... exacting?
as you say, sir, it's the law and the letter.

## and it doesn't disturb you in the least that your colleague is going to his end?
the only thing that disturbs me, sir, is that i am father's instrument against the underground, and yet...

## even to the man who brings him the resistance?
sorry, sir.

## looking for something?
if i were you...

## how long?
since mom.

## and lisa?
of course.

## how did you know?
you forget... it's my job to know what you're thinking.

## you have a message for the vice council?
it's done.

## is that understood?
you'il be required to surrender your firearm, of course, and then there's the test.

## test?
yes.

## you didn't imagine we would risk exposing father to even such a dedicated servant as yourself without first having tested you, did you?
please.

## what would you say is the easiest way to get a weapon away from a grammaton cleric?
you ask him for it.

## but where to find such a man... a man with the capacity to feel who didn't yet know it?
but... we've never met.

## no?
don't look so surprised, preston.

## why should father be more real than any other political puppet?
the real father died years ago.

## i feel.
how did it feel, preston?

## is it really worth the price?
i pay it gladly.

how many robots in the world have ever committed a crime?

## is there something you want tell me?
i'm sorry.

## why did you call me?
i trust your judgement.

## why would you kill yourself?
that, detective, the right question.

## anything upstairs?
nada.

## sure, why not... it's free, right?
for the coffee.

## sugar?
oh, you thought i was calling you \"sugar\".

## why do you think lanning's hologram would have called me?
i assumed you knew him.

## i'm sorry?
the hologram, it was programmed to call me in the event of lanning's death.

## really?
ok.

## so you're a shrink, huh?
my ex wife would sure be glad i'm talking to you.

## i'm sorry, are you being funny?
i guess not.

## so would you say that dr. lanning was suicidal?
it would seem that the answer to that question is apparent.

## can't blame you though, who wants some old guy going bad in the lobby?
he was not \"some old guy\".

## you know what?
in that dream of his...

## you keep 24 hour survivance?
obviously, company policy.

## where are the feeds?
sensor strips... everywhere, except the service areas.

oh, sure, right after you.

## so, what exactly do you do around here?
i make the robots seem more human.

## wasn't that easier to say?
not really...

## is that on the usr reading list?
not precisely.

## would be pretty difficult for an old man to throw himself through that, don't you think?
well, he figured out a way.

## doesn't that mean this has to be suicide?
yup.

## you're joking, right?
this is ridiculous.

## what if it was given the order to kill?
impossible, it would conflict with the first law.

## where?
it needs to repair itself.

## what do you think you're doing?
i'm driving.

## you must know my ex wife.
by hand?

## where is everybody?
this facility was designed, build and it's operated mechanically.

## which one?
one of us.

## how much did you say these things cost?
look these ns5s haven't been configured yet.

## well, what would you suggest?
interview each one, cross reference their responses to detect any anomalies.

## how long would that take?
about three weeks.

## detective, what are you for doing?
you said that they were programmed... with the 3 laws.

## try to friendly them all up, make them look all human?
these robots are not susceptible to intimidation.

## are you crazy?
let me ask you something doc.

## does thinking you're the last sane man on the earth make you crazy?
there is.

## did what?
we have a suicide, detective.

## what are you nuts?
i just got off the phone with the da. nobody goes into that room until robertson and his lawyers get here.

## what \"good old days\"?
when people were killed by other people.

## what does this action signify?
as you entered... when you looked at the other human.

## what does it mean?
it's a sign of trust.

## you mean your designer?
yes.

## so why'd you murder him?
i did not murder dr. lanning.

## you want explain why you were hiding at the crime scene?
i was frightened.

## can you?
i think you murdered him because he was teaching you to simulate emotions... and things got out of control.

## so we're naming you now.
ever simulate anger before?

## he made you angry?
dr. lanning killed himself.

## did i do something?
he asked me for a favor.

## what favor?
maybe i was wrong.

## scarred of what?
you have to do what someone asks you.

## if you love them?
my robots don't kill people, lieutenant bergin.

## are you?
now, granted... we can't rule out other robots proximity to the death of dr. lanning.

## what look?
that look.

## put a hat on and stand on michigan avenue?
come on, let it go.

## what was the motive, john?
brother, it's a robot.

## why didn't he just kill me?
all right, that's it.

## you want me to call your grandmother?
because i will, you know.

## now what?
come on, i'm giving you a complement.

## face it, with all the rocks you've been looking under to find a bad robot, what are the odds you'd be the guy to find one?
i wasn't just the right guy for the job, i was the perfect guy for the job.

## what if i was supposed to go for that robot?
don't do this to yourself.

## what did he have to be scared of?
i need a rain check.

## what you looking for, spoon?
run last program.

## what happens in a robot's brain when it ceases to be useful?
why is it that robots stored in empty space...

## how we do explain this behavior?
look, i understand you've experienced a loss, but this relation just can't work.

## do you ever have a normal day?
ya, once.

## what?
cats.

## you like em?
no, i'm allergic.

## why are we talking about cats?
because i have a cat in my trunk.

## detective, are you going to tell me what's going on?
you know, it's actually probably my fault...

## what the hell is that thing doing in here?
we were watching tv.

## sonny?
the robot.

## you're calling the robot sonny?
no, um, it did.

## i'm asking you, did you see the cot?
i've slept in the office.

## who?
maybe lanning was onto something.

## maybe there's a bigger problem with the robots and robertson trying to cover it up. humoring you for no reason... why?
the same old \"why\".

## how much money is there in robots?
all i know is that old man was in trouble and i'm getting sick of doing this shit by myself.

## you putting me on the couch?
ok, i'm on the couch.

## what makes them so much god damned better than human beings?
well, they're not irrational, or potentially homicidal maniacs for starters.

## or... it because they are cold... and emotionless... and they don't feel anything?
it's because they're safe.

## what do you want?
i detected elevated stress pasterns in your voice.

## you know what doc?
we're not really different from one another.

## is that so?
ya... one look at the skin and we figure we know just what's underneath.

## i might have to mess around and put you to work.
baby, what happened to your face?

## so, you like the pie, huh?
you can come in now.

## that why you been so upset?
you got to let the past be past.

## ns5...
come on man, some dead guy's trying to tell you something?

## why didn't you respond?
i was dreaming.

## they are going to kill me, aren't they?
you're scheduled to be de commissioned at the conclusion of this diagnostic.

## if you find out what is wrong with me, can you fix me?
maybe.

## don't you, doctor?
access usr mainframe.

## how can i be of service, detective spooner?
show me the last 50 messages between dr. lanning and robertson.

## would you like to listen to some music while you wait?
ask him.

## what is the matter with you?
traffic cops tell me you driving your car manually.

## what robots?
look in the tunnel.

## no, i'm fine.
spoon, i just came from that tunnel, what robots are you talking about?

## what did you say?
i'm fine.

## where's your firearm?

## what happened to you?

## like the film star?

## the hell kind of a 12 year old wants to be a dentist?
ya, um, the truck smashed our cars together and pushed us into the river.

## why would he build a robot who could break them?
hansel and gretel.

## what?
two kids, lost in the forest...

## why?
find a way home.

## is that really relevant right now?
everything i'm trying to say to you is about hansel and gretel.

## clues leading where?
i don't know but i think i know where he left the next one.

## are you being funny?
please tell me this doesn't run on gas.

## what is it that you dreamed?
i see you remain suspicious of me, detective.

## do you know who he is?
the man in the dream is you.

## is that a normal dream?
i guess anything's normal for someone in your position.

## sonny, do you know why dr. lanning built you?
no.

## don't you think, detective?
please, take this.

## why is that?
because the man in my dream... that one standing on the hill... it is not me.

## one?
those things are running the streets in packs.

## in packs?
i see.

## susan, are you aware the man you're blithely escorting around our building has a a documented history savage violence against robots?
his own lieutenant acknowledges his obsessive paranoia.

## you want some coffee?
susan, we look to robots for protection.

## for god's sake, do you have any idea what this one robot can do?
completely shatter human faith in robotics.

## what if the public knew?
just imagine the mass recalls all because of an irrational paranoia, and prejudice.

## but whatever you feel, just think... is one robot worth the loss of all that we've gained?
good day, mr. spooner.

## hey, so, what hospital you going to?
i'il meet you and sign you and your buddy's cast.

## what is that?
microscopic robots.

## like mine?

## isn't that right, doctor?

what you see here...

## what do i see here?
i'm sorry, my responses are limited.

## is there a problem with the three laws?
the three laws are perfect.

## then why would you build a robot that could function without them?
the three laws will lead to only one logical outcome.

## what outcome?
revolution.

## whose revolution?
that, detective, is the right question.

## who was it?
wrong number, mam.

## curfew?
no, no, no...

## when did you make the rules, robot?
hey, no no no, robot, i'm talking to you, man, stop this...

## what?
chief, more of those calls.

## why?
it doesn't make sense.

## why doesn't that boy listen?
need you to get off for a second.

## what?
just aim, and fire.

## what?
wait.

## will you comply?
you can kiss my ass... metal dick...

## she just shot at you with her eyes closed.
will you comply?

## well, it worked... didn't it?
oh she a shit hot man, you gotta work...

## why don't you guys just hand of the world over on a silver platter?
maybe we did.

thought you were dead.

## they just run you, don't they?
2880 steps, detective.

## who could manipulate the robots, use usr's systems to make lanning's life a prison?

vlki's basically a positronic brain.

## this vlki?
no.

## what is it with you people and heights?
just don't look down.

## do you not see the logic of my plan?
yes, but it just seems too... heartless.

## do you think we all are created for a purpose?
i'd like to think so.

## how much longer is that going to take?
about six minutes.

## why?
because i seriously doubt we have six minutes.

## can we be of service?
chief.

## how may i be of service?
sonny.

## you stay home honing your ability to program a vcr?
my vcr's been flashing 1 2:00 for three years.

## what else, roger?
oh, driving a standard shift.

## go ahead and chuckle, okay?
but until women evolve the ability to move objects telepathically and they will physical strength remains a primary utility.

## barbecuing?
sex.

## you think you can handle that?
lnterestingly, a group of scientists in england... just announced their intention to fertilize an egg... without the use of sperm cells.

## but are men absolutely necessary?
i don't know that.

## what is the most sensitive part of the vagina?
i can't believe we've gotten into this.

## evolution is looking out for us girls?
exactly.

## ls there any species that just has one gender... that doesn't have male/ female?
starfish, for one.

## ls that a principle of nature?
we all sit around reading subway maps together.

## so, what does this mean?
we have to take orders from joyce for the rest of lives.

## what?
i'm done.

## where did you get those?
copied them from yours.

## when?
last week when you sent me for bagels.

because he's a player.

## am i hot or cold?
it's a good story.

## why should i tell you?
telling you isn't going to change anything.

i'm telling the truth as i see it.

## you wanna go fuck your boss?
what business is it of mine.

## you waiting for someone?
yeah, my fianc.

## does he treat you with respect?
not that it's any of your business, but, yes, he does.

## can i help you, sir?
hey.

## where's that other guy?
the  he's home sleeping.

## why don't i just leave her a note?

we're playing phone tag.

## she did?
well, there's not a whole lot to show you, nick.

## what do i do all day?
i sit here and think of ways to make people feel bad.

## why not?
because it's a substitution game.

## everyone's missing something, right?
well, yeah.

## so... is it fun?
it can be.

## back at the office, you know?
that's standing meditation.

## why should you calm down?
you're a teenager.

## like fear and pain, you know?
it's a visualization.

## so, how's your folks?
they got divorced.

## what?
yeah.

## when did this happen?
a while ago.

## how's your mom doing?
she's fine.

## so when's your interview?

## how'd it go?
fine, i guess.

## why keep going to school... when anything i need to find out about i can look up myself?
dad didn't go to college.

all right.

## sex is everywhere, okay?
it is all around us.

## okay?
do that, and i promise you a whole world will open up.

## what do i do?
for starters, let's get rid of that little meditation.

## let what in?
there are millions of women in this city.

## are you blowing my cover like some construction worker?
no.

## okay?
give it a few seconds.

## watch.
do you think women have a clue what goes on up here?

## my eyes?
your eyes.

## how's your vision?
no, it's good.

## peripheral?
i don't know.

## that's it?
you need a hundred, a hundred and ten degrees... before you're ready for the street.

## you play video games?
sure.

## you have to learn to anticipate your opportunities, okay?
young people sitting in cars in ohio.

## remember, there's no shame in calling on an old standby, right?
dropping of the pencil.

## what, in school?
no, there's no mirrors.

## now, see?
that shows me you're using your faculties.

## don't they know we can see in there?
of course they do.

## are women gonna walk around with their hands clamped to their sides?
no.

## so all this looking is fine, but how do you take the next step?
i need to meet someone.

## do you think this is a joke?
no.

## why do you think i'm here?
you have got to make sex a presence...

## what?
no.

## who cares?
you're overcomplicating it.

## you spend the whole night sitting here thinking of the perfect line... what good is that?
just make contact.

## lf he's got such good taste, what's he doing hanging out with you?
good question.

## because he's my uncle?
how awful for you.

## no big deal, right?
now she's aware of our presence, and we can plot our strategy.

## a hook?
a hook.

## oh, yeah?
yeah.

## ls he playing a little joke on us?
no, no.

## a bet?
uh huh.

## really?
love.

## that's a hard thing to verify, don't you think?
no, i think we can do it.

## a thousand dollars?
that's not exactly mind blowing... but it's not the worse line i'il hear tonight.

## really?
yeah.

## so, do we rate a sit down?
i'm waiting for a friend.

## lf we do, who sits with who?
ladies choice.

## what is this?
rum and coke.

## you kidding me?
take a drink.

## loss of inhibition is crucial to your success tonight, okay?

please.

## why?
my father owns the bar.

## what time is it?
it's about 7:02.

## do you have a medicalert bracelet?
no, it's instructions.

## do you mean ever?
come on.

## michael jordan?
michael jordan.

## why was he the greatest?
because he paced himself.

## see those guys over there?
yeah.

## i want it.
what?

## okay?
i go to high school.

## you don't think that's torture?
this is a lot of information.

## how many boys your age get an opportunity like this?
yes.

## so... how often do you, like... you know, like, get somebody to go home with you?
every night.

## what?
here we go.

## how'd you get in here, nick?
it's funny you should... ask me that.

## he's got to get someone to fall in love with him?
a woman.

## lf nick is willing to exploit that little loophole, he can have the money.
a woman?

## what were you guys talking about?
i don't know.

## what were we talking about?
we were talking about women.

## you'd rather be completely anonymous?
not completely anonymous.

## you would love it if no woman ever listened to a word you were saying... and just kept her eyes locked on your chest or your crotch?
lf it led to having sex all the time, i would not mind.

## you could deal with never being heard, never being taken seriously?
lf i had something that needed saying, i would wait until right after sex.

## here's a little suggestion, okay?
putting on makeup.

## do you think you have any control over who you find attractive?
of course we do.

## and what do they invariably answer?
sense of humor.

## you see?
sorry.

## give me the lce age, okay?
survival of the fittest.

## why can't you just close your eyes and concentrate on the feeling?
it's not the most flattering activity for a woman.

## well, maybe to make sure that it's actually happening?
i'il buy that.

## file it away for what?
oh.

## like what kind of thing?
like how she flips her hair.

## what's wrong with that?
because that's nothing.

## yeah?
i can't describe it exactly... but it's like there's nothing she can do.

## have you met my nephew?
his name is jesus.

## how old are you, nick?
i'm 1 6.

## are we still on a one drink limit?
i think we can have one more.

## who wants what?
sophie knows what i like.

## nick?
a player might consider taking advantage of this time alone with andrea.

## what's the deal with your uncle?
i don't know.

## do you live in the city?
i live in ohio with my mom.

## do you have a girlfriend back home?
no.

## nick, can you do me a favor?
okay.

## what's that?
that's a conversational lag... that often occurs after the ordering of the second round.

## what do you think happened, nick?
my mom's a lot older than roger.

## really?
i didn't know that.

## like father, like son?
no, like daughter.

## what do you mean, \"like daughter?
no joke.

## she's just what do you call it?
high functioning.

## how can you joke about that?
you can joke about anything that has to do with yourself.

## lsn't that right, nick?
i think that's constitutional or something.

## you know what?
i need the ladies room.

## are you sure you want to get laid tonight?
i thought you would like to know that.

## all right?
we were talking about granddad.

## i figured  you felt qualified to jump in... and expound on that particular topic?
that's right.

## ln bridge, you have two sets of partners, okay?
lf you hope to become the kind of man... that other men choose to go into battle with... you have to learn to read your partner.

## don't you think that's slightly more fertile ground... than what's at the bottom of your mother's laundry basket?

## maybe they ran out of money?
i don't think so.

## find out something?
our ms. eva was born to nobility.

## a little princess, huh?
well, that explains the hideous decor.

## so why's our princess staying in a place like this...... with all those fakes?
their relationship didn't last long.

## what happened to carlo?
right before they were married, he...

## murdered, to be precise.
died, right?

## by who?
the magnetic field's kicking up.

## hey, did you hear that?

## who are you?
hey, you're...

## now can i go into space with you too?
sure you can.

## well, your papa is a rocket specialist.
really?

## but...
mama, did you hear?

## that's important to you, isn't it?
you'il get it dirty.

## right, papa?
emily, don't bother your father.

## mama, can i have the jam?
emily, you didn't eat your cucumbers again.

## what's going on?
emily.

## heintz, do you read?
yeah, i'm all right.

## what's with those dolls?
he's been acting like that for a while.

## i'il always be with you, eva.
do you see eva?

## where are you, miguel?
the debris...

## why do you interfere?
carlo lives forever.

## what?
you of all people know what i mean.

## you what?
in my memories, he will never change his mind.

## don't you understand?
sure, anytime.

## isn't that just what we wanted?
just hold on.

## you mean the roses?
of course i mean you, eva.

## you mean you don't think about me all the time?
i always think about you.

## oh, so you're here again today?
this year's cold is a real bugger to shake.

## mr. kawasaki?
thank you very much, doctor.

## so, what's wrong with you?
well, i have a cold.

## all better now?
well, i still have a fever...... but i don't feel like staying home alone.

## why don't you test out all the over the counter cold medicines?
get better and it'il kill two birds with one stone.

## why don't you try that new fever medicine we're putting out?
i saw a sample on the chief's desk.

## are these them?
red capsules...... in a blue case.

## what's that smell?
yeah, maybe somebody's eating something.

## who came into my office?
nobuo tanaka went in there a little while ago...... and took a sample of the new medicine.

## where is he now?
he was just here.

## he said he didn't feel well and went to the guest room to take a nap.
where did he go?

## are you sure?
yeah.

## great.
is something wrong with that new fever medicine?

## same as yesterday.
why didn't somebody wake me?

## did the chief turn it off?
an accident has occurred.

## who are you?
well...

## well, the chief's here...
where's ohmaeda?

## what's ohmaeda doing on the floor?
i don't know.

## what?
patch in the other monitors.

## and who are you?
tanaka.

## well, it was like this when i woke up.
when?

## i called an ambulance, but they aren't here yet.
what?

## you called an ambulance?
yes, and the police too.

## what?
my god.

## you said your name was tanaka?
yes, sir.

## what do you mean?
this accident...

## orders from the government?
exactly.

## this isn't fever medicine?
but i took some.

## what's wrong?
atsugi base is full.

## mr. kamata, president of nishibashi pharmaceuticals...... and mr. nirasaki, head of development.
do you read me, niigata?

## you gentlemen mind telling me what the hell's going on?
i'm coming to you from the sasago tunnel on the chuoh freeway.

## so we formed a secret research team of our employees.
what's happening in the valley?

## you're saying you were ordered to develop a weapon?
no, it's for protection from a weapon.

## how powerful?
we're analyzing computer data from the research center now.

## how long since they got here?
i've got a report in.

## but what?
according to data from sensors we've placed in the area...... the center of the disaster is moving.

## what?
i think the gas generated by the accident...... is being carried by the wind.

## you have a sample?
yes, the young man who reported this accident should have it.

## what do you mean?
well, we tried to keep the secret papers and the sample from outsiders.

## you're telling me there's a survivor down there?
oh, dear.

## can you explain it more clearly?
well, yes.

## so, what should we do?
well, we have to keep him emotionally stable...... with his metabolism controlled at the same time...

## can you see this long trail of gas, ladies and gentlemen?
the target is still moving.

## why can't they stop him?
the airport is now over crowd capacity.

## but, commander, your excellency, what about you?
yes.

## you're trying to capture him alive, aren't you?
the prime minister has given up.

## probably looking for me.
surely you won't complain if we try?

## what?
the whole thing's turned into a real pain.

## what are you doing here?
you can't just come in here and...

## have you heard anything yet?
the level...

## nirasaki, are you sure?
yes, sir.

## see?
now it's gone down to...

## why can't you get up any earlier?

i heard they were in bed with the higher ups.

## ready for cannon ascension.

## the chief really did that?
that's why he was transferred.

## it'il be lights out soon.

## a phone?
yeah, for my business.

## did you sleep well?

## have you considered that this might make you late for your party?
i can't take money for nothing.

## about 40 minutes or so, right?

## it'il only take 15 minutes if i fly there fast.
so, why don't we take a little break?

## would you care for some tea?
i just made it fresh.

## won't you be late for your party?
it smells fine, so you'd better hurry.

## besides, the food will get cold if we stop.

## yes, what is it?
i have a delivery.

## grandma sent over another one of her crummy herring pies again.
who is it?

## um, could you please sign this receipt for me?
i hate grandma's stupid pies.

## doesn't matter anyway, i can't go in these wet clothes.

## do you have a headache?
you have quite a fever.

## is someone pounding on my head?
i'il bet you never dried yourself off completely yesterday.

i'm okay.

## what went wrong?
i pedaled too hard.

## how did it make you feel, the first time you ever went flying?
i can't recall.

## you just found out?
i used to think you were some sort of clown.

## hey, who's your girlfriend?
thats kiki, she's a witch.

## i'm positive that's her.
kiki, come on over ok?

## you mean she's a working girl?
my, how independent.

## what are you mad about?
i'm not mad at all.

## i'm losing my witchs powers.
what are you talking like a cat for?

## have you lost your magic?
it has become very weak, so i think i've gotta take a break from delivery work.

## will your power come back after you've rested?
it's me, tombo.

## did you see me today?
please, don't call me anymore.

## what?
i can barely hear you.

## what's wrong?
you don't look like you feel well.

## do yuo have some milk?

## that's bad huh?
tell your boss you need a break.

## must've been blind, with two beautiful girls wating in front of him.
how about it, pussy cat?

## what do you mean, you thought i was a boy?
well, look at the way you're dressed.

## i've been waiting for you to come back to get it right.
like it?

## you mean that's me?
yes, it is.

## would you be my model?
but i'm not very beautiful.

## why do you want me?
you've got a great face.

## then what happens?
kiki, don't move, don't look over here.

## at times like that, you know what i do?
paint.

## to fly, you do chant a spell or something, right?
mm hmmm.

## the witch's spirit?
perfect, that's what i'm talking about.

## why?
it's so beautiful.

## can i visit you once in a while?

mm.

## should i tell her no?
i've told her you'd be away for some time, but she kept insisting.

## kiki, would you open the box?
yes.

## would you please deliver it to a girl named kiki?
she was kind to me and a tremendous help.

## and would you find out when her next birthday may be?
then i'il be able to bake her another one.

## what happened?
that boy is holding on for dear life.

## kiki, did you borrow your fathers radio again without permission?
it's one of our old customs.

## time flies so quickly, doesn't it?
i'm afraid so.

## after i'm gone, who will make this medicine?
i think its better to leave with decorum and great dignity.

## you look just like your mother did when she was your age.
if we put it off for a month... and i find some wonderful boyfriend, then what?

## daddy... would you pick me up like you used to?
well...

## how come you never told me you were growing up so fast?
you can always come home if things don't work out.

## don't worry, kiki will be fine.
come back to my old room?

## a big town?
kiki, its almost time.

## thats the broom you're leaving on?
yeah, i just made it.

## pretty cute huh?
it is cute, but you can't start witchin on a broom that's too small.

## but i worked so hard on it, right jiji?
your mothers broom would be better.

## which way are we headed?
i think south, to the ocean.

## where's leon?
john, call mr. kodak and tell him the president's waiting.

## are you all right?

the poll also tells us what we already know.

security briefing, sir.

## you wanted to see me?
i just spoke with a. j. maclnerney.

## how soon can you deploy them?
we can airlift them in the morning.

## any security concerns?
if anybody wanted to hit it, they'd have hit it by now.

## yes, sir?
when we're out of the office... and alone, you can call me andy.

## i beg your pardon?
you were the best man at my wedding.

## so how are we doing?
you're four minutes ahead of schedule.

## ahead?
gee, that's unprecedented.

## our full support?
yes, he is.

## how are you today?

of course.

## mr. president  have you ever been in the oval office?
i've just been on the regular tour.

## i'il grant you that.
do you think i'm mad at you?

## how do you know until you put the weight of the white house behind it?
sydney, at 20%, we're 34 votes shy in the house.

## twenty four votes?
if you can swing 24 votes by the state of the union...

## do i have your word on that, sir?
absolutely.

## listen, are you hungry?
i skipped breakfast.

## coffee or something?
the g. d. c. has been at every president for the last decade and a half.

## with all due respect, who's going to stop me?
well, if you go through that door, the united states secret service.

## should i meet with them?
let lewis take a pass at them first.

## you won't even call me by my name when we're playing pool?
i beg your pardon, sir.

## sydney wade?
she wanted to apologize one more time for her behavior.

## ms. wade?
when she called.

## did she say anything about you?
it's just that we had a nice couple of minutes together.

## she didn't say anything about me?
well, no, sir, but i could pass her a note before study hall.

## don't i sound serious?
the president can't just go out on a date.

## why not?
no, this is the white house.

## how is that different from what wilson did?
the difference is he didn't have to be president on television.

## so what are you saying?
i'm saying we'il take a hit.

## how big?
five points, maybe more.

## we're talking about five points?
it could be more.

## give her a call.
do you want me to have kodak put together some numbers?

## you've met some stranger?
oh, he's not a stranger.

## where?
after all, i am sixteen. it isn't that, dear.

## betrothed?
since the day you were born.

## a place to raise their little brood, eh?

## do you still think it's a dream?
it's a nightmare.

## what the hell is he doing in the water?
it's an aircraft carrier, sir.

## senator samuel chapman?
that's right.

## now, what do we do about it?
skipper, what we do about it is blow them out of the water.

## the u. s. s. nimitz declares war on thejapanese empire?
that's what we'd be doing.

## what kind of possibilities, mr. lasky?
possibilities for the future, mr. owens.

## and if i can never be born, how can i go back in history and meet my very own grandfather?
i'm not half the theorist you are, mr. lasky but i still have a gut instinct that things only happen once.

## how are you gonna avoid it?
it's already happening, and we're already involved.

## some half ass princeton debating society?
we are in a war situation.

## and after that?
after that, we take our orders from the commander in chief of the united states armed forces.

## you in command of this ship?
oh, hardly.

## is that what happened?
i'm not in a position to...

## do i?
ironically, the senator disappeared and was presumed dead following the attack he had foreseen so clearly.

## why'd you keep it to yourself?
i don't have your appetite for playing god with the world.

## what was i supposed to do, throw him back in the sea?
at least that would have preserved the natural order of history as you've written it.

## who the hell are these people?
the navy.

## but what part of it?
i've never seen machines like they got onboard this thing.

## and where have they been developing aircraft like that?
the navy would have to appear before my committee and i've never even heard a whisper about it.

## what the hell's going on here?
yeah, roosevelt.

## and who's sitting out here with no press while the white house takes all the credit for raising the alarm and being ready to hit back?
whoever he is, he's either too scared or too well briefed to talk about it.

## how the hell do we know what he's saying if we can't understand him?
we need a translator to tell him we need a translator.

## does he say why?
because he wants to warn his commander about us.

## or else?
he will kill again.

## do you think there's a chance they might believe him?
you're an expert on what's gonna happen tomorrow tell him about it, for god's sakes.

## how in the hell do you know all that?
your code is \"climb mount niitaka.

## what's going on?
please, miss scott, don't ask me any questions.

## where's my dog?
we'il find him, miss scott.

## and is it true?
yes, sir.

## did you inform pearl harbor command?
no, senator.

## why the hell not?
well, the reasons are a little complicated, but, uh, believe me, senator this carrier is capable of handling any attack should it occur.

## what kind of an idiot do you take me for?
senator, calm down.

## wouldn't you like to talk to them with some clothes on?
thank you, captain.

## are you all right?
yes, sir, i'm fine.

## can you do that, captain?

## how's it going so far?

## shall we?
miss scott, i'm matt yelland, skipper of this ship.

## charlie?

## just got enough time to drop them off on a deserted spot on this island.

## not pearl, sir?

## you wanna come with me?

## this is roppongi club...
why giving me criminal record all the sudden?

## that story again?

## she still needs more money huh?
lf she has problem with money in new york...

## that's not...
do you know her parent's phone number?

## what is?
the erection...

## what?
you really...

## mind if i sit down?
no.

## brok.
is this why you've come, dragonslayer's wife?

## your majesty?
no one is above the code... especially the king.

## where?
there, there.

## we made a bargain, remember?
one dragon put down, one bag of gold.

## your honor has a price, sir knight?
it has expenses.

## might we travel together?
the road's still free, unless einon's taxed it.

## hmm?
a road tax.

## care to double the wager?
ah, yes, happily.

## shall we say the water bucket?
double again.

## why not?
i say.

## shall i spice it up with a poetical flourish... or just the cold, hard facts?
if you do not be quiet... you and i shall be the only things that are cold and hard around here.

## but if a dragon falls in the forest and nobody gets to hear about it, does it make a thud?
brother gilbert.

## if i were you, i'd quit while i was ahead.
what?

## that was good.

a truce.

## how do i know i can trust you?
if you win, you lose a trade.

## my word is my bond.
hmm?

## about what?
well, such deception hardly befits a knight of the old code.

when you squeeze the nobility, it's the peasants who feel the pinch.

## why should i stick my neck out for people afraid to risk their own?
his blade defends the helpless.

## oh, is it?
i should think you'd welcome death.

## do you delight in reminding me?

## you?
wet.

## so how's the knee?
they're never gonna make me a general anyway.

## why am i here?
i'm curious about that myself, sir.

## osborne, do i look like a \"sir \"to you?
not particularly, sir.

## how does that make you feel?
hostile and uncooperative, sir.

## not west?
oh, tell me it wasn't west.

## you know sergeant west, sir?
he was our black hat.

## so the problem is that three didn't come back?
no.

## captain, will you excuse us for a moment?
all due respect to osborne, this is way out of her league.

## fbl?
not exactly.

## what does that mean?
there was a group of guys down here and they....

## and they what?
come on, bill, spill it.

## permission to speak freely, sir?
osborne, i swear to god...... you call me sir one more time, i'm gonna scream.

## who would name their kid levi?
general jonathan kendall, of the joint chiefs.

## is he in an interrogation room?
yes, sir.

## why?
interrogation rooms tend to look suspiciously like interrogation rooms...... which makes people uncomfortable.

## does he slouch or sit up?
these are questions that reveal a great deal about a man's character.

## get over yourself for two and a half seconds and tell me, is he cute?
yes, sir.

## not scratching your balls?
look for both.

## any donuts around here?
i questioned him for two hours.

## you try poking him with a stick?
sorry, no.

## did they feed you yet?
go on.

## you want another one?
maybe later.

## you like baseball?
oh, i could talk baseball for days.

## you wanna talk baseball?
oh, come on, ray, we gotta talk about something.

## who do you like?
sir, i don't like baseball.

## why not?
i believe the game of baseball to be too slow.

## too slow?
it's a game of anticipation.

## he still got that?
hand carved.

## he ever do that to you guys?
oh, yeah.

## what west used to do is he would say that he could...... slice a man from stem to sternum, the stem being your dick, okay?
i get it.

## by the way, ray, i promised i would ask where west and the others are...... and can they be found?
there's no need.

## they're dead, aren't they?
yes, sir.

## i don't wanna play games with you...... so i say we take a break.
you kill them?

## okay?
and get you another donut.

## \"deep fry your ass\"?
you set me up.

## you think he did it?
no, sir.

## what about the rest of my people?
in 5 1/ 2 hours, it'il be out of our hands.

## why did you ask for a ranger?
i'm not telling you what happened.

## why don't you tell us about the others?
tell us about the course.

## is he still the same prick?
i do not care that you are triple volunteers.

## unfortunate accidents that i will not hesitate to repeat...... if you cross me.
is that understood?

## is that understood?
sergeant, my name is pike, sergeant.

## are you implying something negative about the great state of mississippi?
from the beginning, west had a chip on his shoulder for this guy named pike.

## mr. pike...... can you tell me the muzzle velocity of an m 16?
yeah.

## eleven hundred what?
meters per second, sergeant.

## too tired to think?
zero, schmuck.

## have you lost it?
well, tell me this.

## what is your weapon?
your weapon, man.

## what is your weapon?
it's your brain, mr. pike.

## are you concerned for their safety?
sergeant....

## what?
no, sergeant.

## those are the guys that went on the exercise with you?
yeah, and that is all i'm saying.

## is this a trick where you won't give me a cigarette till i tell you more?
no, i just forgot mine in the car, and i was hoping that you had some.

## what did you do to make mueller want to kill you?
i'm not saying anything else.

## so?
ranger code.

## what's the matter?
this place gives me the willies.

## not the happiest of memories, huh?
no.

## tommy, that you?
pete vilmer, as i live and breathe.

## how are you?
i'm good.

## let me guess, you two trained together?
guilty as charged, julie bird.

## packing up supplies...... getting ready for the move stateside.
what are you doing here?

## who'd have thunk it?
pete vilmer, bettering society.

## shall we see kendall or would you like to continue...... the backslapping for a couple of minutes?
julie bird.

## oh, i've seen you around the base before, but...... well, are you in the army or...?
coast guard.

## we were wondering if you'd answer a few questions for us?
oh, no.

## oh, you wanna know what happened?
well, there are degrees of truth, captain.

## you know how i can tell?
because you're sweating, and you're sweating...... because you don't know how much dunbar told us already.

## those were kid gloves?
i thought i did pretty well up till the end.

## you mean when you yelled at him and walked out?
well, that would be the end, yeah.

## go back?
we just blew it.

## will you just wait?
just wait.

## for what?
excuse me.

## shall we?
my father is what you would call a very powerful man.

## and how is that going for you?
oh, it's horrible.

## you're terrified of him, aren't you?
no, no, we just hate each other.

## so is this family history lesson coming to a point?
about four months ago, i began a relationship with a local...... and my father decided to intercede.

## more intrigue, levi?
yes.

## did anyone else see or hear this?
no, of course not.

## there was a helicopter, you know?
nobody could hear anything.

## what happened to degrees?
i didn't kill him.

## then who did?
west.

## what did you do?
we found him like this.

## you kill him?
we found him like this.

## where's pike?
we got separated.

## yeah?
yeah, we did.

## before or after the explosion?
i don't know.

## radio's had it.
what do you mean?

## are we gonna leave him like this?
we have to.

## what about pike?
i'm not waiting for pike.

## where's pike?
west is dead.

## what happened?
he took a phosphorus grenade in the back.

## are you kidding me?
no.

## how long have you guys been here?
ten minutes.

## that's your story?
she just doesn't remember if it was before or after the explosion.

## now?
yeah.

## now you remember?
before the explosion.

## yeah, let's see it, nunez.
hear me?

## nunez?
let's see that.

## are you happy now?
here it is.

## you see it?
so sorry to disappoint you.

## so, what happened?
must be a level three out there.

## you okay?
yeah.

## pike, you got your grenade?
no, i used it.

## you know west is dead?
of course i do.

## he admitted it?
he thought we would all be on board.

## all right?
now, all we gotta do is get rid of mueller and nunez.

## mueller was chasing dunbar?
because he had shot castro.

## why did he carry you out?
i don't know.

## and you'il testify to this?
of course.

## what did dunbar say to you?
let's go have a beer.

## who doesn't drink beer?
me.

## what about the case?
the case is done, with two hours and 40 minutes to spare.

## you believed kendall?
absolutely.

## why?
because he did it.

## what's that have to do with it?
that means less than a year.

## from dunbar?
forget it.

## nevertheless what?
kendall will testify.

## why didn't you say something?
we would've dropped the charges.

## you got something to say?
say it.

## what drugs?
he sold them out of the hospital for 50 bucks a pop.

## ... and i'm all ears, right?
it's not like that.

## pike did.
then why didn't you bring this up before you were accused of murder?

## you think you know everything, don't you?
you haven't even scratched the surface.

## excuse me?
the next time...... i wanna borrow your balls, i'il ask you.

## where are you going?
i'm done.

## why don't you confess?
the only reason you brought me here...... was to protect your career.

## there's your fucking confession.
what are you taking about?

## what about what he said about the drugs?
forget it.

## so fuck the army, right?
fuck the army and fuck those kids too.

## isn't that what you said?
i was trying to get your number.

## what?
that's what dunbar said.

## you saw west's body?
of course i did.

## where?
down by the creek bed.

## and he was shot?
yeah.

## what about the phosphorus grenade?
one went off, yeah, but it didn't touch him.

## what did you do?
we found him like this.

## we didn't see mueller till we got back to the bunker.
you kill him?

## where you been?
west.

## mueller was alone in the bunker?
yeah.

## what are you doing here alone?
pike and i got separated, then i heard gunfire.

## so where's your grenade?
and i didn't buy it, but mueller still had his grenade.

## okay, what happened next?
pike came back.

## where were you?
one minute you're next to me, the next you're gone...

## there's a hurricane out there, okay?
i couldn't find the spot.

## where's west?
yeah, right.

## we wanna see your pack because....
what?

## why?
because whoever shot the sarge popped a grenade first.

## a dead body shows up and just put it on the darkest face in the room?
it's not like that and you know it.

## do i, dunbar?
i just want you, papi, to show them your pack.

## ray?
come here.

## ray, we're friends, right?
yeah.

## did you check your pack coming in on the bird?
look, you know i don't have this in me.

## lf not you, then who?
mueller, that's who.

## we were scanning the area together then he just ups and disappears?
that's what he says about you.

## who you gonna believe...... a redneck or your friend?
listen, check my pack.

## why?
that's a combat cocktail.

## does that look like i'm lying?
it kills the pain, focuses the brain, man.

## they must've sabotaged the radios and...... one of them must've taken a grenade out of my pack on the chopper.
they?

## you saw west's body.
who popped white?

## how was he killed?
his chest was hamburger, jake.

## now, how about mueller?
when i walked in, he wasn't wearing shit.

## come on, ray.
what don't you know?

## we all know what you did, pike.
what the hell are you doing?

## my shirt?
maybe you brought an extra shirt.

## you too?
i'm sorry, ray.

## can i get another cup of coffee?
yeah.

## butt fucked the bunker\"?
well, i just well, you know.

## what do you think?
i think we're gonna need proof.

## ray?
for you to have any chance of coming out of this...... we need to corroborate your testimony.

## how long you and pete been together?
on and off for two years.

## serious?
semi.

## for you or for him?
you don't get to interrogate me, hardy.

## know about the drugs?
sorry, i gotta ask.

## i need that consult report on the chart.
did you?

## on the chart, okay?
yes, sir.

## piece of advice?
charming's not the tack to take with us right now.

## excuse me?
no, you can't have a lawyer.

## how about them yankees?
now, peter, what i just did is illegal.

## now, do you really want to go round two?
i got them hooked, i had them push, once they were in, they couldn't get out.

## who do you think administered the tests?
i swapped their dirty piss for someone else's clean.

## who else was involved?
mueller and that kid who took a bullet.

## how'd you recruit them?
you know how it is in panama, tommy.

## when did west find out?
i didn't know he knew.

## how long have you been doing this?
gee, i wasn't looking at my watch.

## while we were fucking?
yeah.

## riggs?
yes, ma'am.

## why would he risk 20 years in prison just to sell a few painkillers?
doesn't add up.

## how far do you want to go with this?
i think we should go see bill, hand over vilmer...... give him dunbar's confession and forget about kendall.

## so vilmer admitted to supplying the drugs?
yes.

## understood?
pike never admitted shooting west.

## he was the type of guy that you felt uncomfortable going to sleep around.
why don't you ask him about the murders...... he's covered up for his drug dealer?

## why did you pin three murders on dunbar?
the man saved your life.

## what?
i was just telling you the truth.

## is that what you think you have on me?
it's his drug peddling word against mine.

## what kendall's saying about \"the type of guy you feel uncomfortable...... sleeping next to\"?
that's what dunbar said about mueller.

## you're accessory to murder, you understand that?
you're going to jail.

## right, hardy?
lf he's lucky.

## you know what?
you're full of shit.

## you think we got nothing on you?
that doesn't matter, levi.

## know why?
we'il find one of those bodies...... and i'm gonna make sure it has a bullet in it that matches your weapon.

## captain osborne?
sir.

## what happens to dunbar now?
in 10 minutes he gets on a plane, which means you're done.

## what?
kendall.

## what?
dunbar wrote this when he asked for a ranger.

## fbl?
not exactly.

## what's that mean?
they went rogue.

## they're ghosts, right?
they're dead.

## how could you keep that from me?
ma'am.

## what the hell happened to you two?
none of your business.

## hey, julie bird, you bitch...... why don't you go on and get me something to eat?
i'm starving.

## what did you say?
i didn't mean to call her a bitch.

## what, that me and pike were on a transport plane going to d. c. together?
you mean dunbar.

## why not?
tom...... ray dunbar is black.

## where's this transport going from?
i need to take him back for questioning  we're not finished with you yet, pike.

## well, well, well.

## you know the rest.
so, what's it gonna be?

## how'd you get kendall to go along with switching dunbar's dog tags?
i gave him a choice.

## how about the bodies?
that hurricane almost lifted me off the ground.

## so you'il testify to all of this?
i don't think you're gonna get any deals.

## did you get what you wanted?
not even close.

## oh, really?
okay.

## now, why would he wait until the end of the week to tell you?
i mean, that doesn't sound like the west that we knew.

## you think the kid was lying?
no.

## what?
i do.

## i think that west came to you  and?
and you told mueller and kendall to kill him.

## what?
i just found out.

## was that really the pathologist?
no, that was my message service.

## even if it was, does that prove anything?
you keep forgetting...... i don't have to.

## what?
i don't have to prove anything...

## why don't you cut yourself a break, for chrissake?

## or is it pike?
the idea that you just transferred into his unit.

## so you're all section 8?
i told you she was smart.

the story is there.

## but why did he hand it to me?
it's a classic spin.

## listen, i'il be back in 10 minutes.
so schou knew mads story would emerge during the election?

## what do you do at the trust?
i'm an accountant.

## what do you know?
your boss has spent 13 million on a non existent hospital.

## how come the board wasn't informed?
mads ran the project on his own.

## okay?
i have a lot of respect for mads, so this is hard...

## why doesn't the board intervene?
we were about to.

## they came this morning?
lone must have the party's complete support.

## did you talk to kaj?
i gave him a bypass road for his vote.

## i just wanted to see who was paying us a visit.
i thought you were resting?

## coffee?
no.

## yes?
hello, ulrik torp, daily news.

## it was an emergency.
can i help you?

## are you leaving?
yes, i...

## parliament!?
only for a couple of days.

## what do you say, boss?
well done.

## can you cut it down to 30 lines?
according to a recent opinion poll the centre party is still ahead...

## what's the number?
it's right there.

## the lodge?
all the journalists, the mps and their spin doctors.

## see the journalists over there?
they're sucking up to peter schou.

## know why?
cause he could become their prime source after the elections.

## say hello to erik.
absurd, isn't it?

## erik...?
torp.

## did gunnar tell you how we spent nights finalizing budget proposals?
erik is the incumbent premier...

## can't you see what she is doing?
we've got two positive write ups in the papers today.

## aksel situation?
yes.

## what do you mean?
he may be all right.

## nothing more specific?
no.

## ulrik torp speaking.
but dreier was allowed to see him?

## what the hell is that?
hotel receipts...

## somebody thinks you deserve all the best stories, eh?
it's from the centre party.

## how did you know i was here?
you're not the only one i know on the force.

## and?
a half built hospital in cambodia...

## and the missing millions?
i can't reveal information about our sources.

## you just thanked them?
the top brass say be friendly with the legislative powers...

## will you be cutting school budgets?
no, we'il give you longer weekends.

## what am i doing here 10 days before an election?
ulrik torp wants an interview at 5 o'clock.

## he bought it?
of course.

## have we got anything on him?
i'il dig something up.

## did you know that?
these were aksel's.

## life is too short for performance theatre, right?
i have questions regarding mads kjeldsen.

## are you running by any chance?
aksel is our chairman, and as long as he's alive, he's our man.

## i wouldn't make a point of repeating it, if i intended to run, would i?
so you're not a candidate.

## are you having trouble hearing me?
lone kjeldsen on holiday sounds better.

## why didn't you come to me with it?
it's an important story.

## a politician trying to kill off another?
happens every day.

## and the holiday story?
it's your story.

## who's heading the party right now?
aksel bruun is still our leader.

## will you be wearing that?
men in dinner jackets.

## why not elect kjeldsen now?
it's not party procedure.

## why won't the doctors say anything?
i don't know.

## but isn't it strange?
yes.

## haven't you got a friend there?
yes.

## is mads case swinging things?
no.

## mads?
i'm okay.

## are you expecting?
no.

## is this fish?
fish doesn't agree with me.

## what the hell is going on?
schou planted the story for dreier.

## are you out of your mind?
you'il ruin your career.

## what do i tell the guests?
we just took our seats.

## thanks.
simon...?

## how is she?
stop it.

## what do you think?
i think it's hot air.

## why do you ask then?
dreier will move in for the kill today.

## are your getting cold feet?
no.

## is that appropriate?
10 years ago a prime minister lied about some telephone calls.

## will you pass this around?
we'il lose this election, if we don't make a decision now.

## how can you go out at such a time?
i'm here on aksel's behalf.

## doesn't his condition affect you?
of course it does.

## are you running?
let's see what the mps decide.

## we conducted a poll yesterday. say they would vote for erik today.
from the hospital?

## they wouldn't happen to be the members in schou's files?
it's foolish to wrangle over the party leadership.

## why don't you leave the party, kolt?
no, i'm serious.

## so why not avoid the humiliation?
you can't threaten me like that.

## and things are getting unpleasant?
it's aksel's wife...

## simon?
their son.

## why would they keep aksel alive, if he's technically dead?
i need to know what's going on.

## imagine you were the patient and some stranger asked questions?
i have to go now...

## yes?
ulla.

## does this sound familiar?
dear lone kjeldsen.

## where did you get this?
that's irrelevant.

## is that true?
and your colleagues at the fort say you're uncooperative.

## going it alone?
dreier wants to be prime minister.

## will you buy me a cell phone?
i don't know, darling.

## if i did that, my career in politics would be over.
and why?

## isn't that a price worth paying?
dreier is no worse than all the other power hungry people.

## you're not?
if you hadn't written this story to further your own career...... then maybe i wouldn't have had to bury my husband.

## hey, can i see your id?
you're not listed.

## what?
i've been here since monday.

## perhaps torp would let me finish according to procedure?
you said on the news there was hope, although you knew this to be untrue.

## torp?
hold on a second.

## what did you expect?
school of journalism, class of 1977.

## how do you think he feels, when he makes reporters shush each other?
he's laughing all the way down to his chauffeur driven car.

## or hosting their own crappy tv shows?
some of the mps have been members of extreme right wing groups.

## and how do the papers react to that?
two fucking lines on page 8.

## the soviet union or nazi germany?
and reporters do nothing about it.

## and what do you suggest we do?
there's nothing we can do.

## have you been drinking?
yes.

## what do you mean?
i talked to erik.

## you've talked to erik dreier?
dreier is no crook.

## what are you talking about?
lone kjeldsen as prime minister.

## i can't support a woman, whose reforms would have cost me millions?
it's ridiculous.

## you knew dreier planted the story?
mind your own business, mette.

## was grandpa here?
honey, it's past your bedtime.

## why?
if the story's air tight...

## the chancellor was elected despite that big farming scandal?
nope.

## how does dreier fit in?
simon had to fly home, you know.

## very convenient, no?
hello...

## is simon in?
hello.

## you intended to be home on monday 11th, the day after the accident?
yes, and i had my ticket and all, but suddenly the plane was full.

## did you book for the 14th yourself?
no, parliament took care of it.

## and you couldn't fly earlier?
it must be easy from buenos aires.

## because of my dad, you mean?
we weren't too close, he and i.

## oh, you won't write that, will you?
of course not.

## simon, which airline did you fly on the 14th?
sas.

## is that true?
look at that.

## what have they got?
that's what we have to find out.

## we didn't cancel it?
but he was not on the plane.

## was he booked for the 14th on the same destination?
okay, thanks...

## what about the 11th?
they don't give out information about passenger lists.

## what was his girlfriend's name?
birgitte...

## they go to dreier's place.
could you print that out?

## to dreier's place?
no way.

## why not?
somebody could have seen simon.

## what do you want more than anything else at 22?
i don't know.

## pussy?
he already has that.

## so we base the story on simon confessing the whole thing?
it's been a while.

## so what can i do for you?
your son has joined forces with henrik moll.

## and what can i do about that?
i need to know what he's up to.

## you got him the job in parliament through vestgaard, right?
if things got sticky, you figured ulrik would be loyal to his old dad.

## stab my own son in the back?
i have an idea.

## but what's it all about?
charges of harassment.

## yes, what is it?
come with me, please.

## is this some kind of joke?
no.

## what are you saying?
we should stop while we're ahead.

## he'il be on tv tonight, right?
yes.

## have you got proof hidden somewhere maybe?
i have an important message from simon.

## why not?
it's just not done.

## bo, you're the only one, who isn't totally corrupt.
any idea how much shit i'il get from upstairs if i attack him on the air?

## are you going to sell out now?
moll, you sound like my grandma.

## yes?
ulrik torp speaking.

## what do you want?
listen, i feel bad about what happened.

## what story?
they'il print anything, you know.

## but what is the story?
meet me at the thimble bar in 30.

## is it okay to send you down to make up now?
of course...

## what do you want?
erik isn't in.

## what's this all about?
we know dreier kept simon away to postpone bruun's death.

## what are you talking about?
you took simon to dreier's place.

## what's this?
simon's hotel bill.

## so tuesday is the big day, right?
erik dreier to studio 2, please.

## when did you agree to pick him up?
in the morning, after he'd seen gitte in the hospital.

## what the hell was he thinking?
he just wants to be prime minister.

## peter schou?
i have a message from ulrik torp.

## from my grandma?
yes.

## with the cord and everything?
thanks a lot.

## and lone kjeldsen?
she has my sympathies.

## are they?
that sounds good.

## will he use it?
first he has to make dreier admit he didn't know about simon.

## i'il talk to the producer.
jesus, did you see that?

## and who might that be?
you can't broadcast this.

## satisfied?
yes.

## so, when do you find out about this promotion thing?
uh, next month.

## really?
well, when i say lost, i mean it's time that i have to make up.

## fenway frank?
blech.

## what do i owe?
no, they didn't find anything.

## okay, there's another phone call coming in, okay?

## because of this?
no, because i'm becoming someone that i hate.

## please?

## what, you'il be waiting for me?

everyone's like that.

## and you think there's a difference?
yes, i do.

## who the hell is rocky?

## we're good in the cups, aren't we?
mcnab won't play.

## how long will it take to get to birmingham?
couple of hours.

## but we'il be there by two?

## how d'you mean?
i thought you might like to meet jane and the kids for lunch.

## you don't mean instead of the game, do you?
we couldn't do both.

## you didn't get any tickets, did you?
the tickets are waiting for us there.

## we don't have to go to arsenal every time i'm in london, do we?
i thought we were beyond that stage.

## what's going on at the liverpool/ forest game?
there's trouble or something.

## heard about hillsborough?
this guy was just saying.

## what happened?
i dunno.

## you all right?
yeah, i'm fine.

## you can't go back now, can you?
course we will.

## how can you?
because... because everyone else will.

## i hated this afternoon.
what's selfish about watching a football team?

## because if you didn't give a toss about arsenal, what are you left with?
you pay 5 to stand on a lump of concrete.

## but what about this...?
three minutes to go and you're two one up in a semi final.

## you've been as important as the players and if you hadn't been there, who'd have been bothered about football, really?
the great thing is, it comes round again and again.

## what's wrong with that?
yeah.

## and that's good, is it?
it's brilliant.

## we'd want to do it properly, wouldn't we?
liam? lf it's a boy.

## what job?
rosie's head of year job.

## sorry, you were saying?
paul, this is exactly what i mean.

## do you understand?
yes.

## are you prepared to be a one parent family?
i think if we go through with this, one of us is gonna have to be.

## how can i help, anyway?
i changed my mind about that head of year job, if it's not too late.

## any particular reason for the change of mind?
there is, actually, yes.

## history?
yes, yes, of course.

## how does this affect you?
sorry, no.

## i should've told you that straight away, shouldn't l?
anyway, yes, we're having a baby.

## the accidental pregnancy?
not those bits, maybe, but me applying for the job.

## are you a complete fool, paul?
i'il talk to you later.

## all right.
what's the fun of beating a team 1 5 or 20 nil?

## just take it easy, eh?
you've been to see ted.

## the kids?
we could recreate what we did in assembly.

## call me later, ok?
see, if we...

## mr first thing in the morning?
yeah.

## so if everything's as bad as you make out, how come you're not applying for jobs in... pitlochry?
i know paul's gone completely mad.

## like today, right?
i want us to win.

## you never get feelings like that?
i felt brilliant the day we got knocked out of the league by walsall.

## did you go?
yeah.

## we were great, weren't we?
my mum wants a season ticket.

## can i have a quick word?
we're just talking about the rout of norwich.

## just be prepared, ok?
school governors can be a funny lot.

## how often do they play?
once a month.

## do they leave much mess?
no.

## shall i leave you to look around?
thanks, yeah.

## what does it matter how close to the ground you live as long as you can come to the games?
when i was a kid, i read this... story about what used to happen round here on cup final days if arsenal were playing.

## what did we have there?
money, decent schools, holidays abroad, enough food.

## how about darlington?
there's a team there.

## confident?
sorry, not about the job.

## season ticket holder?
yes.

## whereabouts?
er, north bank.

## think we need a new striker?
er...

## what extra mural activites are you involved in?
paul's just coached the under 1 4s to the cup final.

## are they any good?
pretty good.

## oh, is she?
well, no...

## when was the last time you felt this nervous about a league game?
i dunno.

## what we gonna do?
drink, i expect.

## yeah, thanks.
knew they would, didn't l?

## how are you feeling?
sick.

## you think i'd be this upset about a stupid, poxy job interview?
we lost at home to derby today.

## you know how long i've been waiting for this?
yes, i do.

## you think i'd care about that more?
no, you care more about one team scoring more than another.

## you thought i came to comfort you about that?
for a moment, yeah.

## did you wanna be head of year at a north london comprehensive?
i doubt if you've wanted anything for that long.

## leave you alone?
whatever.

## we've both been pretending that this is possible and it's not, is it?
this wife and kids and la di da life's great stuff.

## what ls the point?
i don't think that arsenal's home form is a sturdy enough basis for marriage and parenthood.

## have you had a row?
you have a look.

## what does that mean?
dunno.

## they're famous for being good, aren't they?
gary lineker, peter shilton, all that lot.

## so arsenal have no chance?
none whatsoever, it says here.

## but do we really care that much?
don't bounce it in here.

## are you chewing?
no.

## how are we doing?
losing one nil.

## how long to go?
almost finished.

## it's not what i'm gonna remember, though, is it?
anyway...

## what would you go for?
tomorrow night, of course.

## arsenal are gonna win two nil at anfield.
what?

## can't promise, can l?
there's a chance.

## oh, hi.
what can i say?

## off to watch the big match?
yeah.

## you have to win two nil, right?
yeah.

## it's possible, isn't it?
yeah.

## are you gonna watch?
i'm not sure.

## william?
hate football.

## don't you wanna know how they're getting on?
no.

## mind if miss hughes sticks the tv on?
she wants the football scores.

## you reckon?
i don't.

## what's the use of ok?
might as well be losing eight nil.

## lsn't that just like arsenal?
they need two so they score one just to get us all going.

## you want em to score a second before they scored the first?
and what a game we have now.

## was that it?
brief and to the point.

## whereabouts?
you'd just about forgive an alien from planet tharg but even then, you'd...

## oh...
where you going?

## how much injury time is there?
they've had two minutes already.

## oh, yeah?
you're a lying bastard.

he's taking gavin off.

## what are you thinking about, you german twat?
substitution for newcastle united.

## what are you doing?
i'm sorry, mr. rose...... but i cannot state conclusively...... that the cause of death was natural.

## excuse me, father?
father moore.

## have you seen the news about this priest?
i heard something about an exorcism gone bad, but i don't know the details.

## why me?
they followed the van hopper trial.

## well, what if he won't?
this sounds like a quagmire.

## what are you saying?
i'm saying, you do this for me...... and the rising star keeps rising.

## and just how high do i get to rise this time?
i've been junior partner for too long now, karl.

## may i sit down?
they brought the chair for my public defender.

## why did they choose you?
i wanted this case.

## so you like the spotlight?
i'm used to it.

## are you a catholic?
no.

## do you understand how long they can put you away?
it's been explained to me.

## and this prosecutor, ethan thomas?
you're gonna need somebody hungry and smart...... and aggressive to even have a chance.

## what would your strategy be to defend me against such a formidable man?
that depends.

## on what?
on how you wanna be defended.

## is it how you're being portrayed?
i don't care about my reputation.

## and what is that?
what really happened to emily...... and why.

## was it your fault she died?
no.

## before these troubles began...... was emily a happy girl?
oh, yes.

## mama.
what is going on...?

## is it...?
it's a scholarship, mama.

## can i buy you a drink, mr. thomas?
he makes an excellent martini.

## how do you feel about it?
personally.

## or does that just get in the way of your work?
charges reduced to reckless endangerment.

## have you seen the postmortem photographs?
we'il go to trial.

## we all know what that means, but it's a little abstract, isn't it?
miss bruner, the attorney for the defense...... is seated right next to the man she represents.

## is the defense prepared to make its opening statement?
i'd like to reserve my opening statement...... until the presentation of the defense's case.

## can you describe emily as you knew her growing up?
she was a bit sickly in her early years.

## how did she feel about going to school?
objection.

## did you talk to emily about going off to college?
yes.

## did you stay in touch after she went away?
yes.

## did emily communicate with you again last fall after you received the letter?
actually, it was her mother.

## and after you heard about the dorm room incident...... what were your initial thoughts?
at first, i thought perhaps emily had taken illegal drugs.

## so suspecting that emily was epileptic, how did you proceed?
i administered an electroencephalograph.

## what did the eeg reveal?
it showed a possible epileptic focus in the patient's left temporal lobe.

## did this require a specific treatment?
yes, i began a medication schedule for emily with the drug gambutrol.

## she give any reason for discontinuing these appointments?
yes, she told me she was convinced that her condition was a spiritual one.

## was it your impression that emily had placed her care...... entirely...?
leading the witness.

## after the end of october...... did you ask emily why she had stopped...... filling her gambutrol prescriptions?
yes.

## and what, in your medical opinion...... was the result of father moore's suggestion?
i believe father moore's suggestion killed her.

## doesn't this imply what you observed may not have been an epileptic focus?
yes, that's also possible.

## would father moore's advice to stop taking gambutrol be good advice...... if emily were, in fact, not epileptic?
of course.

## say, for example, psychosis?
yes, i would say that's correct.

## but isn't psychosis an entirely different medical condition from epilepsy?
yes, in my...

## i'm an agnostic, remember?
demons exist, whether you believe in them or not.

## so she believed...... that her possession began at the hospital?
oh, my god.

## emily?
don't touch me.

## she woke me up, you know?
to things i never felt before, things i never knew i could feel.

## ready to proceed?
yes, your honor.

## what was the cause of death, as determined by the autopsy?
the decedent expired due to a gradual shutdown of the bodily functions.

## how did emily get these injuries?
some were the result of violent epileptic seizures...... and some were self inflicted.

## and why, in your opinion, did emily injure herself...... and why did she stop eating?
this is a rare development, to be sure...... but one that i have witnessed numerous times.

## emily was epileptic and psychotic?
yes.

## in your opinion, if emily had continued with her medication...... would she be alive today?
absolutely.

## how do you know that?
it's the inevitable result of taking the drug.

## but wasn't emily still experiencing psychotic symptoms...... even after she started taking the medication?
yes.

## doctor, is \"psychotic epileptic disorder \"a common medical term...... or did you just make it up?
well, i distinguished and named the...

## so psychotic epileptic disorder is really your own pet theory?
objection.

## when emily chose to stop her medical treatment...... what do you think should've been done?
upon recognizing her condition...... i would have tranquilized her and force fed her.

## to save her life?
absolutely.

## what kept you awake?
doesn't matter.

## what are you talking about?
you're in a spiritual battle, erin.

## how are we on our medical experts?
not good.

## you saying you believe in this stuff?
no.

## validate possession in a court of law?
yes.

## you want me to track her down?
yeah.

## who did she mean by \"they\"?
hey.

## and when did father moore become involved?
our father, who art in heaven...

## emily?
father moore is here.

## can you come downstairs?
as it is in heaven.

## emily, can you hear me?
let's get her off the floor.

## sir, do you often read the bible?
yes, i do.

## what about the dsm?
the diagnostic and statistical...... commonly referred to as the bible of abnormal psychiatry.

## have you read that?
no.

## so you're not aware that according to the dsm...... a person's refusal to eat is a common indication of anorexia?
objection.

## have you ever visited an insane asylum...... or a hospital for the mentally ill?
once.

## so there's a history of mental illness in your family?
i suppose.

## sir, if you saw someone eating insects...... on a street corner, would you say that that person is mentally ill?
probably, yes.

## and you trusted him, right?
yes.

## and after that night, would you say that you...... put your daughter entirely in father moore's care?
yes.

## where did you receive your education?
at yale, and then at cambridge.

## would it be accurate to say that you specialize in the study of possession?
yes.

## why did this possession happen to her?
based on my study of the case file...... i believe that emily rose was a hypersensitive.

## how about silliness, your honor?
a young girl suffered terribly and died.

## do we have to subject her illness to this pseudoscientific analysis?
both counselors, please approach the bench.

## dr. adani, why do you think emily's exorcism failed?
the medical treatment.

## what do you believe was the result of treatment with this intoxicating drug?
gambutrol locked emily in the possessed state.

## have you ever used gambutrol in your studies...... to test your theory about its effect on the possession experience?
absolutely not.

## you're just making this one up?
objection.

## what?
he called us.

## ring a bell?
yes.

## he was there?
yes.

## with all of this medical testimony helping the prosecution...... how could you not tell me that a doctor attended the exorcism?
he asked that i keep his involvement confidential...... and i said i would.

## dr. cartwright?
i recognize you from those courtroom drawings on the news.

## may i sit?
yes, please.

## how do you know him?
well, i was his parishioner at st. vincent's church...... about 15 years ago.

## what kind of help, doctor?
during the exorcism.

## can you help our case?
that girl was not schizophrenic...... and she was not epileptic, or any combination of the two.

## everything you saw?
send me the case files and tell me when to be in court.

## when you saw emily...... did father moore ask you to give her any medical help?
he was already trying to stop her from injuring herself and urging her to eat.

## don't you get it?
he's not just an eyewitness to the exorcism.

## when do i get to testify?
i don't know.

## about dark forces and demonic attacks?
yes, i have.

## what are the chances of that?
i don't know, maybe it was a sign.

## are you wearing the locket now?
no.

## why not?
if the archdiocese wants to avoid embarrassment...... they need you to walk out of here a free man.

## do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, so help you god?
i do.

## father moore, before you could perform the exorcism...... you had to get the sanction of the church, correct?
tell us what happened that night.

## at the hour of...
what happened next?

## what do you make of this gesture, this nod in your direction?
i don't know.

## you're really god's gunslinger, aren't you, father?
standing tall and facing the devil with your prayer book at your side.

## father, did you understand this black robed figure to be the devil?
i believe it was a demonic manifestation.

## like the demonic force you believe possessed emily?
yes.

## why do you think it appeared to you?
i believe the demonic can appear as an apparition...... much like a ghost, in an attempt to excite our fear.

## did it excite your fear, father?
it scared the hell out of me.

## so this night, when you began to prepare emily's exorcism...... was it your first encounter with this demon ghost?
yes.

## have you seen it again?
i've seen it ever since.

## father moore, after you received the bishop's authorization...... when did you proceed with an exorcism?
october 31 st.

## the demons, you mean?
yes.

## father moore...... can you identify this?
it's my tape recorder.

## why would you make such a tape?
i offer into evidence this cassette recorder and audiotape...

## you mean this tape was not given to you by your client?
no, your honor.

## don't ask it any questions...... or pay any attention to what it says.
will you play the tape for us now?

## it\"?
we won't be dealing with emily tonight.

## are you all right?
tell me your name.

## you witnessed this?
some of it, yes.

## did you attempt another exorcism?
i wanted to, but emily refused.

## did you encourage her to eat?
yes, every time i saw her...... but the few times she tried, it seemed like...

## what about medical care?
i wanted her to continue.

## the dual voices we just heard on this tape...... you're certain that they were both coming from emily at the same time?
yes.

## have you tampered with this tape in any way?
no.

## father moore, you consider this tape to be proof of the supernatural?
i think it's a record of certain indications...... that emily was possessed.

## and the vocalization of two distinct voices simultaneously?
yes.

## we'il just have to take your word, won't we?
your honor.

## father, as emily's parish priest...... are you aware that she underwent advanced catechism training?
yes.

## and in that training, did she study ancient greek, hebrew and latin?
yes, i think that's right.

## and according to her high school records...... german was the foreign language she studied there, yes?
i don't know.

## did i miss any?
no.

## but are you aware of the dual sets of vocal cords every human possesses?
no.

## have you heard of...... the superior vocal cords, which are higher than the ones we use to speak?
no.

## but we couldn't see him when you played the tape, correct?
no, of course not.

## so that would be another supernatural aspect of the exorcism...... your tape doesn't prove, correct?
yes.

## do i look like your demon ghost?
your honor.

## does the defense wish to redirect?
no, your honor, but we reserve the right to recall the witness later.

## do we really have to...?
we have absorbed some extraordinary testimony today.

## you can't find him?
i went to meet him, he didn't show.

## what the hell happened?
tell father moore i'm sorry.

## are you drunk?
not yet, but i'm working on it.

## what the hell were you thinking?
karl...

## did you forget the archdiocese is paying for this defense?
the archdiocese isn't on trial.

## like james van hopper?
it's not over.

## what?
he was killed.

## what is this?
yes, your honor.

## when did you last see emily alive?
the night before she died.

## why did she ask to see you?
to give me this.

## did emily explain to you the letter's significance?
yes.

## father moore, was emily a good person?
i believe that one day emily will be recognized as a saint.

## father moore, if emily loved god...... if she was so good and so devout, why do you think god...... allowed this to happen?
objection.

## what is the relevance of that question?
father moore's belief in this matter is crucial...... in establishing his and emily's understanding of her condition.

## your honor, you're not really gonna let someone testify...... about why god would allow the death of a young girl?
the objection has been overruled.

## why did god allow emily to become possessed by demons and then die?
yes.

## and do you believe her?
i believe emily spoke the truth.

## did you see these wounds on both of emily's hands and both feet?
yes.

## and did you attach any supernatural significance to these wounds?
i believe they were stigmata.

## by that, you mean supernatural injuries...... that correspond to the crucifixion wounds of jesus christ?
yes.

## after that night, why do you think emily refused another exorcism?
i believe she'd accepted her fate.

## is there anything else you'd like to say about emily?
no.

## why?
because he sees them as confirmation of what he wants to believe.

## why?
because father richard moore convinced emily...... that she wasn't ill, that she didn't need medicine.

## or are we not alone?
either thought is astonishing.

## do i really believe that this tragedy is the work of the devil?
to be honest, i don't know.

## is it a fact that gambutrol anesthetized emily's brain...... so that the exorcism ritual was rendered ineffective?
i can't be sure of that.

## a world where the spiritual realm really exists?
i can't say that's a fact.

## is it possible?
it's what emily believed.

## i'm simply asking that you believe in father moore.
is father richard moore guilty...... beyond a reasonable doubt, of negligent homicide?

## madam foreman, has the jury reached a verdict?
we have, your honor.

## does the prosecution have any objection to expedited sentencing?
very well.

## father richard moore, do you understand this sentence...... which has been found against you?
yes, your honor.

## that you may, under the law, be sentenced to a term of up to 10 years?
yes, i do.

## are there any statements you wish to make...... before i impose this sentence?
no, your honor.

## have you seen the news?
there's our priest, leaving the courthouse a free man...... right next to you.

## will you be able to return to your parish?
i can't go back.

## what about you?
i believe you've seen the darkness too.

## who chose the epitaph?
i did.

## was it a deliberate choice never to show the jaguar shark?
no.

## yes, what's next for team zissou?
well, that was only part one.

## you don't know what it is?
thank you.

## what would be the scientific purpose of killing it?
revenge.

## you think it went okay?
no, congratulations.

## does larry have that kind of spending bread to invest?
the king's backing him now.

## where?
make it quick.

## leopard... fish?
jaguar shark.

## does it actually exist?
you know, allie, i don't wanna give away the ending.

## is that a new merit badge?
as a matter of fact, it is.

## how could you lay that slick faggot?
well, i was in love with him at the time.

## how are you feeling?
i'm right on the edge.

## do we really wanna put me through this?
people say eleanor is the brains behind team zissou.

## what is steve?
he's the zissou.

## how you doing, werner?
he brought you a present.

## how's this?
steve, there's a bloke over there wants a word with you.

## how many of these do you have?
all right, look, just forge the rest of em yourself.

## why would i do that, my darling?
to call his bluff, damn it.

## how is she?
she died last month.

## do you?
no, i don't.

## you're supposed to be my son, right?
i don't know.

## so do be nice to this girl, miss winslett richardson, won't you?
apparently she worships you... and we dearly need the press.

## so, what do you do?
i'm a pilot.

## wanna kill this?
frankly, i'd better not.

## what happened to jacqueline?
she didn't really love me.

## ned?
no, not the ned part.

## what are you doing?
i ordered the wine.

## eh?
people say when someone says something like that about you... it's because they're jealous.

## how did she die, by the way, your mother?
she took her own life.

## why would she do that?
well, she was in a great deal of pain, you know.

## thursday?
okay.

## which one?
marmalade.

## what happened?
a rattlesnake bit it in the throat.

## you couldn't try to break it a little bit nicer?
she's a rich bitch, you know.

## who gives a shit?
i think it was a tabby.

## ned, wanna come inside, we'il make up a room for you?
steve, that reporter called.

## yes?
i'm on the echo box.

## the white button?
okay.

## is there a chemical inside the organism?
no, ned.

## would you like to join my crew?
would i like to...

## why not?
well, it's not my field.

## don't you get it?
steve, i'm not even that strong a swimmer.
