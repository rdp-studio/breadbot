he's been beaten and tortured all his life.

## the man's not all bad, is he?
tell me that this material would not make a fantastic moving picture.

## seven reels?
seven reels.

## who in their right minds... is gonna wanna sit through a movie that runs for over an hour?

new wardrobe.

## civil war surplus?
yeah, aitken got a good deal on it.

## you don't think these guys are gonna mind?
dressing up like the losing side.

## how do i look?
you're weary, general.

## can you give me a sigh, general?
beautiful.

## is there anything the man cannot do?
it is easy to be president in a movie.

## surely not retire?
i think the government would open a factory to make good saddles at frago.

## and you would settle for just doing that?
that and watch that mexico does not become... another star on the flag of your country.

## what pancho villa wants... for himself?
a parade when he dies.

the battle of torren.

i'm not sure.

## will you take this?
too bad them actresses don't do no jazzing.

## general, these boys have been such a help to the movie... and now you're turning them into soldiers?
you can't.

## schools for only some, harvard just for yours, death for the rest?
one boy for you, one boy for villa.

## how can anyone possibly make that choice?
that one for you.

## you're attacking from here.
all right, got your cameras?

## your camera's going to shoot into the sun, huh?
your lenses are not strong enough.

## could you change your attack so that you fire from the west... instead of the east?
that would give us so much better a picture.

## what's this?
by day we can win the battle, by night we will win the war.

## you never really intended to honor our contract, did you?
my only contract is honored with mexico.

## what the hell was in there?
this way they go to heaven faster.

## as if it's gonna bother somebody in the next grave, right?
i can't tell you how happy this is going to make my mother.

## how could you?
don't speak to me of god.

## why did he kill her, jack?
so coldly, so brutally.

## you don't still work for him, do you?
no, not since after the revolution.

## and the orphans, remember?
aitken was mad he broke the contract.

## you want my two cents, for what they're worth?
mexico would be a hell of a lot better off... if god had taken his goddamn oil and shoved it under brooklyn.

## how will the sons of mexico remember our pancho villa?
following his assassination, the name of pancho villa... was stricken from all official records, statues, monuments, even children's books.

yeah.

## avec gas?
merci.

yes, i did.

## could we be serious andjust talk about the painting for a minute?
the painting belongs to roxy because she cared enough about it to take it with her.

## right, margeeve?
i don't think we should sell it.

## why, because it's worth more money than you thought?
well, that is a consideration.

## how do we get around roxy's husband?
even if he claims one half of roxy's share...

just kidding.

they overlook the most amazing vintages.

## huh?
appropriate.

## i mean, you're hardly going to tell the seller he has a renoir, are you?
the price would go out of sight.

## and what do you think?
i think your very fine la tour would... in a competitive bidding, achieve a very fine price.

## what kind of price range are we talking?
perhaps a million pounds.

## really?
a million, dad.

## tou mean, personality wise?
no, i think i mean character wise.

## where do these pretty things come from?
usually we beg in front of dior or st. laurent... so that rich women on shopping sprees can expiate their sins.

i don't think we need it in tulsa.

## what can i do?
this conference was fixed up long ago.

sweetie, just for tonight, have fun, stop dissecting and take part.

## you saying we're natives in some tribe?
anthropologically speaking, we're all members of tribes.

## what?
after the cartesian split he 17th century, we separated our minds from our bodies, the numinous from the animalistic.

## are you calling me an animal, fool?
no fool, shes using the cart foilosophy to say she's down with the music.

## now, who are you calling a fool, fool?
get out of my way.

## are you sure she can handle this?
no one in our lab knows the first thing about dealing with a mummy.

## are you two high?
only by accident, so it doesn't count.

## why did you bring tessa?
this doesn't seem like such a great date.

## who the hell wants to know?
i'm sorry.

## why?
why he had them.

## any idea?
the guy barely looks human.

## bones... how did something like this happen?
let's just say your boss inhaled.

## i'm going to make it up to you, i promise. okay?
ice cream later.

## can we just stick to the business here?
thank you.

## im gonna need a list of your employees, all right?
we'll find out run them through the system, see if any one of them have a drug conviction.

## how long before you can id him?
well im not all tired, so i'm sure i can stay up all night and work.

## chamomile tea?
it's very soothing.

## are you sure you need me here?
payback for showing me the good life.

## the meth found in his lungs and nasal passages matches the meth that juiced angela and the good doctor here.
ok, so how is my man, the tut?

## can you please keep it clinical?
so, uh, he died of, uh, an overdose.

## so, uh, he, uh, overdosed with his meth behind the wall?
judging from the acarid mites in his ears, i'd say six weeks.

## hey, didn't he have hands?
they're easier to work with dismembered.

## off that?
sure.

## you ever been to costa rica?
the aztecs would flay people and then wear their skin as a bodysuit.

## did the fbi find a match?
yup.

## roy taylor?
you're kidding.

## does this make your head explode?
i grabbed a couple hours sleep on my couch and showered in the lab's decontamination room.

## do you even know who you're talking about?
yeah, i've done my googling.

## you didn't know who he was hanging with or who might have been chasing him?
dude like mount, he had a lot of enemies other artists, rivalries.

## what rules?
ask rulz.

## was it fun coming to the club?
yeah, before the drugs and the dead body.

## really?
footprints.

## one last look?
take them in, show them around.

## agent booth?
yeah.

## you're the one looking into my son's murder?
investigating his death, yes, sir.

## about your son's death?
no, sir.

## do you understand me, sir?
mr. taylor...

## do you understand, sir?
a personal relationship with jesus.

## you know that word, agent booth?
it's from the bible.

## i can trust that you will find out what happened to my boy?
yes, sir.

## can we conform to as much forensic protocol as possible?
we're better at this than you think.

## you know what those are?
rats. intensive scare of rats eat the laces right out of our boots.

## can i retrieve?
yes.

## did you talk to him?
oh, no.

## zirconium or diamond?
i'm more focused on the dried blood and flesh at the moment.

## you buy tessa jewelry?
i...

## too much of a commitment?
i just thought because, you two were going away.

## i was able to pull some particulates.
do you have anything yet?

## eyeballs?
yeah.

## polyethylene?
came from the plastic bag holding the meth.

## why don't you get her a belly button ring?
i'm a forensic anthropologist at the jeffersonian.

## so?
so, murder is wacked.

## and, uh... what happens when they do?
i take a piece of them.

## what is her sorry ass name?
eve warren.

## what was she doing with mount?
take a guess.

## she kept your ring?
it's a diamond, man.

## any idea where she is now?
probably ripping somebody else off.

## what happened to your hand?
i got shot through the wrist a few years ago.

## you want to see the scars?
thanks anyway.

## bones?
i like this music.

## what?
it's reasonable.

## see what i mean?
i think you should find a nice, relaxing place to go on that vacation.

## why exactly are we talking aut this?
because you're tense.

## roy taylor?
yes.

## anything pop out at you now that the bones are clean?
there's some damage to the facet joint and foramen on c 4 on the right side of the neck.

## slight indentation?
could be congenital or a bone anomaly.

## do you ever go on vacation?
i take my vacation when you take your vacation.

## what do you do?
go back home to michigan.

## do you enjoy that?
god, no.

## then why do you go?
it's my family.

## what do you want?
special agent booth, fbl.

## what you call this?
the krump.

## so what do you want?
you didn't come here for a dance lesson.

## how you doing, baby?
come on now.

## we're going to go outside and gonna play with the rest of the kids, okay?
there you go.

## when was the last time you saw her?
about six weeks ago when she dropped off maya.

## just dropped her off and left?
told me she needed me to watch her for a couple days.

## she's like a daughter to me, too.
did you, um, happen to have a, i don't know, recent photo that we could take?

## i mean, didn't you go look for her?
i learned to let her go.

## do you know roy taylor?
met him.

## you can't find evie?
no.

## how about this, huh?
dj mount rejects eve because of her questionable past.

## what?
yeah, i don't really think much about that kind of stuff.

## look up from your microscope, huh?
these are real people we're trying to figure out here.

## yeah?
yeah.

## real question is, where does she go next?
you're on fire, man.

## you know what?
i'm gonna turn you into an investigator yet.

## and that's based on...?
money and meth.

## only question is, why wasn't he facing her?
it got thigh back there.

## what?
that just... makes me a little sick.

## you pick dead bodies out of mass graves, and yanking out a belly button ring makes you sick?
okay, okay, moving on.

## why the hell you pick me up, man?
i think you know why i brought you in.

## metro cop?
i'm special agent ronald oakes.

## one of us?
my orders were not to break deep cover for anybody.

## got any keys for these cuffs?
fine.

## you ran him, right?
yeah.

## came back clean?
exactly.

## what about this murder?
the night that dj mount disappeared, hall got ripped of for a mountain of meth and a ton of cash.

## dj mount ripped of all?
nah, doesn't scan.

## so listen, anybody asks... why'd you have me arrested?
weapons beef.

## why do you think they never got me on anything?
because terence baskin is my past.

## where did you find her?
museum.

## lead to murder?
sure, they were both capable.

## yeah?
rulz built himself a studio around that time.

## what do you think?
oh, i think, uh, i think we need to find a way to find a body buried under a slab of cement.

## well, can't you get a warrant?
to look around the premises, maybe, but no way to tear it up.

## what, i'm gonna hurt her... his feelings?
tutti is the best cadaver dog in the world, agent booth.

## i mean, so what?
he drools a little.

## what's up with that?
you know, your eyes are kind of close together, but i don't comment.

## is he sincere?
yeah.

## where did booth go?
i got to give him the news.

## we've already got cause of death and identity what am i looking for?
it might be grasping but that odd mark we found on mount's skull, see if you can find anything like it on eve's remains.

## jamaica?
god, that's incredible.

## what do you mean?
you have keys to each other's places.

## living together?
silly.

## uh, cause of death?
same as mount.

## zygo zu...?
you said she was killed by crystal meth.

## rulz couldn't have smashed her into a wall?
her radius was separated from the scaphoid and trapezium.

## this is a weird kind of interrogation, huh?
cops telling me what i didn't do.

## what you think, i'm some type of idiot?
well, do me a favor, deny it.

## why?
because every time some raper gets murdered, his business goes straight through the roof.

## why should dj mount get the bump, huh?
maybe it's my turn.

## for how long?
sweeten the pot, i'll charge you with mount's death, too.

## what have you got?
look, i can tell y'all.

## we have to figure it out just from motive?
okay, look, bones, this is, you know, sort of my thing.

## where did you find her?
the museum.

## you're saying that dj mount was going to leave bassment records?
all he needed was the money to buy himself back.

## but what about eve?
eve couldn't kill nobody.

## hey, how about this?
hall's got motive to kill mount.

## why?
because he's jumping labels and he's running away with some girl who's stealing mount's meth and money.

## for what?
i mean, it feels real to me... i mean, eve is a woman in love, whs trying to escape a world that's just crushing her.

## what the hell is that?
not sure.

## you know what?
i'm going to spread the pain.

## okay?
that's my new motto.

## what?
killed mount in that wall so that he wouldn't leave your label.

## did he just poke me with his little stick?
this is my place.

## hey, booth?
don't break the cane.

## arrest him for what?
he's the guy who pointed a gun at a federal agent.

## what happened?
well, she said something came up at work, but i know the truth.

## how many times do you want me to poke zack?
just once, but as hard as you can.

## why don't i hit him as haras i can?
because you have arms like noodles, while i am vigorous and burly.

## that all you got, burly boy?
they got freaked out by stage six.

## let them confirm the match.
what... what is stage six?

## what, and let them have all the glory?
my chest hurts.

## getting yourself in the mood?
trying.

## oh?
tessa's not going.

## really?
sure, nothing wrong with being alone.

## no, i mean, you like to go on vacation?
yeah, i go places all the time.

## got away from what?
i think about not coming back.

## seriously?
yeah, you know, you go with someone, you joke about not going back to your real life..

## who just threw that?
oh shit, mr. duncan.

## you know this dude?
i ran into an old student, i got held up.

## mm hmm, did you get the present?
yeah, yeah, voil.

## you made me laugh.
ready?

## so dorset prep, where is that exactly?
yeah i know, i'm breaking every rule.

## hello, is steggie in here?
beware.

## why not?
he's an herbivore.

## good birthday?
yeah.

## what was your favorite present?
my jacket...

## what's on your agenda tomorrow?
uh, i have to stop by the gallery.

## you do realize it'd mean moving, right?
so, we'd move.

## a ding dong...
yeah?

## a ding dong...
like you?

## yeah?
uh...

## kaboom!
yeah.

## do you want this?
yeah.

## and how would you like to pay for this?
a credit card, please.

## ma'am?
i'm sorry, i got stuck at a teacher's conference.

## jessie?
you have four new messages.

## yeah?
it's richard, richard wells.

## richard?
your wife was an undergraduate student of mine.

## actually, do you have a minute?
i'm sorry, i know this is a terrible time.

## help us?
i'm a doctor.

## what is it you do, paul?
i teach biology.

## can you tell us what this is about?
yeah.

## this would be the identical boy down to the last chromosome on the last hair of his head.
do you mean cloned?

## this is how you wanna help us?
i used to be affiliated with a hospital here and i had a chance to review jessie's records.

## paul, please.
you did what?

## you come at me with this?
god knows what hell you've been through.

## you've successfully cloned a human being?
no, i haven't but only because i've been looking for an ideal candidate.

## what are you proposing here?
he's not even sure that he can...

## any idea how much could go wrong?
honey, i... listen, i love you, i love you.

## i love you beyond words, okay?
but only the tiniest thing has to go wrong and so much has to go right.

## but what if it did?
it still wouldn't be adam.

## you know what i kept thinking while i was waiting for paramedics... and he was in my arms... and i was watching him die?
yeah, i will.

## sure i've heard of him.
hey, sam, can i... can i ask you something?

## why do you ask?
he was an old teacher of jessie's.

## really?
no, i think we should call it adam.

## she has to lie down for at least an hour, so why don't we go look at the house and i'll show you around?
she's in good hands.

## so, all these people and no one else knows?
the procedure doesn't differ much from a standard implant.

## dr. wells?
thanks, george.

## so why don't you follow me?
i'll show you around.

## what if the implant doesn't take, the procedure's a bust... what then?
it'll work, paul.

## but if i can speak plainly, what more do you have to lose?
her.

## is this for real?
for now.

## what is that?
oh my god, paul.

## how are you feeling?
i'm back.

## oh, baby, thank god.
what's wrong?

## this is the same as last time, remember?
it's him.

## you wanted to give us a scare, didn't you?
it's good... nice kids, bright too.

## you don't still miss your old school?
no, it's more like i miss missing it.

## keep it away from the trees.
uncle richard, want to help me fly it?

## but i thought god made everything.
so what was this word you said?

## how many times i gotta tell you, you can't leave your toys around?
somebody's gonna trip and...

## where did you get this?
it was a birthday present from joey smoyer.

## why don't you get some sleep?
dad, i've been thinking...

## about what?
i don't think i like you so much anymore.

## where do you think you're going?
but he's still his own person entirely.

## i honestly forget sometimes, you know?
and then something like that... that toy dinosaur thing will happen.

## what?
if he ever found out.

## what if he did?
i don't know, he just collapsed.

## night terrors?
it's a sleep disorder.

## what's happening here, richard?
that's what i'd like to find out.

## let's just give it a little time, okay?
yeah.

## but no, no, no... is he all right?
he's fine.

## come on, come on.
you okay?

## adam?
i'm talking to you.

## adam?
hey, i'm talking to you.

## did you hear me calling you?
your dinner is ready.

## i don't think it's anything to worry about, okay?
all right, take care and i'll see you soon.

## you sure you're okay?
yeah.

## you sure?
yeah.

## anybody know what this is?
it's a big ugly visual aide.

## so what, the gene isn't present?
no, no, it's present, it's just inactive.

## why don't you just take a look at chapter 11 for the rest of the period and then, you know, go?
i'm going to put on a little show for you guys and you're going to pay me your lunch money.

## how about this?
you're a tiny little boy.

## if there's anything he isn't, it's common.
what if his having outlived the life of that first original cell has somehow allowed some dormant problem to be switched on?

## you don't think i'm just as concerned?
no.

## ever want to have any children of your own, richard?
jessie's always saying how great you are with adam.

## where did you learn that language?
i don't know.

## are you all right?
i'm fine.

## do you?
yeah, i would, actually.

## dr. lieber?
okay.

## in beauford?
great.

## who's that?
adam, open the door.

## what?
how... the curtain.

## what?
the curtain.

## what are you talking about?
look, it's fine.

## huh?
i saw it.

## what did you see?
adam, talk to me.

## what is it?
something bad is going to happen.

## huh?
say it.

## so, how many eggs did you retrieve?
i only retrieved three.

## what's the matter?
you look...

## oh, what's that for?
nasty monkey.

## so what you're saying, these nightmares might have started at this age anyway?
or possibly triggered by any number of things... school, stress, tension at home.

## retained memories of his first life?
no, no.

## he's never felt as comfortable here as you, has he?
no.

## you don't think he'd ever try to leave, do you?
jessie, that can't happen.

## i can trust you to rein paul in?
yes.

## apparently, they couldn't reach you?
i was out.

## how's adam?
he's fine, mrs. duncan.

## is that wine on your breath?
i was having lunch.

## god, paul.
with who?

## wait, where are we going?
to get a second opinion.

## about these night terrors... you're confident that's what this is?
i don't know.

## honey, who is zachary?
he's the boy who lives in my dreams.

## this boy told you his name was zachary?
not really, i kind of just know.

## and you've never seen his face?
he doesn't like to show it, but i know because of his jacket.

## what kind of jacket?
zachary.

## and where are you?
where we live.

## richard?
listen, there's something he's not telling us, jessie, i know it.

## zachary, zachary, where are you?
tell me about zachary.

## what are you trying to tell us, adam?
say it.

## if you don't understand it, how do you expect to beat it?
he's okay.

## dad... did i die?
of course not.

## in the city?
jesus, it's possible.

## how can you say that?
because he can't.

## okay now, i want outside your houses in the pictures, okay?
take your time.

## what would that entail?
well, for starters, i'd like you to bring him in again.

## please don't touch this.
i'll talk to him, okay?

## are you hungry?
hi, mom.

## adam, roy's mother says he hasn't come home from school yet.
you hungry?

## do you know where he might be?
no.

## what were you doing down at the river this afternoon?
just playing.

## with who?
i'm not supposed to say.

## adam, can you answer me?
go to your room.

## can you tell me the name of the school?
pius...

## are you sure this can't hurt him?
it's a mild tranquilizer.

## right paul?
yeah.

## in school?
they all are.

## are you sure you wanna do this?
z zachary.

## who are you?
richard, release him.

## adam?
wake up.

## daddy?
answer me, richard.

## why?
paul, you've gone completely...

## there have been times i've seen you talking to him and he's in that same blank state, but he listens to you, doesn't he, huh?
don't push me, richard.

## you understand i'll go public?
i'm not kidding.

## now?
i told you.

## what?
it doesn't mean...

## you're not?
i'm not sure of anything right now.

## you wish we'd never done this?
good night, baby.

## are you sure this is the only saint pius?
well, it's the only one in this city.

## what about past student records, like a search by name?
i'm looking for a zachary clark.

## a few weeks?
hi.

## yes?
melinda.

## great, thank you.
so, it was just vacant?

## cora williams?
there had been incidents at school.

## zachary didn't say a word about what i'd done.
the fire at saint pius?

## that's where they found his body.
are you here?

## where was his father?
oh, he was at the hospital like always.

## you shouldn't have touched that box.
the hospital, he was a doctor?

## is this me?
honey, don't be scared.

## what was that?
adam can't come out to play right now, mrs. duncan.

## you couldn't use him, could you?
zachary.

## but the fire destroyed him, right?
you didn't even have a viable cell.

## i'm right, aren't i?
except for one thing.

## to my family?
i'd think you of all people would understand, seeing as we were both after the same thing.

## what you did goes way beyond...
is there, paul?

## societal standards?
you name me a single medical advancement that didn't.

## if i'm not supposed to do this, paul, then how is it that i can?
because you're a scientist.

## have you trespassed?
i don't know.

## no, this is over, you understand?
we're gonna go to the police, and then we're gonna find someplace, anyplace that can help him.

## terminate?
let go.

## who are you right now?
i'm your son.

## how are you doing?
it's not finished yet.

## but those doctors you've been working with, they all say this change could be really good for you, right?
sweetie, you've been doing so great.

## hey, kiddo, i thought you were...
yeah?

## i thought you were coming down.
adam?

## are you all right?
you'd tell me if there was anything...

## who just threw that?
give me that cake.

## maurice?
oh shit, mr. duncan.

## you know this dude?
i had maurice in my ninth grade bio class about five years ago.

## paul, what took you so long?
i ran into an old student, i got held up.

## mm hmm, did you get the present?
yeah, yeah, voila.

## you made me laugh.
ready?

## so dorset prep, where is that exactly?
yeah i know, i'm breaking every rule.

## hello, is steggie in here?
beware.

## why not?
he's an herbivore.

## good birthday?
yeah.

## what was your favorite present?
my jacket...

## what's on your agenda tomorrow?
uh, i have to stop by the gallery.

## you do realize it'd mean moving, right?
so, we'd move.

## a ding dong...
yeah?

## a ding dong...
like you?

## yeah?
uh...

## kaboom!
yeah.

## do you want this?
yeah.

## and how would you like to pay for this?
a credit card, please.

## ma'am?
i'm sorry, i got stuck at a teacher's conference.

## jessie?
you have four new messages.

## yeah?
it's richard, richard wells.

## richard?
your wife was an undergraduate student of mine.

## actually, do you have a minute?
i'm sorry, i know this is a terrible time.

## help us?
i'm a doctor.

## what is it you do, paul?
i teach biology.

## can you tell us what this is about?
yeah.

## do you mean cloned?
yes.

## this is how you wanna help us?
i used to be affiliated with a hospital here and i had a chance to review jessie's records.

## you did what?
i'm aware of the complications surrounding adam's delivery, that it's impossible for you to conceive again.

## you looked at her records?
i had to be certain that jessie's condition didn't preclude carrying a child and it doesn't, so yes, i can help you.

## you come at me with this?
god knows what hell you've been through.

## you've successfully cloned a human being?
no, i haven't but only because i've been looking for an ideal candidate.

## what are you proposing here?
he's not even sure that he can...

## any idea how much could go wrong?
honey, i... listen, i love you, i love you.

## i love you beyond words, okay?
but only the tiniest thing has to go wrong and so much has to go right.

## but what if it did?
it still wouldn't be adam.

## you know what i kept thinking while i was waiting for paramedics... and he was in my arms... and i was watching him die?
this is the last time i'll ever get to hold him.

## um... so... how's jessie taking all this?
actually, she's... she's not so well.

## look, would you please just pass on my condolences to her?
yeah, i will.

## have you ever heard of a doctor named richard wells?
richard wells.

## why do you ask?
he was an old teacher of jessie's.

## really?
three, two, one.

## do you think that's a good idea?
no, i think we should call it adam.

## guess who?
i don't know.

## are we all in?
damn, what a handsome group.

## she has to lie down for at least an hour, so why don't we go look at the house and i'll show you around?
she's in good hands.

## so, all these people and no one else knows?
the procedure doesn't differ much from a standard implant.

## dr. wells?
thanks, george.

## so why don't you follow me?
i'll show you around.

## beautiful country, isn't it?
this whole area has a lot of history.

## what if the implant doesn't take, the procedure's a bust... what then?
it'll work, paul.

## but if i can speak plainly, what more do you have to lose?
her.

## is this for real?
for now.

## what is that?
oh my god, paul.

## how are you feeling?
i'm back.

## okay, how long?
30 seconds, 31, 32... 33, 34, 35...

## what's wrong?
40 seconds, 41...

## this is the same as last time, remember?
it's him.

## you wanted to give us a scare, didn't you?
it's good... nice kids, bright too.

## you don't still miss your old school?
no, it's more like i miss missing it.

## uncle richard, want to help me fly it?
let's get it up there.

## so what was this word you said?
reeservoier.

## well, in a way he did, if you believe he created those people who figured out how to make a reservoir, right?
somebody's gonna trip and...

## where did you get this?
it was a birthday present from joey smoyer.

## do you like it?
yeah.

## why don't you get some sleep?
dad, i've been thinking...

## about what?
i don't think i like you so much anymore.

## where do you think you're going?
but he's still his own person entirely.

## i honestly forget sometimes, you know?
and then something like that... that toy dinosaur thing will happen.

## what?
if he ever found out.

## what if he did?
about what it would mean to him.

## what happened?
i don't know, he just collapsed.

## night terrors?
it's a sleep disorder.

## what's happening here, richard?
that's what i'd like to find out.

## let's just give it a little time, okay?
yeah.

## but no, no, no... is he all right?
he's fine.

## come on, come on.
you okay?

## adam?
there you are.

## hey... are you all right?
i'm talking to you.

## adam?
hey, i'm talking to you.

## did you hear me calling you?
your dinner is ready.

## i don't think it's anything to worry about, okay?
all right, take care and i'll see you soon.

## you sure you're okay?
yeah.

## you sure?
yeah.

## anybody know what this is?
it's a big ugly visual aide.

## so what, the gene isn't present?
no, no, it's present, it's just inactive.

## why don't you just take a look at chapter 11 for the rest of the period and then, you know, go?
i'm going to put on a little show for you guys and you're going to pay me your lunch money.

## how about this?
you're a tiny little boy.

## if there's anything he isn't, it's common.
what if his having outlived the life of that first original cell has somehow allowed some dormant problem to be switched on?

## you don't think i'm just as concerned?
no.

## ever want to have any children of your own, richard?
jessie's always saying how great you are with adam.

## where did you learn that language?
i don't know.

## are you all right?
i'm fine.

## do you?
how many times do i got to tell you...

## you okay, honey?
yes.

## hello?
yeah, i would, actually.

## dr. lieber?
okay.

## in beauford?
great.

## who's that?
open the door.

## what?
how... the curtain.

## what?
the curtain.

## what are you talking about?
look, it's fine.

## huh?
i saw it.

## what did you see?
adam, talk to me.

## what is it?
something bad is going to happen.

## huh?
say it.

## so, how many eggs did you retrieve?
i only retrieved three.

## what's the matter?
you look...

## hey, hey, how would you like that?
i just got an idea.

## come on, you chicken.
how about we have a swinging contest?

## oh, what's that for?
nasty monkey.

## so what you're saying, these nightmares might have started at this age anyway?
or possibly triggered by any number of things... school, stress, tension at home.

## retained memories of his first life?
there's an often cited experiment... a rat was trained to run a maze, killed, then ground up and fed to a second rat.

## so, it's not possible he's remembering?
no, no.

## he's never felt as comfortable here as you, has he?
no.

## you don't think he'd ever try to leave, do you?
jessie, that can't happen.

## i can trust you to rein paul in?
yes.

## apparently, they couldn't reach you?
i was out.

## how's adam?
he's fine, mrs. duncan.

## is that wine on your breath?
i was having lunch.

## why are you so upset?
it was just lunch.

## wait, where are we going?
to get a second opinion.

## about these night terrors... you're confident that's what this is?
i see it in a number of kids adam's age.

## who?
i don't know.

## honey, who is zachary?
he's the boy who lives in my dreams.

## this boy told you his name was zachary?
not really, i kind of just know.

## and you've never seen his face?
he doesn't like to show it, but i know because of his jacket.

## what kind of jacket?
just let him answer.

## adam?
zachary.

## and where are you?
where we live.

## richard?
listen, there's something he's not telling us, jessie, i know it.

## zachary, zachary, where are you?
tell me about zachary.

## what are you trying to tell us, adam?
say it.

## if you don't understand it, how do you expect to beat it?
he's okay.

## dad... did i die?
of course not.

## in the city?
jesus, it's possible.

## how can you say that?
because he can't.

## okay now, i want to see everyone in your family outside your houses in the pictures, okay?
take your time.

## what would that entail?
well, for starters, i'd like you to bring him in again.

## i'll talk to him, okay?
oh, no.

## are you hungry?
hi, mom.

## hello?
no, i'm sorry, tanya, he isn't.

## do you know where he might be?
no.

## what were you doing down at the river this afternoon?
just playing.

## with who?
i'm not supposed to say.

## adam, can you answer me?
go to your room.

## can you tell me the name of the school?
pius...

## are you sure this can't hurt him?
it's a mild tranquilizer.

## right paul?
yeah.

## in school?
they all are.

## are you sure you wanna do this?
z zachary.

## who is zachary clark?
they think i'm him.

## who are you?
richard, release him.

## adam?
wake up.

## adam, wake up.
adam?

## daddy?
yeah.

## hey, why'd you call him zachary?
answer me, richard.

## why?
paul, you've gone completely...

## there have been times i've seen you talking to him and he's in that same blank state, but he listens to you, doesn't he, huh?
don't push me, richard.

## you understand i'll go public?
i'm not kidding.

## now?
i told you.

## what?
it doesn't mean...

## you're not?
i'm not sure of anything right now.

## you wish we'd never done this?
good night, baby.

## are you sure this is the only saint pius?
well, it's the only one in this city.

## what about past student records, like a search by name?
i'm looking for a zachary clark.

## a few weeks?
hi.

## yes?
sorry to bother you.

## does that name mean anything to you?
he's a young child, a boy.

## did they have any children?
melinda.

## so, it was just vacant?
well, for a few years, yeah.

## cora williams?
you don't know me, but i need to talk to you.

## what did he do?
there had been incidents at school.

## the fire at saint pius?
they never found out how the fire got started, but i knew.

## zachary didn't say a word about what i'd done.
adam?

## are you here?
i was at home the next day, when i was struck by the most awful premonition.

## adam?
so she went down the stairs to the basement, to check on the water heater.

## are you down there?
and that's where he was... just waiting for her.

## where was his father?
oh, he was at the hospital like always.

## the hospital, he was a doctor?
pick it up if you're there, please.

## adam?
honey, you shouldn't have opened that.

## is this me?
honey, let me explain.

## a funeral where?
honey, don't be scared.

## what was that?
honey...

## adam?
adam can't come out to play right now, mrs. duncan.

## you couldn't use him, could you?
zachary.

## but the fire destroyed him, right?
you didn't even have a viable cell.

## i'm right, aren't i?
except for one thing.

## to my family?
i'd think you of all people would understand, seeing as we were both after the same thing.

## what you did goes way beyond...

## what are you doing?
preparing a briefing for agent scott.

## agent scott?
i don't understand why he needs someone else.

## she here yet?
she was on the flight.

## she's going to be advising, right?

## special agent scott?
yes.

## what?
i think it was premeditated.

## the corners?
they're neat.

## your victim 5 1 0?
yes, exactly.

## that's a bicycle path, right?
on the photos you sent...... the victim had these slight indentations on his ankles.

## his eyes, we think they were removed, or are they still in his skull?
we don't know.

## are we done here?
yeah.

## same m. o.?
same everything.

## why not?
he was interrupted.

## what about the blood on you?
you try to help somebody who's bleeding to death...

## so i shouted what did you shout?
something dumb like that.

## oh, the thing around his neck?
yeah, i kind of had to.

## did you see where the attacker went?
yeah, he went far from me.

## what kind of gun did he have?
he had the kind that puts really big holes in people.

## and i can draw a little bit, all right?
so...... maybe if you would give me a piece of paper, i can sketch him for you.

## you mind if i give it a try?
no, please go ahead.

## you another cop?
in a way, yes.

## special agent?
i'm fbl.

he had extremely bright eyes.

## burning, you know?
even in the dark.

## did he seem agitated or in control?
oh, jesus.

## am i right?
yes, yes.

## he died, okay?
he died.

## okay?
i saw him, and i can show you what he looks like.

## what do you think?
yeah, pattern marks on morin's neck show the killer's left handed.

## i think we need a little more than that, no?
i know.

## you learn a lot of that stuff at the fbl, don't you?
i mean, all those theories, all those books.

## could i talk to you for a second?
excuse me.

## can i talk to you?
you haven't slept yet.

## do you think it was staged?
no.

## i mean, why?
he's not taunting us.

yeah, that's him.

## you know what?
we need that phone bill.

## you guys gonna pay it?

## why?
let's not reward the killer with coverage.

## so this isn't a coincidence, right?
no.

## does that bother you?
i've been looking over my shoulder since this whole thing happened, so no.

## how are you doing?
i can't sleep.

## did you get any responses to the sketch?
maybe.

## that night, do you remember clive morin fighting back?

## how long does it take here to dig up a body?
the left radius, falling off a chair or something.

## how'd she talk you into putting her here?
mrs. asher has a way with words.

## well, what about a headstrong fbl agent who's just not familiar with the rules?
now, that's a different story.

## you okay?
i'm fine.

## are you sure?
illeana, leclair knows you were at the house.

## would you come to the office about an hour early tomorrow?
sure.

## nothing else?
the alarm system was cut.

## remember making love with those pictures of the dead people around us?
let's face it, illeana...... an ordinary person does not love that as much as we did.

## everything just keeps going my way, you know?
bye bye.

## where is he?
a hit.

## see you.
help!

## you be careful, huh?
i will.

## you were making some tea?
all right, let me make you a cup.

## you looking for this?
now, you see, that's got me very confused, illeana.

## you feeling scared?
i followed all that business down there in washington...... which, i thought...... was completely bogus, by the way.

## you left a few footprints, though, didn't you?
i thought you were pretty easy to find.

## twins?
i like going into their room.

## what is it?
i don't want to.

## why would you say something like that?
take it back.

## whose babies are they?
yours.

right.

that's a good question.

## no need to be sorry, all right?

## why'd you call time out?
uh...

## calvin cambridge is calling for a bathroom break?
i guess when you gotta go, reggie, you gotta go.

## and no wonder, after he led them to a come from behind win over the spurs with 27 points?
that kid was unbelievable.

## did i just see the admiral saluting him at the end of the game?
you know, cambridge's contract makes him the youngest, and the shortest person ever to sign a deal with the nba.

## hey, what about me?
bittleman.

## forbids it?
oh, yeah.

## didn't i tell you?
uh, i signed your contract as your guardian, so, um, as long as you're playing for the knights, that can't change.

## what?
relax.

## you are familiar with the nba mentoring program, are you not?
oh, no.

## you know why?
uh, my boy murph says i snore.

## who are all those people?
parents, here to see you.

## i mean, that's a good thing, right?
good for you.

## what do you think?
i don't know.

## and you believe bittleman?
his contract says nothing about adoption.

## look, why would you send all of these people here?
calvin deserves a home.

## yes, what is it, calvin?
you lied to me.

## what are you talking about?
you told me no one can adopt me.

## what do you think about that, my big man?
you're best off here... with me.

## hello?
it's me, calvin.

## you're here?
yeah, i'm here, and it took me 4 busses to get here, too.

## calvin, what are you doing here?
hey, i just can't wait to see the inside.

## why you here?
i wanna check your place out.

## what do you call this game?
i have no idea.

## so you're not gonna tell me why you're here?
it's just a question of time, so you gotta have a little faith.

## all right?
but in the meantime...

## right now?
right now, yes.

## you have your geometry work with you?
yeah.

## do i know about geometry?
take take your time on that call, and, um, meet me outside.

## so you still haven't met any parents you liked?
i don't know.

## what right person?
tracy.

## yeah, so?
that doesn't mean he wants to adopt me.

## well, why don't you ask him?

## i mean, how can you have a dad and not talk to him?
man, that's nuts.

## you're back again?
yeah, uh, i got a surprise for you.

## calvin, why'd you bring him here?

## now you have to beat the raptors or we're out, you got that?
we're gonna have to tighten it up, guys.

## what's wrong?
i give up on ever finding somebody to adopt me.

## what's the matter?
you've had something on your mind all night.

## it's calvin, isn't it?
as we hit the end of the regular season, the big story is this weekend's showdown between the los angeles knights and the toronto raptors.

## hey, man.
besides, what does a little kid know about the play offs?

## how you doing?

## excuse me, uh, mr. williams?
it's possible.

## who's nister?
you know, the guy with the ear.

## what can i do for you, mr. bittleman?
i'm looking for a, uh, sports broker, uh, to make a sizable investment in the raptors to beat the knights.

## you want to place a bet?
how much? $100, 000.

## you good for it?
of course i am.

## what makes you so confiident?
well, let's just say i have a good feeling that calvin cambridge is going to have... an off game.

## calvin?
i want to talk to you about something, man.

## what?
well...

## yeah?

i think the film is pretty self explanatory.

## really?
all i heard was something about electromagnets and an incident.

## oh, you mean the splices?
yeah, just a frame here and there, i think, nothing important.

## about the film, what do you think?
i'm sorry i missed it, her funeral.

## do you believe in ghosts, sayid?
i saw walt in the jungle just before shannon was shot.

## does that make me crazy?
it's a long drive back to the arraignment.

## what?
nice corn fed farm girl like yourself, no history of violence, straight a's, no record, a couple of speeding tickets.

## i just gotta wonder, why'd you kill him now?
oh, right, yeah, don't tell me.

## and a gas leak?
come on, it's amateur hour from top to bottom.

## he come knocking on your door late at night?
no, it doesn't work that way.

## you mind if i check out some of this hardware?

no, afraid i don't.

## is there something you need, hurley?
no.

## who's taking care of sawyer?

## sawyer?
no, he's still sleeping.

i can stay if you no.

## tell you what?
i was making a scrapbook, a surprise for your birthday, so i called one of your c. o. s to get some pictures of you in uniform.

## why?
i didn't tell you because i knew you'd kill him.

## so why didn't you kill him?

if you mean the big ass horse standing in the middle of the jungle, then, yeah.

## you know that horse, freckles?
yeah, i do.

## where's the tonic?
we're running a little low on mixers.

## sure you want to waste that on me?
i figured you could use a drink.

this michael.

## how do you do?
i guess i shouldn't have bothered you today.

## would you mind keeping the boy for a few days?
anna'll be pleased to have him.

## when does he leave?
by this time tomorrow, he'll already be gone.

## don't you want to see this?
i've already seen it many times.

## was that an ordinary fog?
it was like nothing i'd ever seen before.

## a garden?
quiet, please.

## those bushes, acacias?
they looked like they were made of plastic, but in real life proportions.

## ls that all?
yes, that's all there is.

oh, this next part is pointless.

## you mean it was human?
yes, human.

## you saw his face?
yes.

## who was he?
it was an infant.

## did you recognize it?
i'd never seen it before.

## what do you mean?
at first i couldn't make it out, but then it became clear that it was incredibly huge.

## what do you mean by saying that the information supplied by me is in no way reflects the actual facts?
i saw all this with my own eyes.

## what action are you going to take in view of prof. messenger's opinion?
practically none at all.

## well, chris, what do you think about all this?
i would like to speak to your son alone.

## where are the guests going to sleep?
upstairs, i guess.

## what is it down there, standing in the garage and looking at me?
no, i don't advocate knowledge at any price.

## ls anything the matter?
i'm leaving.

## leaving?
he is a bookkeeper, not a scientist.

## why did you have to offend him?
it'd been established that the solaris ocean is a peculiar kind of brain.

## all right, what about it?
he looked exactly like the child i'd seen on solaris.

## i wonder why we kept all these?
should something happens, i'll find someone to take care of them.

## have a good trip.
ready, kelvin?

## can you do something?
i seem to be losing stability.

## snout?
i'm kelvin, psychologist.

## did you receive the radiogram?
yes, certainly.

## why are you so upset?
i'm sorry...

## and sartorius?
sartorius is in his quarters.

## dead?
he committed suicide...

## what would i see?
that depends on you.

## hallucinations?
no... but don't forget.

## forget what?
that we're not on earth.

## guibariane wanted to be in the earth, with the worms.
why don't we have our talk tonight?

## have you ever heard of burton?
duty to the truth is the only concern that should count.

## and you, how do i know who you are?
shhh...

## don't worry, i'm not going to think you're insane.
where did she come from?

## me, insane?
oh god, you know so little...

## have you seen her?
try to understand, chris, i'm not mad.

## how did you find out where i was?
don't, chris, that tickles.

## where are my shoes?
no... they're not there.

## who's this?
chris, this is me...

## do you love me?
why do you have to ask, hari, as if you didn't know.

## can't i come with you?
i don't know...

## you can't what?
i feel like i've got to be with you... all the time, to see you...

## why are you being so childish?
i've work to do, hari.

## as who?
as doctor snout.

## why do you keep staring at me?
you might at least knock.

## so you've had visitors?
you handle that very cleanly.

## narcotics, poisons, barbiturates, eh?
lf you came here to clown, you might as well leave.

## try to launch it from the corridor.
you're not going to tell me you haven't tried the rope or hammer?

## do you know what it was?
no.

## who was it?
she died ten years ago.

## what was her name?
hari.

## you think she'll come back?
she will and she won't.

## why didn't you warn me?
you wouldn't have believed me.

## what if she were the contact we've been waiting for, for so long?
the night is a blessed time here.

## chris, where are you?
come here.

## what are you doing right now?
nothing.

## ls it epilepsy?
this is my wife.

## how do you do?
hi.

## are these yours?
no, they're snout's.

## why should l?
you'll see things a lot clearer.

## i used acid to burn the blood, but it regenerates itself.
what do you think, snout?

## there's no need of absorbent cotton.
self regeneration?

## are you qualified to perform an autopsy?
she's my wife.

## don't you understand?
it's more humane to experiment on them than on the earth rabbits.

## it may feel pleasant, but...
did you feel pain when you broke through the door?

## are you envious?
perhaps.

## toward whom are you guilty?
toward you, among others.

## who am l?
as soon as i close my eyes i can't recall what my face is like.

## do you know who you are?
yes, all humans do.

## what happened after that?
after that, i went away.

## where did you go?
to another city.

## why?
i was transferred.

## why didn't you take me with you?
because you refused to come.

## what's up?
the rate of regeneration has slowed.

## and you've come in the middle of the night to tell me that?
i'll tell you exactly why i came.

## yes, but how?
by x rays.

## again your idiotic x ray theories about the greatness of science?
we'll modulate the beam with the brain waves of one of us.

## give everything back to that... mass ofjelly?
it's already invaded my soul.

## blackmail?
i convinced him that we should start with the encephalogram.

## you're trying to patch it up?
yes, i am.

## so she knows how to sleep already?
this is going to end badly.

## what do you propose then?
nothing.

## to the library tomorrow?
we'll set up the table.

## suppose that she follows us?
try leaving the door unlocked this time.

## what door?
it's just a mirage.

## why aren't you sleeping?
you don't love me.

## about what?
i don't know where i came from.

## what are you talking about?
i don't understand anything.

## who've you been talking to?
sartorius told me.

## last night?
sometimes, yes, not always.

## the girl, the other one, what happened to her?
we'd quarreled.

## why do you think she did that?
i believe she felt that i didn't love her anymore.

## why?
perhaps he's having guests.

## that's great.
what is that you're reading?

## now perhaps you'll let me inject a few words of my own?
i propose a toast to snout, to his courage, and his devotion to duty.

## who do you think you are to judge us?
at least i know why i'm here.

## your time is spent lolling in bed day after day.
lf you will permit me to inquire, what exactly are you doing on solaris?

## ls that how you understand your duty?
you're not even a human being.

## i hope i'm not bothering you?
you're really a good fellow.

## could you help me?
certainly he has, absolutely.

## tell me, do you believe in our mission?
i'll stay up a while yet.

## maybe we should whip him with birch leaves?
or we could even pray to it...

## what's the matter?
i think i closed the door...

## ls anything wrong?
no.

## what are you going to do?
wait until she comes back.

## leave the station?
chris, she can live only here, on the station.

## what else can i do?
i love her.

## or the girl on the rocket?
she will return.

## ls it me?
what?..

## why?
you may have looked like her.

## do i disgust you?
nothing...

## what is not indispensable to life is in some way harmful to it?
he's feverish.

## how did guibariane really die?
you haven't told me.

## how was your trip?
it was just a bit tiring.

## are you happy?
happiness is an idea that's obsolete.

## what have you been waiting for?
you might have telephoned.

## what's this?
wait, i'll be right back.

## what is it?
there is no more hari.

## snout, why are we being tortured like this?
we have lost our sense of the cosmic.

## you remember the myth of sisyphus?
since we sent your encephalogram, not a single one of the visitors has returned.

## just like that? ln one stroke?
at least we can hope now.

## how old are you?
fifty two.

## have you been here long?
you must have read my background papers.

## i suppose next you'll want to know what life's all about, eh?
please, let's not be ironical.

## to return to earth?
little by little, everything will come to normal.

## just for the hope of her return?
but i have no hope.

## wait for what?
i don't know...

## are you all right now?
yes, i feel fine.

## chris, what is it?
i love you so much.

## don't you love me any more?
i've made progress, and i recognise that.

## don't you think so?
linda, this is chris kelvin.

## can i help you?
we're looking for dr chris kelvin.

## why not send in the security force?
we did.

## is that what everybody wants?
of course.

## kelvin, is it?
yeah.

## well, you wanna come in?
i'm fine.

## whose blood is that, leading to the lab?
yeah.

## what happened to gibarian?
it was a suicide.

## who found him?
i found him.

## what happened to rhys?
yeah, now, rhys...

## disappeared?
disappeared.

## how did he disappear?
exactly.

## where's dr gordon?
dr gordon.

## can you tell me what's happening here?
i could tell you what's happening, but i don't know if that'd really tell you what's happening.

## didn't you talk to snow?
i wanted to hear your version.

## who are you representing?
i'm the last effort to recover this mission, before they abandon this ship and everyone on board.

## who else is here?
i saw a boy.

## how is that possible?
i think that's why you're here.

## how much sleep?
yeah.

## how long can you go without sleep?
depends.

## did you run any tests on the food, air, water?
i checked it 50 times.

## how are you doing?
depression.

## now, what can you tell me about what's happening here?
just that i want it to stop, but i want to stop it.

## gordon happens to be gordon, you know?
but i'll see what i can do.

## how's the spawn?
oh, good.

## when are you leaving?
we've been postponed again.

## chris?
so anyway...

## don't we all?
don't blow it.

## really?

## do you always resist your impulses?
not always.

## and tonight?
it's early.

## where do you think you are right now?
at home.

## where is home?
with you, where we live.

## being together anywhere else?

## do you remember where we first saw each other?
on a train.

## don't you love me any more?
i don't know.

## can i come and sit with you?
hey.

## what was that?
yeah.

## where's your visitor?
i don't know.

## who's your visitor?
my brother.

## who was it?
my wife.

## do you want her to?
no, it isn't.

## so no one else's opinion counts except for yours?
yeah.

## what'd he say?
he said he liked it.

## please?

## so i wasn't here yesterday?
no.

the mood swings, the restlessness, changing jobs every three months, all of it.

cos i need help.

## aren't we all?
rheya, given all the elements of the known universe and enough time, our existence is inevitable.

you can't explain that.

no.

maybe.

## this is just a theory, you know?
we could be wrong.

## don't you see that as a problem?
i think it's a serious mistake to assume it's benign.

## is that really why you think they're here?

let's start over here.

## why are we whispering?
the whole place is haunted... by ghosts of, um, the civil war soldiers.

## melanie?
hi.

## isn't that something?
yeah.

## but it does roll off the tongue a little sweeter, doesn't it?
huh.

about a year after you left.

## jake was in new york?
last time i checked, yeah.

## why ask me?
oh, i don't know.

## when was the last time you pushed me around the floor?
i ain't as clumsy as i look.

## nah.
why do they fight it?

## what do you say we drive out to fairview and bowl?
i don't think so.

## do you want to go harass somebody?
unh unh.

## dogs don't know anything about that, do they, though?
you were always like a big old pillow.

## he was one hell of a good dog, wasn't he?
yeah.

## since when does it have to be one or the other?
you can have roots and wings, mel.

## what?

## lightning bugs?

## afternoon.

## melanie?
my fiancee.

## melanie smooter?
melanie carmichael.

## god, it's great to meet you both.
oh, you know,

## the battlefield?
you know us southerners.

## melanie... smooter?
local hero around here.

## why is that?
she blew up the bank.

## and that made her a hero?
well, notorious, anyway.

## what cat?
the one with the dynamite on its back.

## she blew up a cat?
he was scheduled to die.

## from dynamite?
the vet said it had cancer, so eldon thought it'd be put in one of those chambers, you know, the ones that suck their lungs out.

## what are you doing here?
well, i came to deliver your fiance.

## what's he talking about?
you and i are in love with two different people.

## is he a second cousin?
he's my husband.

## your what?
i mean my ex husband.

## do you need any help?
it was kind of fun, seeing daddy up there, surrendering.

## i mean, who doesn't?
well, sir... my mother happens to be the mayor up there, and, uh, she'd like nothing better than a big, snazzy new york wedding.

## how many times does your only daughter get married?
other than before.

## felony melanie?
she was never convicted.

## you're supposed to be a democrat, remember?
there is nothing wrong with being poor.

## so what?
she was ashamed of her background.

## who hasn't been embarrassed by their parents at one point?
i'm going to assume that was a rhetorical question.

## and how, exactly, does little miss alabama plan to accommodate 500 people?
i suppose she has connections at the jail.

## it did inspire your identity, did it not?
you thought of everything.

## wasn't it?
hey, tabby, this is it this is the stuff i was telling you about.

## what's the matter?
oh, my god.

## mel?

## friend of yours?
hey.

## am l?
when i married your daddy... oh, lord, but i was a fool for that man.

## he does, doesn't he?
well, even if he is a yankee, at least he's sober.

## melanie?
you are one hard woman to get in touch with.

## what are you doing here?
he did... you didn't.

## you mean i'm still married?
well, not unless you want to be.

## mom?
oh, yeah, sure.

## i don't?
no.

## where's your husband?
apparently, you and i are still hitched.

## is that right?
yeah.

## you can't make the right decisions
at least i fight for what i want.

## oh, what do you want, melanie?
well, the way i hear it, seems she run out on a perfectly good cake.

## wow, did you see that?
jake perry, i'm 10 years old.

## says who?
everybody.

## why would you want to marry me for anyhow?
so i can kiss you any time i want.

## all right, how come y'all let me sleep?
oh, calm down.

## what did i say?
we're all getting big, fat raises when you become somebody.

## frederick, what are you doing here?
you're the competition.

## stella mccartney's gonna kill herself.
competition?

## then why do i feel like i'm in times square buck naked?
baby doll, you're gonna be just fine.

## andrew, are you excited about the show?
uh, of course, i'm very excited.

## the models?

## where are we?
i'm so tired, jimmy.

## a bout what?

## i mean, a a are you really sure?
because if you're not sure, we could just go back to the car.

## thank you.
will you marry me?

## where is he?
i suggest they take a drive on some of the streets in brooklyn.

## do you have a comment?
trust me, if my son were engaged, i'd have a comment.

## jimmy, can you excuse us for a second?
i've been planning this for weeks.

## honey, would you mind terribly if we just kept this to ourselves for a few days?
mel, it's gonna come out sooner or later.

## is it because i'm a yankee?
well, that... and a democrat.

## have you thought about children?
i'm sorry we're late.

## what kept you?
oh, it's none of your business.

## what's going on?
oh, tom, always a pleasure.

## yes?
seems melanie is wearing a skating rink on a very important finger.

## what was i supposed to do?
i know... we read all about it.

## one man for the rest of my life?
i'd bawl my bloody eyes out.

## so why don't you meet us?
we're just around the corner.

## now, how can i help you?
well, for starters, you can get your stubborn ass down here and give me a divorce.

## they laugh at that up north or wherever it is you been?
you knew where i was.

## is that a threat?
he died.

## could we just try to keep this as civilized as possible?
please sign these papers so i can go home.

## what do you know from home?
hell, i bet your folks don't even know you're in town.

## how about her local high school?
there's something wrong here.

## why would my son do this to me?
maybe he, um, loves her.

## he's still wounded from... who was his last girlfriend?
whitney truesdale, lawyer, san francisco.

## did you see the look on my mom's face?
i thought her head was going to explode.

## yeah, what did she say?
that i should date women like melanie, not marry them.

## so, have you two lovebirds set a date?
i'm pleading the fifth.

## you make clothes, right?
i design them.

## yep, i get to frisk pretty little things like you all day and get paid for it.
did you design anything with stripes?

## wade, can you try and be a little more professional?
we got us a crime suspect here.

## use the cuffs, wade, please?
if you get him to sign these, i'll let you run me out of town.

## a bill of divorcement?
mm hmm.

## he didn't hit you, did he?
if he took a swing at you, i'll take him in right now.

## you know what?
i don't have a single childhood memory that doesn't have you two in it.

## remember?
wade...

## wade... isn't there some outstanding warrant for whoever dumped your mama's tractor in the fishpond?
we only have 10 of these, and it's gonna be gone for good.

## we have eight only?
if i knew how to say that in italian, i would, but i don't.

## 15?
honestly.

## hel lo?
hey, mama.

## is that you?
oh, it's so late.

## are you all right?
i, uh... um...

## you gonna repeat everything she says?
if you are, get off my chair.

## what happened to the sound?
it was so loud, i couldn't hear myself think.

## hello?
i only get 3 minutes.

## so, what put you in jail this time?
jake and his big, fat mouth.

## the boy's changed, is all.
can you blame him?

## can we just not talk about jake, okay?
i i know he's the son you never had, but i'm your only daughter, and maybe you want to know what's new with me.

## well, don't i get a smile?
i know you got one in there somewhere.

## do you want me to reheat you some chicken fried steak?
oh, no, mama, i'm fine.

## oh, you know what?
maybe it's the way you're wearing your hair now.

## why don't you sit in my good chair?
now, your mama got me this christmas before last.

## oh, you mean the one where you were supposed to come visit me?
there are hardly words.

## now, how do i get out of this thing?
oh, i see your priorities...

## we're there, all right?
you know, i've really made something of myself.

## pearl, why don't you get us that baloney cake out the icebox?
your mama's a complex woman.

## are you even sure who she is?
i love her, mom.

## i mean, where's the fun in that, right?
i can't believe you kept this thing all these years.

## oh, hey, mel, you know what?

## say, what did this set you back, anyhow?

that's right.

## what's that got to do with this?
just hear me out.

## dr. miesel is currently onsite, examining noah's ark.
three weeks ago?

## old man miesel?
we are about to enter turkish airspace.

## by the way, were the guys behind us told too?
oh, of course.

## where is he now?
i'm afraid we've lost track of him.

## won't we, colonel mac dougall?
give me a break.

## about two years, maybe?
an armguard with approximately fifty meters of climbing wire.

## who are you?
i'm jean.

## where's miesel?
now i'm going to wring your neck...

## but colonel, what if arcam gets into the ark?
not to worry.

## who was he?
my old commander.

## revenge?
you think it's their fault that you're like this now or something.

## so, this is noah's ark?
it's bigger than i thought.

## can't you open it?
it's made of some kind of time stop material.

## u. s. machine corps?
cyborgs attached to the pentagon.

## what's so funny?
he'll be here soon.

## move.
who are you?

## so, you're mac dougall?
you have a magnetic amplifier implanted in your brain.

## there must be some meaning behind the location of the ark.
where's that kid?

## what if the ark itself is what caused the flood?
perhaps mt.

## ararat exerts a strong magnetic field that suppresses it?
that's it.

## who knows what might happen?
i see...

## where's the old man?
inside, i guess.

## why didn't you follow them?
but...

## let's get started, doctor.
so, this is noah's heart?

## you okay?
take care.

## why does the pentagon want it?
using it would be like signing your own country's death warrant.

## what is this?
noah probably caused the ice age that destroyed the dinosaurs, but it has other functions besides changing the atmosphere.

## what are these things?
in other words, noah is also a machine for the generation of life.

## then i have no choice.
well, doctor?

## the majority of the land will be flooded.
what are you going to do?

## well, what will you do, doctor?
there's no going back.

## don't you get it yet?
your orihalcon suit that you're so proud of is like a toy to me.

## don't you understand that for them you're just an expendable item?
neither the pentagon nor the machine corps concern me now.

## is that all it took to drive you mad?
we are not machines.

## what are you doing?
i said i'm not an instrument for killing.

## what?
you're right.

## what did you say?
shut up and let me carry you.

## what's that?
so, that's what the ark really looks like.

## god!
give me a break.

## who the hell talks like that?
oh.

## someone's watching us.
hey, what about my nipples?

## a peeper, huh?
my kind of guy.

## what?
no, they're dead.

## you got any objections, ricky?
you don't wanna know.

## too waxy?
shh.

## say, what do you think about smacking me in the face a couple of times?
not hard.

## what do you say?
no.

## what the hell does that mean?

## how could somebody steal both boats?
i don't know.

## and that phone line had definitely been cut?
it sure as shit was not chewed up by jungle rats.

## okay, what are we gonna tell the guests?
nothing.

## we tell the guests there's some crazed maniac on the island with no way off?
we're gonna have a hundred crazed maniacs running around.

## what about the sign on cliff?
i mean, that means he's targeting us.

## why are they coming after us?

## watch a classic?
i think we'll, uh, probably pass.

## is it the subtitles?
you know me too well.

## what?
you know what.

## why am i not excited by it?
um, because i don't think any of these new age arts colleges are really colleges.

i know how many boxes are here.

## and what does that mean?
you know what it means.

## other guys i played with, they, uh... pulled car dealerships out their asses, you know, ran insurance companies after they retired?
that wasn't me.

## so what is it about you and baseball?
aw, come on, why don't you just call in to the show if you're gonna hit me with that one.

## what are you so touchy about?
nothing.

## i'm just not sure what they want from me anymore, you know?
it was good.

## i'm tired, okay?
i'm just...

## you know what it is i like about going over to your house, terry?
i like how it smells.

## and i don't even mind going over there when there's tension, and there's a... there's a fucking lot of it, you know?
somebody is always mad at somebody.

## believe me, this is not where i saw my life going, okay?
this is not how i would've drawn it.

## what's the big deal?
she would have gotten married anyway.

## do i look horrible?
no.

## are you kidding?
you... are... a beautiful, gorgeous bride.

## i am?
oh, god.

## you're... wh... 10 minutes before my wedding ceremony?
that's just mean.

## can we focus on those?
right, right, right.

## don't let them make up your mind emily.
is any bond as sacred as this one?

## would you like to dance with me?
i don't think so.

## not drinking today?
i don't have a problem.

## i mean, what is that about?
you manipulate young women, use your power and title to seduce them, and get them to run around with you.

## yeah, so?
i don't.

## settle down and marry some pissed off thing like you?
nothing.

## what did you say?
we had a heart to heart.

## emily, what's up?
hold... hold on.

## baby?
i should go with you.

## i don't want her to be scared, okay?
i'll be fine.

## you're at a loss?
she's in a lot of pain.

## well, what are you gonna do in the morning?
actually, i won't be here in the morning.

## tomorrow night?
yes.

## and what if i want a second opinion?
well, i haven't given you a first one yet.

## and if i want a second opinion?
it's 4:30 am.

## well, why would they do something like that?
because i didn't give them candy, that's why.

## did you call daddy to tell him?
um...

## did you talk to the doctor?
yes.

## did he tell you it wasn't cancer?
yes, he did.

## why is that funny?
because you just don't seem to care all that much about me, unless, like now, i'm sick.

## i don't see that.
you do?

## well, what can i say?
you're like everybody else in my life you need to pay closer attention to me.

## you going next, gorden?
hell no.

## you're not gonna jump?
no, he won't jump.

## denny?
i called you eight times today.

## denny?
i want you to talk to me.

## they're gonna build a subdivision back there?
yeah, next month, they break ground.

## she's coming, okay?
big smiles... and compliments, but normal though.

## why don't you just put some valium in her soup?
don't test me tonight, hadley, i mean it.

## what?
so...

## really?
wow.

## what do you know?
you're a child.

## you're dumping me?
no, not really.

## and continue seeing each other?
no, probably not.

## so, you don't want to sleep together anymore?
i can't believe we're hearing this.

## is this because your mother detests me?
a lot of people do.

## been, y y you know, quick, whatever you're saying?
i don't know.

## you guess?
you make a lot of noise and a lot of very odd sounds for someone that guesses.

## you know what?
it was inevitable.

## right?
yeah, i guess so.

## i mean... me producing morning drive and you in the afternoons?
yeah.

## what?
this place is too small time for you.

## how much time?
mr. scofield, looks like i'll be administering your shot today.

## what happened?
we got to move.

## where are the keys?
my pocket.

## we're gonna get you to a hospital, all right?
a gift from my cell mate.

## the watch what's it for anyway?
thought you didn't want to know about any of this.

## why the sudden change of heart?
i have my reasons.

## how much we talking about?
i think you know.

## you lied?
we're cons.

## now, do you want the money or not?
no offense, but it's a little convenient.

## how do i know you're not lying right now?
the way i see things, it's everyone else that's lazy.

## you gonna let him talk about your people like that?
uh, whatever, deliverance.

## you know what?
we may be a team in here, but just so that you know, the minute we get over that wall, it's every man for himself.

## do you know how the russians do things?
they let you live, and they kill everyone else in your family, and, well, any anyone you've ever loved.

## how does that sound?
go to hell.

## is that any way for a lady to talk?
oh.

## i'm just going to walk into a well?
seriously, ms. donovan.

## you all right?
scofield, no sitting down on the job.

## would you like a private dance?

## you guys get lost?
we tried to call you again to pinpoint your signal, but you never picked up.

## so, uh, how'd it go?
i have a broken leg down here.

## right?
we're both just trying to tie up some loose ends.

## what the hell is that?
yeah.

## what the hell is that?
listen.

## am i supposed to be hearing something?
shh.

## we sat around here for 20 minutes waiting to hear that?
18 minutes, actually.

## what was it?
keys.

## what does that mean?
it means...

## is that doable?
of course.

## what's up?

## come on, michael, talk to me.
what's up?

## you want the good news or the bad?
the good.

## what's the bad?
i've done the math.

## is that doable?
of course.

## baby, what the hell is going on?

## where's maricruz?
she's not gonna be coming around here anymore.

## this is a joke, right?

## how much time?
enough for me to find my way up a 20 foot vertical drain pipe without using a ladder.

## well, i don't have a choice, do i?
i can come and go without using the door, and with westmoreland as a lookout, we'll have one more man available for dig.

## mind if i share that with the rest of the class?
apparently, college boy here did the math.

## how is this your problem, man?
he doesn't know what he's talking about.

## right?
oh, pardon me for interrupting.

## but, uh... what's that smell?
it smells a little like... conspiracy.

## what do you mean?
look who you're walking with right now.

## so?
scofield is only here for one reason:his brother.

## and the night that fish goes into that hole, you think he wants to carry all that extra baggage?
i don't know about you, but i'm going.

## yeah, he probably tells you, the less you know, the better, right?
you don't know what you're talking about.

## what for?
i swiped you that watch, man.

## where's my pl?
that's not gonna happen.

## no, they see a bullet, they're gonna call the cops.

and what excatly is he preliminary research said he is something that actually we have never faced before, mr president?

## he dates the same woman for 6 years, but he never pops the question.
that's it?

## but would the easiest thing be...
what's wrong with the picture?

## i... i canceled that sir.
should we discuss our withdraw?

## you.. what?
it... seems obvious we are right in the middle of campagin.

that's a great idea.

## everything is all right?
there... ah, it's beyond me. sir.

## i suggest hand shake, sir.

uh, yeah.

## well, mr. president?
i'm sorry, gentlemen.

## so we'll hear from you in the morning, sir?

## you know how you can't smell your own smell?
that's what we got going on here.

## so is this thing over?
it's over for me.

## you wanna get something to eat?

i don't have a problem.

## what's on tap today?
read the paper.

## sir?
actually, i'm considering it.

## yeah, why not?
largely ceremonial.

## why not mooseport?
w well, sir, actually...

## as your first move out of office, you become mayor?
it's, uh, beneath you.

## she can't claim this is a vacation house if i'm the mayor, can she?
true.

## sir, it's a touch more complicated than that.
you have the eagle's word, okay?

## what's complicated?
it's just that, you see, sir, it kind of got out in the press that you're both in.

## what press?
well...

## did they, stu?
no, sir.

## what, are you telling me the entire country thinks i'm running for mayor... against the man installing my toilets?
ah, hell!

## what is this?
that's bruce the moose, sir.

## shouldn't it be in a zoo?
afternoon, mr. president.

## is everything okay with that water heater?
everything is fine.

## handy, aren't you gonna introduce me?
yeah.

## how can i help you, mr. president?
well, handy, as i'm sure you know, we've both put in for mayor.

## you didn't know that?
i knew that i put in.

## is it serious?
well, it got out to the press that i had given my word.

## are you any good?
i get around.

## ten?
me too.

## what's settled?
it turns out we both put in for mayor, so i just withdrew.

## did anybody happen to notice that?
he probably chewed through the rope.

## rude?
don't be silly.

## it is, isn't it?
i'm so glad i ran into you.

## dinner?
yeah, i could really use your, uh, professional advice on this.

## my advice?
mm hmm.

## sally, is it me... or did you just get asked out by that president guy?
yes, i think i did.

## and and is it me or did you just say yes... to the president guy?
yes, i think i did.

## why not?
here.

## thank you very much.
what is it?

## uh huh?
i can't do it, sir.

## excuse me?
i, uh, i don't have the eagle thing like you, but i'm a man of my word too.

## wh what is it?
l... uh...

## what just happened?
mm hmm.

## why didn't you tell me?
i'm gonna look like an idiot.

## for what?
i don't need a campaign manager for this.

## hello?
one second.

## you watching fox news?
the results are quite interesting.

## are you dr. sally mannis?
yeah.

## is it true you've been seeing mr. harrison for six years?
now you're dating the president.

## for our mayor, we could have the president of the united states.
you wouldn't call it a date?

## what are you trying to do to us?
come on.

## hey, handy.
handy!

## do you like it?
uh, that's... yeah.

## do you care about sally or not?
power takes 10 years off a man, handy.

## up and running.
so, you want to campaign or not?

## so how do we kick this thing off, bert?
top priority, obviously, is to keep him presidential.

## and what exactly is he?
preliminary research says that he is something... that actually we've never faced before, mr. president.

## and that is?
he's a genuinely honest man, sir.

## what do you got, bert?
f. b. i., c. i. a... nothing.

## and, uh, that's it?
that's it.

## that's good.
what's wrong with this picture?

## how do we get that out?
whisper campaign, at first.

## not to mention what it would do to his finances.
should we discuss a withdrawal?

## finances?
book deals, corporate boards, library fund raising.

## you what?
it it seemed obvious.

## but have you seen the car?
look at this.

## may i stay now, sir?
go in the corner, out of my eye line.

## what about this sally handy, sally eagle wank off?
he'll have to cancel the date.

## should i draft a press release?
uh, yeah.

## you see where i'm going with this, or do i have to draw you a picture?
i see it, mr. president.

## good morning, mr. president.
handy, what are your policies?

## you got toilet trouble, right?
yeah.

## call him a horndog!
well, uh...

## where are you taking her?
i don't know what you're gonna see.

## do we have any ice cream?
absolutely, sir.

## really?
yes.

## that's it?
nothing to it.

## you wanna see a movie or something?
you know i have plans tonight.

## did you see this?
local vet finds romance with past president.

## where'd they get that picture?
yeah.

## i mean, he must go to bed at, like, 8:30, right?
so, there's supposed to be a meteor shower at 11:00.

## can you just cancel the date with the president?
so that's wednesday.

## where are you taking her?
the pig and the whistle, the only steakhouse in town.

## do you know it?
no.

## do i have anything in common with this girl?
she's a veterinarian.

## why don't you talk about mad cow disease?
don't, by the way, order meat.

## why not?
it's just a guess, but she might not appreciate your wolfing down... the animal she spent all day trying to save.

## wh what, do you... do you really actually like this guy?
he wants to talk to me about dogs.

## why you all dressed up then?
because he's the president.

## what difference does it make what color my underwear is?
it's an unconscious indicator... of your subconscious intentions.

## how do you feel about the pink?
no.

## uh, these?
all right.

## or do you like any of these?
yeah.

## or you know what?
i could always go with none at all.

## 8:00, for two, yes?
well, i'll be buggered by a bear.

## can you move that up?
this feels wrong.

## and him making her his booty poodle isn't?
you have to stop saying that, please.

## are we ready yet?
uh, i hope you're hungry.

## sally?
uh, i'm not sure yet.

## sometimes you just want a steak, right?
yeah.

## ma'am?
all right.

## it's a nice night, isn't it?
handy for mayor.

## debate?
yeah.

## you see?
yeah.

## now?
well, now is not the time or place, handy... but, uh, let's say the town hall tuesday night.

## okay, why don't we let everybody get back to their dinner?
all right.

## would you excuse me for just one minute?
yes, certainly.

## campaign?
you're making a fool of yourself.

## what's in it?
they're, uh...

## should i get it to the f. b. i.?
yes.

## it's going well, don't you think?
mr. president, sir.

## what?
yes, sir.

## was that a meteor?
there's supposed to be a shower tonight.

## maybe it's a good omen, huh?
i just wanna apologize again for handy.

## the president got vetoed.
and you, sir?

## can you believe it?
definitely the cold shoulder.

## cold shoulder?
the president lost that one.

## it's off.
turn it off, all right?

## well, how do we fix this?
we don't.

## what's wrong with the debate?
putting him on the stage with you gives him credibility.

## huh?
n not weakness.

## green boy.
they know i'm kidding, don't they?

## wh...
what?

## this?
right.

## hey, dina.
can you all hear me?

## what took ya?

## rock, paper, scissors.
no!

## okay?
on the count of three.

## clay?
i been fishing there for 30 years.

## what's gonna happen?
uh, for 10 years now... we have needed a stop sign in front of lucy decker's house.

## if elected, what will you do about it?
first off...

## lucy, let me ask you, what's the problem?
car headlights.

## excuse me?
you know, blackout curtains for your windows.

## mandy gutman?
dad, this is a question for handy.

## is that okay?
well, if the president has no objection.

## okay, people, can we keep the questioning to the subject of the election?
i think joe had a question...

## sally.
you gotta know how much i care about you, right?

## are you crazy?
you didn't answer the phone, and you took the key out of the frog.

## what i said up there, doesn't that mean anything?
i heard you talking about my underwear in front of the whole town.

## is it me or your new truck?
well, you heard it here first.

## why not?
excuse me.

## well, what's her problem?
maybe she saw the numbers.

## what are you talking about?
this is impossible.

## uh... sir?
excuse me.

## yes?
we could eliminate him.

## what?
you wanna make it look like an accident, of course.

## what, are you insane?
uh, no, sir, i was...

## did i misunderstand the question?
thank god you guys are on our side.

## eating me?
yes.

## really?

## the sure way, sir?
dyer, this is too smart for her.

## it was him, wasn't it?
yeah.

## does anybody remember that?
handy for mayor.

## did handy put you up to this?
hello, monroe.

## charlotte, hon, could we talk in private, please?
this is as private as i got for 20 years.

## what's on your mind?
fine.

## why do you think she's here, mr. president?
okay, neil.

## charlotte, would you step into my office?
yes, dear.

## twenty five years.

## a quarter of a century i endured, and now you're pleading poverty?
you took the house, the boat.

## have i gotten through to you, lambkins?
i never thought you'd stoop this low, harrison.

## have you no sense of decency, sir?
i'm sorry.

## sir.
you're showing your true colors, aren't you?

## is he serious?
you just called me dishonorable, sir, a a and i'm not.

## and your back?
it's just the lip, and, uh... it's fine.

## wanna hit a few?
yeah.

## like this?

## so?
you ended up in the water.

## spectacular, isn't it?
i was thinking about...

## what?

## can you do that?
a long while back... my mom asked me what i saw in you.

## sugar, mr. president?

## why?
because he needs it.

## dirt?
no, it's...

## did you get it?
oh, that's...

## are you okay?
you did it again.

## what about this?
bow on my head.

## is handy around?

## that you're really cute?
you're pretty yourself.

## sleep.
sangmin, what are you doing?

## did we paint that much?
the festival's coming up.

## really?
we'll see about that...

## really?
let's wash our hands and grab some snacks.

## are you taking care of sangmin's meals?
it's really hard to be an intern you know.

## what kind of wife are you?
then you be his wife.

## good?
yeah.

## hey, isn't she a babe?
hey, let me see.

## where?
it really is his sister.

## then, who's that?
she must've fallen for a younger dude.

## did you get a good shot?
here.

## already?
hurry in and sit.

## can't you be more early?
yes, of course.

## that's her?
she's better than your sister.

## this marriage... it seems like your grandpa forced you into it, but in fact we wanted to have sangmin as our son in law.
who's that?

## how often you would cry?
but whenever sangmin came, a smile would spread on your face.

## are you doing well?
a few days ago, heavy snow came down in seoul.

## it's colder here, right?
don't catch cold.

## i'm a bit behind than the other girls, but being an idiot that you are, you won't understand what i mean, will you?
it's strange but when you were around, i hated your guts, but your absence has me missing you.

## are you feeling the same?
then be good to me from now on.

## where have you been?
i've been looking all over for you.

## yeah, what?
i'm sorry.

## what's got into you?
now, intern, park sangmin will share a few words with us.

## didn't you know?
of course, it's not a sin to be married.

## but in fact you're married to a 15 year old high school girl, right?
to suh boeun who's sitting right there...

## who would marry a lop sized ball man if they knew, right?
right.

## they're going to have a coin toss.
did you get married to peel garlic?

## you gonna be all right?
i'm okay.

## you're serious?
that's right.

## what the hell kind of way is that to make a decision?
when you assemble the kind of talent that we have here, and then you just throw it away like that.

## and now?
ain't no way.

## that's what it is.
what about winchell's play tonight?

## you know what else it is, too?
get this sickness out of my stomach.

## do you know what that is?
that's a state championship.

## hell with it.
can you touch that?

## you ever feel cursed, coach?
like, no matter what, inside your heart you feel that you're gonna lose.

## why you gotta be so messed up?
you can't win.

## fact of the matter is, i believe that, uh, our only curses are the ones that are self imposed.
what is wrong with you?

## coaches ready?
one.

## does this look like heads to you, doug?
i can't tell the difference.

## i'll make you proud.
what's up, water bug?

## now what we gonna do?
hey, hey.

## don't worry about it?
you'll be all right, son.

## why?
we practiced and we practiced.

## what the hell am i gonna do without my knee?
yeah.

## somewhere like that?
or, you know what we could do, is the astrodome.

## now are these zebras gonna be white or black?
well, as far as i know, zebras are white and black.

## how many black stripes these zebras got?
i believe a zebra's got about the same amount ofblack ones as he does white ones.

## how many black stripes you think a zebra's got?
it makes sense to hire a crew as is.

## so you think having an all black officiating crew is gonna somehow help you win the game?
watch your mouth.

## you?
oh, pretty good.

## oh, is that right?
i'll be dogged.

## everything all right?
well, yeah.

## yeah?
well.

## all right?
let's just get out there and get it done.

## are we gonna move again?
no, baby.

## sure are.
what do you think about alaska?

## you get any sleep last night?
oh, yes, sir.

## you got room for one more?
howser makes the tackle on the three yard line.

## mike i want you to be patient in there, all right?

they're big.

## fun ride, huh, big boy?
they're dirty.

## you understand me?
yes, sir.

## are you gonna let the offense do everything, or are you gonna help us out some?
i'm gonna help us.

## you gonna help us out some?
okay.

## did you see that?
back up, coach.

## are you in the game?
yes, sir.

## y'all need to wake up out there and play football, okay?
you need to find each other.

## what?
time has run out in the first half.

## to go for two and get it every single time?
that is ridiculous.

## do you realize they have not even kicked a field goal yet?
just relax.

## you hear me?
they bleed just like we do.

## do you hear me?
they went through two a days.

## with joy in your heart?
if you can do that, gentlemen, then you're perfect.

## are you hungry?
that's the way to play ball.

## he can't drop back fast enough, all right?
yeah, it's good.

## look, did you see it?
i'm gonna talk to him.

## jason?
i turned and looked, but i was lost.

## are you sure he caught that football?
his was a catch, ref.

## we've seen games like this before, but permian's always been on the other end.
that was a bad call!

## all right?
comer got across the five.

## but is it too little, too late for coach gary gaines?
second down and long.

## okay?
execute.!

## you all right?
come on.

## did you see that?
comer is on queer street, walking towards the carter sideline.

## you got that?
got it.

## so, clay, if you're gary gaines, what do you do?
coach gaines is done out of running backs.

## billingsley, can you do it?
yes, sir.

## can you hang onto the ball?
yes, sir.

## what?
you got him short.

## there's no chance a mistake could have been made?
oh...

## deal?
just don't tell your mother.

## me?
fine, just needed a little field trip.

## but why does it keep crashing?
you've been virussed.

## what can we do?
don't try hitting the escape key.

## but did you install it?
the minute we got it i think.

## can we put it on sale this week?
yes.

## could i show my appreciation and take you to dinner?

very little.

## is the implication that dr. stone deliberately misled us?
perhaps not deliberately, senator.

## from what you're saying, it was just a shot in the dark?
perhaps that's a little unfair, senator.

i call that dr. stone's $90 million mash note to uncle sam.

roger.

## coronary?
i doubt it.

## are you sure that isn't coronary?

## what happened?
the town is finished, contaminated beyond all...

## has the president made his decision on directive 7 12 yet?
he doesn't jump into things, dr. robertson.

## what do you think, mr. secretary?
it's against the moscow treaty of 1963... to fire thermonuclear weapons above ground.

## yes, chief?
yes, sir.

## by whose decision, general, was the site for wildfire chosen?
dr. stone's.

## weren't you worried the infection might spread to them?

getting rid of the tread marks.

## where's our leader?
we'll catch up to him and hall very soon now.

you, a sourdough?

## what you said before, you don't believe the infection in that capsule was brought back deliberately, do you?
skip it.

## how'd you know that?
oh, dutton, i have a long criminal record.

## how's piedmont?
i had to order up a 7 12.

## how are you, ruth?
no other way to halt the infection spread.

## oh, you two know each other, don't you?
by reputation only.

## any messages for me from the white house?
not a thing, dr. stone, or you'd have it.

## no personal messages?
no, ma'am.

## are you sure, sergeant?
dr. stone, sir, i have one thing to do.

## what for?
they'll be treated and returned to you, doctor.

## who picked leavitt?
talk about the odd man hypothesis, which we haven't yet.

## what's it for?
you're the odd man.

## when?
never, we hope.

## why me?
because you're single.

## where, exactly, are we now?
there's one way you can always locate yourself or any of us instantly.

## where's the capsule?
the patients are the yellow x's.

## what are their chances, hall?

## sounds like you're getting a little paranoid in this fun house.
you're saying stone's $90 million facility, which you recommended, was knocked out by a sliver of paper?

## what does stone think... about the ultimate weapon, i mean?
we've isolated the organism.

we sent you a couple messages on it.

## like he was crazy?
he was mighty confused, that's for sure.

## stone, can i see you?

none.

matt.

## you fought it, right?

i didn't tell him.

## he doesn't know?
i probably would have done the same thing.

## yeah?
once he finds out his golden boy got kicked out of harvard, he'll dive headfirst into an empty swimming pool.

## how are you doing?
it's good to finally meet you.

## finally made it across the pond?

## you call that a fight?
fuck it.

## about soccer?
no, mate.

## who cares?
all that means is he can have a wank faster than you.

## what is it with you americans?
you start a fucking war, bottle it, then we have to come save your arse again.

## save our ass?
yes.

## look, we're sort of going into my place of business, right?

## bov's a miserable cunt, but we love him dearly, don't we?
sometimes.

## what's with all the fucking babysitting?
you know we had a meet set up for today.

## he's got a point.
what?

## you let me worry about that, all right, boys?
as for the yank, he's too modest to tell you, but back in the states he's an internationally ranked double black belt in karate.

## bloody karate kid film?
based on his exploits.

## really?
you've been here fucking five minutes and you're lying.

## that's horse piss, right?
oh, no, no.

## what was your coach's name?
little chink geezer.

## in the first one?
all fucking three.

## why'd you let the side down?
you owe it all to him.

## did they pay him?
pete might be showing you a bit of courtesy, you being shannon's brother, but get it straight, we don't like outsiders.

## all right, mate?
come on.

## you had your hands full, didn't you?
it ain't over yet.

## what you heard?
the usual.

## what are we standing here for?

## a fucking yank.

## why's a yank running with the gse?
i don't know anything about the gse.

## do you take american express?
i bet the major gave out his share of chelsea grins, back when the gse weren't so sloppy to leave one of their own behind.

## where the fuck is he?
i'm getting too old for this shit.

## whose round do you think it is?
oh, here we go.

## who?
the geezer you was just fighting.

## now we've all stopped kissing each other's arses, see the first punch he threw?
on the feminine side.

## come on, yous all wanna get pinched?
let's push him out.

## how do you feel?
oh, a little sore.

## so, what is this?
bollocks journo bullshit.

## are you guys like an organised political movement or something?
no, mate.

## you never heard of a firm in the states?
no.

## what about millwall?
ah, millwall.

## where to even fucking begin with millwall?
millwall and west ham firms hate each other more than any other firms.

## who's the major?
ah, the major.

## what did i say to you?
no trouble.

## and you saw the whole thing from your sofa?
concentrate on your family and leave my business to me.

## do you want mum to visit you in the nick?
shannon, i'm fine.

## pete, can't you see what you're doing to this family?
all i see is a scared old man.

## fancy a pint?
leave it out, bov.

## bov, we've known each other a long time, yeah?
i trust you more than any other bloke i know.

## everything all right, mate?
i can't believe you came all this way and didn't even stay the night.

## so you and steve are ok?
yeah.

## what answer?

## what was you studying, before this geezer stitched you up?
history.

## history?
i teach history.

## you teach?
yes, cheeky slag.

## what, did you think the gse paid a bloody wage?
i'm smart as fuck.

## you know how these americans bruise.
it's our job to save this heathen from his evil ways and teach him what really matters in life, and that is?

## i let every other ball go through?
i wouldn't worry about that.

## you ready?
go on, son.

## what was that?
go on, my son.

## that was like the junior olympic football team, right?
no, mate.

## who are you?
but these kids...

## how are you doing, son, all right?
i'll say one thing, you got some fucking front showing your face over this side of the water.

## so, bov, what's all this i'm hearing about your firm gone all fucking international, eh?
don't you even fucking think about ignoring me, you little cunt.

## now, i said what's all this bollocks i'm hearing about you having a little yank on the firm?
it's only temporary.

## what's his problem?
shh.

## where's your other little girl...?
petey.

## trying to get her little toes into the major's big fucking shoes?
i guess we was pretty small back then, son.

## do you think that'd wind him up?

## oh, you know?
tommy, the paki's called the old bill, mate.

## nervous?

## would you like to play with us?

## you're not worried about the opposition, are you, mr. burton?
a team of life's losers, led by a man who can be bought and sold.

## i'm not putting you under pressure, right?
but i'm burning up phone cards... taking bets from prisons up and down the country.

## run towards the monk.
know what i mean?

## yeah?
on you go, half pace.

## what happened to number three?
when you're helping them up... grab the hairs under his armpits and twist them round.

no.

## now, ask yourselves one question.
what?

## are you ready?
yes.

## i'm not worried.
are we?

## where'd they get those uniforms?
cheeky bastards.

## simple ball every time, eh?
boy, mr. sykes, you look the part.

## what's the matter with you?
shut up, you pussy.

## which one's he, then?
you four stand there.

## piss off, you scotch bastard.
you what?

## do that again, i'll rip your head off.
how's your daughter, by the way?

## ref, did you hear that?
i'm not worried.

## what is he doing?
you're supposed to throw this game.

## what do you think meehan will be saying to the boys?
he'd be telling them that there's only 45 minutes left to play.

## just don't leave us exposed at the back, all right?
mouse it's me nose.

## where am i playing?
take his place.

## have you forgotten who they are?
they're the dregs of society and they're in the next dressing room... and they're laughing at you right now.

## you wanted to see me?
yes.

## what the hell's going on?
you wanted a game.

## what goes through monk's head?
scary thought, bob.

## you get it, bob?
whatever, bob.

## locked in a cell for 23 hours a day... and today our boys have their day.
that's going a bit too far, isn't it?

## what's up with you?
for the last hour of my life sentence...

## the cons kick off.
what's monk doing?

## but what is he doing?
there's no cohesion.

## there's no character, eh?
the mean machine really need their star player... to pick up his game now.

## what is meehan doing, anyway?
it's like he's not even on the pitch.

## what's up with you?
i never touched you.

## you're cheating now, are you?
once a loser, always a loser.

## where'd you get hit?
down there.

## why don't people just let me play this game?
didn't think you'd sell us out.

## is there something i should know?
he's fucked something up.

## who's coming on?
me.

## who's in charge here?
i'm in charge.

## you?
yes.

## the owner?
yes.

## i didn't fucking see you, did i?
obviously not.

## are you gonna do absolutely nothing about that?
it's a free kick.

## how long, ref?
just moving into injury time.

## what was that?
looks like your saab.

## okay?
shut up.

## perimeter, what's your status?
delta team, clear.

## her?
i was afraid if i told you, you wouldn't take the job.

## who do you think's coming for you?
you may have heard of her.

## you find that funny?
she's an urban legend, sir.

## really?
well, then somebody must have brought her back from the dead.

## delta, what's your status?
there's no signal.

## just cold?
don't worry.

## how do you know?
i died once.

## so am i to understand that with all the power of the hand... that the treasure continues to elude us?
yes.

## you dare to blame master roshi?
seems our methods are too mild for kirigi.

## kirigi?
yes, father.

## you think that's safe, leaving the door unlocked like that?
geez, elektra, you're gonna end up with a bullet in your head.

## why do you always do this?
get rid of my d. n. a.

## it's all there?
less my 10 .

## half to barbados?
and half to the bank on the isle of man.

## was it necessary?
had to be done.

## did it?
elektra.

## did it?
okay.

## you're tired?
well, then you better get yourself some sleep...

## i mean, you even get laid?
it's a lot of money, this new offer.

## you know what?
look, you want to take time off, take time off.

## how much?
kimagure, the ability to control time... the future... even life and death.

## is this a test, sensei?
no, not a test.

## why?
no idea.

## listen, why don't you tell me about the view?
nothing.

## how did you get in?
the front door was unlocked.

## so, who are you anyways?

## and what?
they killed my wife, abby's mom.

## has she told you what she actually does for a living, mr. miller?
she saved my life and my daughter's.

## what are we gonna do?
you gotta run.

## you're not coming with us?
no.

## isn't that part of your code or something?
i don't have a code, abby.

## how are we supposed to defend ourselves?
she's down the street.

## should we go now?
not here.

## so, you, um... you really kill people for a living?

## what about you?
shit.

## don't tell me, the circus is in town, huh?
the war is over.

## this whole war with the hand, everything, it's all about her, isn't it?
they call her the treasure.

## what if i had failed?
some lessons can't be taught, elektra.

## what about abby?
as long as kirigi is alive, she's only safe here.

## sorry?
o. c. d.

## are you counting?

## wanna find out?
i'm gonna go find my dad.

## what do you want?

## so, what's next?
kirigi's gone.

## back to school?
go to the beach and get a tan.

## will i see you again?

## and what could be more perfect than this?
a noble prince, a priceless treasure, and a black hearted thief.

## cetus?
i thought you overworked it.

## oh, and i was overworking it?
proteus.

## how long has it been?
about a lifetime ago.

## sinbad?
oh.

## what are you doing here?
i'm working.

## where have you been?
hey, love to stop and catch up, but i've got things to do, places to go, stuff to steal.

## really?
now, see, now, l i just feel bad, because you're going to get fired.

## you disappear for ten years, show up, and rob me?
i wish it wasn't you.

## and what would you do with it anyway?
the book of peace protects all of us in the twelve cities.

## what the...?
uh, yeah.

## here, you'll need this.
w what are you doing?

## oh...
where are you going?

## you okay?
yeah.

## and you are?
eris, the goddess of discord.

## from you?
sinbad, you don't have a heart.

## so, where were we?
oh, yes.

## what happened down there?
oh, i'm writing that down.

## so, that's it then?
no book.

## now what do we do?
this is what happens when you use the front entrance.

## what is he doing here?
at least he's not out robbing someone.

## you hear that, guys?
dinner and drinks are on the prince.

## weapons?
here she is.

## so, which are you... a thief or a hero?
sinbad wanted to give me an opportunity to thank...... him.

## just like that?
but the book is almost ours.

## an old girlfriend?
i'm afraid it's not that simple.

## what?
l i...

## you were talking about the ocean, weren't you?
i only wish i'd seen more of it.

## marina... will you marry me?
proteus, i...

## it's about time.
huh?

## then how do you explain this?
eris.

## what?
eris... she framed me.

## you know me.
trial?

## do i?
i knew a kid.

## who are you now, sinbad?
look me in the eye and tell me.

## did you steal the book?
no.

## let him go to tartarus and recover the book.
how many times do i have to say it?

## what are you doing?
you claim that eris stole the book... steal it back.

## tartarus?
oh, no, no, no, no.

## so where are we going?
fiji.

## this time of year?
think of the beaches.

## dymas is not going to let them execute his only son.
you're sure of that?

## so we're running away?
we're retiring.

## what do you think you're doing here?
i'm here to make sure you get the book of peace.

## and how are you going to pull that off?
by whatever means necessary.

## did you bring a crew?
no.

## you know how to get to tartarus?
um... no.

## then i'll dump your butt in a rowboat, and you can paddle all the way back to syracuse.
can you navigate on your own?

## fiji?
yup.

## what?
sinbad, you're not a very complicated guy.

## you're really not going to lose any sleep over this, are you?
not a wink.

## uh... just how do you expect to do that?
by speaking your language.

## how did she even get on the ship?
gentlemen, we have a new course.

## no beaches?
rat.

## but did you say tartarus?
that's right.

## will that be the same tartarus from which no sailor ever returns?
the tartarus of lost souls, where they grind your bones and pickle your spleen, and...

## you know, with little umbrellas?
non ci posso credere, non ci posso credere, mi hanno fregato ancora.

## so how do we get there?
that star's our point.

## the dragon's teeth?
indeed, signorina.

## are you sure you know what...?
yes, we've done this kind of thing before.

## what is that sound?
come with me.

## who's bad?
sinbad saved us.

## uh...
marina saved us?

## do you have any idea what i went through to steal these?
that's exactly why women shouldn't drive.

## you happy now?
proteus, come quickly.

## wh...?
there's a ship waiting in the harbor.

## to live the rest of my life in exile?
to live, son.

## how did one woman do so much damage?
all right, i'm going to need the full set of chisels, the jack plane, and about a cord of cut wood.

## may i assist you, lady?
why, thank you.

## that's what this is all about, isn't it?
it's about repairing the ship.

## oh, yeah, like i'd give you a weapon?
i don't know.

## how did you two ever meet?
running for my life, as usual.

## what is it?
we... took different paths.

## for crying out loud, what next?
hmph.

## oh, she couldn't see the bird?
everyone else saw it.

## marina?
marina's looking the other way.

## so... how are we going to get down?
i...

## you scaled a thousand foot tower of ice, and you don't know how to get down?
of all the ungrateful...

## um... ropes?
uh... no.

## uh, grappling hooks?
yeah... no.

## your swords?
hey, i've got this.

## sinbad?
thank you for coming after me.

## is it the shore... or the sea?
i've always loved the sea.

## you really have to give it up?
yes.

## and is this what you always wanted?
not really.

## what was on the ship?
you.

## eh, sinbad, how how are we gonna pull this off?
sinbad...... you did it.

## huh?
now, now, my pets.

## is this any way to treat a guest?
okay, i'm severely creeped out.

## like it?
i'm planning on doing the whole world this way.

## what makes you think i have it?
uh, well, you framed me for the theft, so they would execute me.

## you?
yeah.

## you want to bet?
i'll tell you what.

## you still don't trust me?
uh... no.

## isn't it a pity we live in such skeptical times?
oh, all right.

## fair enough?
ask your question.

## if you don't get the book, will you go back to die?
i will go back.

## but could you love a man who would run away?
i bet you thought i wouldn't make it.

## the book?
i did my best.

## i told the truth.
how could i do anything else... my friend?

## you think?
king dymas.

## how much you got on you?
i offer you the gratitude of the twelve cities, and the apology of a king.

## how much?
sinbad.

## no fun if you're actually invited?
no, it's just, uh... there's a hammock in fiji with my name on it.

## and what happened to this woman?
she got her chance.

## hmm?
excuse me, captain.

## should we help him?
he's due in the lists in two minutes.

## eh?
three scores to none after two lances.

## what do you mean?
his life's spark is covered in shite.

## does that answer your question?
no, no, no.

## what's your name, william?
william thatcher, answer me with your name.

## do you want to eat or not?
if the nobles find out, there'll be the devil to pay.

## stand ye ready?
sir ector.

## ready?
i tilted against sir ector many times.

## for sir ector to shite himself to death?
get it in the cradle. ln the cradle.

## and technique?
i have a month to learn that.

## how did the nobles become noble in the first place?
they took it at the tip of a sword.

## but a full stomach?
that dream can come true.

## you see?
money doesn't matter.

## and you shouldn't.
see how hungry i am?

## hoy, sir.
how would it look if my squire rode while i walked?

## what are you doing?
uh... trudging.

## were you robbed?
interesting question.

## who are you?
lilium inter spinas.

## a what?
i write with ink and parchment.

## did you say patents of nobility?
that's right.

## and you gentlemen are?
i am sir ulrich von lichtenstein from gelderland.

## off to the tournament?
this is the road to rouen.

## would you speak to me?
ah, to speak.

## tell me your name.
would you care if i were ugly?

## and what would you do with my name, sir hunter?
call me a fox, for that is all i am to you.

## does this not shock you, ladies?
certainly, my lord.

## why, god, did you curse me with this face?
god's will has a purpose, but we may not know it.

## ulrich von lichtenstein?
i am simon the summoner.

## what are we supposed to do?
he assured us that you, his liege, would pay us.

## and who are you?
peter, a humble pardoner...... and purveyor of religious relics.

## how much does he owe?
we, on behalf of the lord god...... will take it from his flesh so that he may understand...... that gambling is a sin.

## please, will you help me, sir ulrich?
i promise you won't regret it.

## lsn't that why we're here?
come on.

## do you want to touch him?
we should've saved for the blacksmith.

## a woman?
beggars cannot be choosers, my lord.

## who?
the other armorers.

## did they say i couldn't do it because i'm a woman?
they said you're good with horseshoes, not armor.

## do you only pretend to fight, count adhemar, or wage real war as well?
i am leader of the free companies.

## what do you think of the joust?
it's very abrupt.

## do men die in the joust?
lance points are tipped with coronals, which blunts them.

## and you are?
i am, um....

## have you forgotten?
ulrich von lichtenstein from gelderland.

## what about it?
how stylish of you to wear an antique.

## was she watching?
geoff.

## did she see me?
yes, she did.

## did she see me take the hit?
yes.

## was she concerned?
her eyes welled up.

## how so?
the slit in the visor is narrow, but splinters can penetrate it.

## why didn't ulrich finish him?
he shows mercy.

## her name?
her name is aphrodite.

## would you have sir ulrich win the tournament for you?
william, here.

## a knight?
you might as well try to change the stars.

## can a man change the stars?
yes, william.

## have you enough clothes?
be gone.

## what on earth could you possibly do to us?
i will eviscerate you in fiction.

## so, what of it?
i could make armor you wouldn't even know you wore it.

## what's the cost?
just take me as far as paris.

## why are we leaving so soon?
the next tournament is in a week.

## my lady would know the color of your lord's tunic tonight.
let adhemar laugh at me again?

## his tunic?
yes, so she can dress to match him.

## what color is my tunic tonight?
green.

## you can hit me all day because you punch like a what?
of course.

## is there another way?
sir ulrich, you look fantastic.

## or a basse dance?
sir ulrich.

## why don't you show us a dance of your country?
show us a dance of gelderland.

## what?
i don't know.

## what are these?
the marks of my trade should another knight admire the armor.

## you okay?
i didn't feel a thing.

## who's that knight?
piers courtenay.

## you mad?
you endanger a royal family member.

## you knew me?
yeah.

## and still you rode?
it's not in me to withdraw.

## don't you get tired of putting on clothes?
she's talking about taking them off.

## a flower is only as good as its petals, no?
a flower is good for nothing.

## really?
you can't eat a flower.

## you're just a silly girl, aren't you?
better a silly girl with a flower than a silly boy with a horse and stick.

## what?
adhemar was called back to the free companies.

## was that wrong?
well, it's up to you, really.

## her breasts?
yes, you could, but i would tend to look above her breasts.

## i miss her throat?
still higher.

## the moon?
the moon.

## did she read the letter?
yes, and yes.

## did she give me a token?
she did.

## well, what is it?
give it to me.

## ulrich against every frenchman here?
he's won four tournaments in a row.

## shut your mouth, all right?
as sure as the sun will rise.

## don't you think?
it's beautiful.

## excuse me?
i'll win this tournament in your name.

## really? lts flanks?
i wish to hear poetry, ulrich.

## why must everything for a woman be run on a man's schedule?
well, a man's day is fuller, and...... he has more demands on his time.

## ls that so?
yes.

## no?
i demand poetry...... and when i want it.

## do you ask in earnest?
yes.

## what do you mean?
instead of winning to honor me with your high reputation...... act against your character and do badly.

## do badly?
i will not lose.

## what are you doing?
losing.

## i saw it, okay?
i know.

## proof of what?
her legs weren't uncrossed for nothing.

## it's very romantic, though.
then why are we doing this?

## are you a woman or a blacksmith?
sometimes i'm both.

## have you proven that yet?
wat, you remember church as a boy.

## isn't she watching?
forty eight...... forty nine...... and fifty.

## then who is?
my maid tells me that sometimes your varlets...... call you william.

## is this so, sir ulrich?
yes.

## how long since any of you have been back?
i've only been gone 6 months.

## william?
twelve.

## how long for?
seven years.

## sir ector?
i'm the thatcher.

## is this the boy?
well, he's a half starved little scarecrow.

## can you pack my horse and lead it?
well, come on.

## father?
i'm afraid.

## of what?
i won't know the way home.

## you put them in that order?
generally, with a few exceptions.

## a real thoroughbred trophy, don't you think?
you speak of her like a target.

## isn't she?
with a stick, while he slept.

## with a lance?
that man is unbeatable.

## what are you doing in cheapside?
there's no parade today.

## can you keep a secret?
i was born in cheapside, just around the corner there.

## truly, sir ulrich?
truly.

## how old are you?
nine and one half.

## you do?
yes.

## what do you mean?
he's blind, sir.

## is someone there?
if you're here for the net, i'm not done yet.

## who are you?
a knight.

## ulrich?
i hear that name being chanted from the stadium.

## what business have you here?
i have word, master thatcher.

## of my william?
well, come in, sir.

## does he live?
aye.

## has he found his way home at last?
yes.

## is there a certain one or many?
there is a certain one.

## somebody die?
sir ulrich von lichtenstein.

## so, what do you think...... now that you know what i am?
to know what you are, william, would take a lifetime.

## but love they cannot take.
but you'll see me run?

## with the pigs inside in winter?
yes, william, with the pigs.

## and you, geoff?
i wish it too, with all the pieces of my heart.

## you and l?
we aren't runners.

## ln what world could you have ever beaten me?
both trying to hide who we are.

## can you joust?
there's my tournament to finish.

## now, are you fit to compete, or shall the forfeit stand?
i'm fit.

## are you sure?
yes.

## in what world could you have ever beaten me?
such a place does not exist.

## about the prince and the knights?
no, all of it.

## okay, you ready for this?
as ever.

## jon bon jovi?
jon bon jovi.

## so give me a call, okay?
and i like to think that perhaps i am that kind of island.

## where was i gonna get that kind of money from?
maybe if i was like that movie kid, haley joel osment...... i could pay her that much.

## yeah, she's delightful, isn't she?
i know.

## isn't she?
to tell the truth, i'm being crap with her.

## how are you?
he's lovely.

## any desire for a family of your own yet?
i'd rather eat barney's nappies.

## what does that mean?
look at yourself.

## i mean, what is the point of your life?
bloody hell.

## seriously?
seriously.

## but what if i like walking you to school?
right.

## who are you?
i'm me.

## and what are you not?
a sheep.

## marcus?
i love you.

## something exciting?
i think so, yes.

## why do you say that?
god knows.

## what in god's name are you saying, you idiot?
she can't be buying this rubbish.

## you okay?
yes.

## you're breaking up with me?
you...... self centered bastard.

## why hadn't anyone told me about them before?
passionate sex, a lot of ego massage and a guilt free parting.

## can i have cocoa puffs?
no, it's not sunday.

## should i get my own breakfast?
no, i'm doing it.

## so, you looking forward to school today?
today, you'll need to effect...... the decimal point when you multiply it by 10...... 100 and 1000.

## are you going to computer club later?
spice girls or something.

## why not?
well, it's because of them.

## where did they hang out?
i'm a single father, i have a 2 year old boy.

## really?
yeah.

## yeah, i mean, obviously it was a very big shock...... because we were so happy, you know?
yeah.

## you got dumped then?
yeah.

## may i ask, does your ex see ned at all?
sorry, i didn't catch your name.

## how does he cope with that?
he's a very good little boy.

## they've got amazing resources, don't they?
yeah, he's very special.

## you okay?
yeah.

## trust me?
of course.

## ls that all right?
yeah.

## me?
there were too many lies to keep track of so i told the truth.

## what do you mean, before i did nothing?
yeah.

## you've never worked?
i've done the odd day here and there, but, no.

## crazy, isn't it?
it's....

## you know michael jackson?
he makes a 1, 000, 000 a minute.

## i was beginning to wonder if we'd be stuck with this weird kid all day.
how much then?

## so, what's this song then?
if you can live off it, we must've heard of it.

## do carol singers have to pay you 10 percent?
they should, but you can't always catch the little bastards.

## so, how often do you look after him?
my mum's homemade bread.

## i was only trying to feed it.
you miss him, don't you?

## is that your mum's bread?
you didn't have to throw the whole loaf.

## you the one who was throwing bloody great loaves at the ducks?
yeah, he was, but i've stopped him now.

## would you, marcus?
no.

## marcus?
mum.

## are you decent?
and a new part of my life started.

## where's the phone, mate?
it was horrible.

## listen, you know this has nothing to do with you, don't you?
i mean, you're not the reason that she....

## isn't that right, will?
yeah, that's right.

## just shut up, all right?
there you go, warm and flat.

## are you with fiona brewer?
yes, i'm her friend suzie.

## so, my place or yours?
sorry.

## it's a bit hard for you to love me when you're dead, isn't it?
i'm sorry.

## all that?
no, but...... at the moment, i feel better.

## what happens when i go back to school?
i can't be here to watch you all the time.

## three what?
nothing.

## how do people cram them in?
yeah, will here.

## pardon?
it's marcus.

## marcus?
marcus.

## how'd you get my number?
from suzie.

## and why did you think that, marcus?
suzie said we hit it off.

## did she?
yeah.

## i said what?
see you soon.

## remember?
this is soon, all right, marcus.

## why?
i thought you did nothing.

## what's that noise?
that's a lawn mower.

## why shouldn't i take the poor little sod out for a meal?
i could be uncle will.

## why should i?
we're poor.

## remember where we live?
flat 2, 31 craysfield road, islington, london, n12sf.

## i mean, how are you feeling?
my stomach's fine.

## this kind of thing doesn't go away overnight, does it?
no.

## did you know in burma you get seven years in prison for telling jokes?
next time you laugh, think of pa pa lay, the burmese standup comedian.

## and what's your boyfriend say about that?
wait a minute.

## you say you haven't got a boyfriend?
talk about human rights violations.

## you're in the bath now?
you have to mean things to help people.

## what are you on about?
no, you don't.

## what is it to you, anyway?
nothing.

## can i come in?
no.

## what are you doing?
i'm watching tv.

## want to help?
no, that's not what i meant.

## i meant, why don't you go home and do your homework?
i'll do you a deal.

## you'd want your mum to go out with someone like me?
you're not too bad.

## what's wrong with her?
yeah.

## mum, did you always know i was going to be a vegetarian?
yeah, of course i did.

## what, when you were born?
i do the cooking and i don't want to cook meat.

## is this premature teenage rebellion?
i can't stop you from going to mcdonald's.

## you mean my mum?
yeah.

## are you decent?
every single day.

## what was your dad like?
a bit sad, really.

## is that what the guitar's for?
the ones trying to embed sweets into your skull.

## does this happen often?
they never chucked sweets before, they just thought of that.

## and singing?
sometimes i sing out loud without noticing.

## i'm not going to do it on purpose, am i?
i'm not stupid, you know.

## one machine in your kitchen is an invisible machine?
i don't think so.

## it happens, and i wish it didn't, but that's life, isn't it?
there's nothing i can do about it.

## everything all right?
yeah, thanks.

## pretty trendy, your old man, isn't he?
there.

## you think you look cool, don't you?
don't know.

## do you think i look cool?
they stole them.

## why would anyone want to steal your shoes?
i could see i had to tell the truth.

## where did you get cool new trainers?
she had loads more questions.

## the guy who took us to lunch?
yeah.

## he's sort of become your friend?
she kept repeating the last thing i said.

## where does he live?
he's not there at the moment.

## why is that, christine?
most people need something in their lives to keep them afloat...... and you have absolutely nothing.

## do you know what you want?
hi.

## you didn't tell your mum that you've been coming round?
i think i forgot.

## what are you doing with my son?
wait a minute.

## what are you suggesting here?
nothing.

## listen, don't worry about it.
what?

## i won't open the door to marcus again, okay?
i'll be glad to be rid of the pair of you, frankly.

## so that's it, is it?
you're just out of his life, like that.

## excuse me?
let's say you're right and i'm wrong.

## what are you going to do about it?
no, marcus, i do not want to come over for bloody christmas.

## isn't that cool, will?
it's a cd, marcus.

## and what kind of music is mystikal?
it's sort of world music.

## is he moroccan?
i'm afraid we haven't got a cd player.

## marcus, is this a joke?
no, come on in.

## where's megan?
at her dad's.

## at his mum's for christmas?
yeah.

## i should probably go, shouldn't i?
you could go pose as santa, try and shag some carol singers.

## she's right, marcus.
are you a professional santa?

## just leave it, okay?
all he did was make up a kid for a couple weeks.

## he bought me trainers, he lets me go round to his house and he knows what kids need.
so what?

## expensive footwear and obscene music?
if there's something you really need then we can talk about it.

## remember why?
because you threw a loaf of bread at a duck's head and killed it, basically.

## okay.
excuse me?

## am i in television?
no.

## so what do you do?
i'm sort of taking a bit of time off at the moment.

## time off from what?
to be absolutely honest, time off from time off, in fact.

## you don't do anything?
actually, no.

## east coast or west coast rap?
i have absolutely no....

## or was there?
i tell you what.

## really?
yes.

## yeah?
yeah.

## mine?
he's called marcus.

## you like rap?
a little.

## you taking a piss?
i'm not taking a piss.

## what's your name?
marcus.

## and where will that get us?
and stop telling strangers to shake their ass.

## why did you tell this lady i was your son?
no, i didn't tell her.

## why not?
we're really going around in circles here.

## just accept the facts, okay?
you're my son.

## for christ's sake!
that's a load of shit.

## what's so interesting about her?
okay, marcus, here.

## okay?
i don't know.

## what's the difference between a girl who's your friend and a girlfriend?
well, i don't know.

## yeah, you've heard about sex, right?
it is kind of a big deal.

## okay, how do i look?
good.

## just be as normal as you can, okay?
good advice for marcus.

## ali?
all i could do was stand there, grinning like an idiot.

## should we just go upstairs?
sure.

## really?
yeah, i think i've seen you around.

## yeah, sounds good, right?
i'm not really sure it's up to me.

## yeah, it's just that i can't really do much at the moment, can i?
i mean, will, that's my dad...... he likes your mum, and i think she's keen on him.

## am i boring you?
no, no.

## what?
nothing.

## did i?
i think it's sweet how much he seems to take after you...... and the way he dresses like you, as well.

## he said he'd cut me up into little pieces and hide me under the floorboards.
marcus?

## he did?
no.

## doesn't he?
sorry, marcus.

## don't you, mate?
no.

## yeah, but i didn't know that then, did i, sexy?
all i'm saying is, you know, watch out.

## what does that mean?
it's just that you and rachel....

## what does that mean?
i don't know, i think there's a problem with you and rachel.

## if you're going to be with someone...... shouldn't you tell them things like that?
no.

## what's wrong with you?
but later that night, when i was on my own...... i remembered the deal marcus was prepared to strike.

## would he be buying me shoes soon?
i took his advice and told rachel the truth.

## if you're not his natural father...... and you don't live with him, then how is he your son?
yeah, i see.

## you want some chinese rice wine, miss?
you would like to try, i suspect, the panang paneng.

## yeah?
no.

## did i?
it's what you chose to believe.

## yes?
i didn't know what the answer was.

## at the rock concert?
i don't think that would be a very good idea, marcus.

## will you accompany me?
all i've got is a tambourine.

## at what?
sorry.

## what do you mean, what?
the crying.

## didn't you hear me?
i heard you.

## what do you want me to do about it?
i don't know.

## who am i to her?
i'm nobody.

## who do you think you are?
you come here uninvited, you disrupt my life, you screw things up.

## what do you want from me?
this isn't my problem.

## we've established pretty firmly that i'm not your father, either, am i?
but....

## i'm the guy who's really good at choosing trainers or records, okay?
that's it.

## how could you?
you're a stupid person who watches tv all day...... and buys things.

## who?
he's a load of crap.

## you made him up?
yeah.

## yeah, well, that's the thing, isn't it?
it's not.

## you don't?
not at the moment, no.

## what are you on about?
no.

## what are you, nuts?
right.

## what?
no.

## what?
marcus is singing at the school concert.

## marcus is singing?

no, you're not a bad mother.

## what?
hi.

## what are you doing here?
that's ali up there.

## what is going on here?
nothing.

## what are you doing here?
i heard you were about to commit social suicide, so i dropped by.

## look, mate, nothing you do can make your mum happy, all right?
not in the long term.

## what, you think those people out there are going to make you happy?
hang on.

## was i frightened?
i was petrified.

## you think so?
yeah.

## mcdonald's?
yeah.

## below the surface of the ocean they're actually connected.

## you think she's up for it?
i used to want him to marry my mum.

## you serious?
yeah.

## how do you use this blender thing?
you don't.

## so how do you know will?

## what's wrong with them?
nothing.

## what?
by the way, i do think you and rachel have a shot.

## can you hit the basement button, please?
those stickers they put on apples.

## what you're getting so bad out of shape for, man?
i mean, it's just a girl.

## what do you mean?
i mean you're the kind of guy... who likes those silhouettes of naked women on the mud flaps of trucks.

## what's that on your hand?
it's penile power, man.

## like i always say...
i got it out of an ad in a magazine, you know?

## what's that have to do with anything?
no, man, look here.

## this is kung chang, right?
whatever, man.

## so what are you gonna do about this girl?
you don't want a girlfriend.

## for centuries, we've been killing over 15 years before our wives... and all because of all the stress in the work place, right?
but not once have they apologized, man... for all the millions of years of life we've lost working... while women stayed home.

## what are you doing, man?
rod, i focused all my great cerebral powers... to come up with this bold plan to penetrate the vault.

## coyote super genius or something?
something like that.

## i just hoped to get in... a few verbal punches before he went mike tyson on me.
what you mean, you just wanna be friends?

## who are you?
i'm matthew.

## natural born hipster?
the next evolution of a jock.

## what was the worse?
i'm here so save her.

## how are you gonna do that?
crick wasn't wearing a shirt.

## you're patty, huh?
you do that comic in the school newspaper.

## is that what you call me?
no, i wasn't calling you anything. in high school, you would have called me a slut.

## what's wrong?
nothing, i'm sorry.

## are these stress balls?
to relieve tension, like humphrey bogart did in that old movie.

## what?
pinball balls.

## really?
0kay, i'm sorry, i have to go.

## what's the matter with you?
penile power.

## so what's plan b, mr. coyote?
i'm gonna continue searching.

## you're matt, the maintenance guy, right?
i need some help in my room.

## how can a guy have a real conversation with a girl like this... when we're made so helpless?
in the animal kingdom, when 2members stare at each other... it is a test of dominance.

## anybody for a game of foosball?
no, thanks.

## what if she saw me getting beaten by a girl?
it's goal time.

## man, you lost to a girl?
yeah, and my pride shrank like my scrotum on a snow day.

## what do you mean?
take the breasts, for example.

no, there's too many choices.

## you see that girl?
i call her ever tan barbara.

## who's the girl with the magic markers up there?
it's ren.

## see next door?
that's sasha.

## have you seen that girl at the front desk, rhonda?

she's always on the phone crying with her long distance boyfriend.

## who's that girl with the green slime, man?
you've found dana.

## and who's the hummer on three?
that's michelle.

## so, have you got any more suspicious suspects yet?
i have that one girl who never comes out of her room.

## who can give me examples?
the pope won't allow women priests.

## why women shoes are always so uncomfortable?
an older man can go out with a young woman, but an older woman...... can't go out with a young man.

## you enrolled in my class to meet girls, didn't you?
there's a couple of you every semester.

## i wanna let you know, we're gonna be doing the lights today, okay?
i just want to let you know that you're hair looks really cute.

## hear me out, man.
don't you get it?

## but what about us?
we live with the disappointment that our women won't look like it.

## they ever take that in consideration?
i wonder what prom night succubus or second date siren... had in stilled him such zealous misogyny.

## where do you start when you measure your dick, man?
i was just checking to make sure the paper printed my ad.

## you sit in the dark every thursday night?
you're a sick man.

## she didn't come, did she?
no.

## how did you know i was down here?
i read your personal ad.

## what?
you're just so perfect.

## so i hid under my covers. is it not sad to be so afraid of your father?
i was really scared of the wizard of 0z.

## that margaret hamilton... who does the wicked witch was so hair raising, you know?
and that music... it scared me so much.

## sometimes, do you know what i did to calm myself?
i remembered that dorothy killed the witch by putting water on her.

## i just told you a sad story about my family, and that's all you can say?
i'm sorry.

## why is that?
the force is strong with this one.

## can you blame guys for being so horny?
look at the dress.

## so, as francesca, try to make one of them... reveal that she had sex on an elevator in a black out.
foxy lady!

## did i ever tell you about when i got a bloody nose while giving head?
0nce i got my gum stuck in the guy's pubis while giving a blow job.

## have any of you ever tried that?
i have it.

## so, why is it purple?
it's fake and processed, just like america.

## tell me something... who's the idiot who invented the buttoned down fly?
there are dogs who sniff melanoma in humans before it's diagnosed.

## like hurricane andrew?
you never hear giuseppe or mohammed.

## do you know what the best phrase is?
i can't speak to cynthia as matt.

## can i ask you a question?
yeah.

## how often do you bikini wax?
i'm not stupid.

## who?
never mind.

## so ready to go again?
it's just easier to talk to cynthia as a girl than as a guy.

## how do you mean?
when you're a guy talking to a girl like her, you're going for all the marbles.

## what are you reading?
nothing.

## why are you talking to me?
i don't know.

## what's your name?
ghost face.

## what?
they called me so in high school.

## 0r are you chicken?
our grudge match escalated into a cold war of words.

## we're always picking after you.
and a person is an extension of a woman's vagina?

## wedding gifts are a demonstration of that.
why are you so worked up?

## what all the newly weds get?
it's not.

## how about that?
she's up there.

## why aren't you doing anything?
she does this every semester.

## why are you doing this?
i was born with the greatest curse.

## what's that?
i'm ugly and i'm also very smart.

## can you imagine someone being that passionate for you?
your turn.

## he feels something, doesn't he?
the reminiscence of my big prick.

## what happened?
last night, my roommate, rod, came to find me.

## what are you talking about?
no, you got me wrong.

## what?
0live soup.

## so he was all ready to do it with you?
it proves men are irresponsible when it comes to genital gymnastics.

## shopping?
women have more practice at it.

## care to come in and share a bowl of captain crunch?
no, i have work to do.

## how do you know i like some other girl?
by the way that you look at me.

## and how is that?
there's a certain way a man stares at the woman he loves.

## you know how captain hook could always hear the crocodile... from the tic tac of his clock in the crock's belly?
that's the way it was for me with crick and his nicotine gum.

## the bad guys of the world really know they're being bad... or they think they're good guys when they act like sphincters?
i don't know.

## so you think you're a good guy?
i know i am.

## cool?
that's another thing that bothers me.

## what was that?
my pinball balls.

## you had them in while eating?
yeah, it's incredible.

## you're sure there's not another ball in there?
no, here.

## did i tell you i'm up to 15 pounds over here?
i treated her like she was my sexual training wheels... something i'd use to learn and i'd discard when i no longer need them.

## and what if the elevator girl finds out?
she's gonna think i'm a dick.

## why should it be any different for you?
you should embrace your destiny, not deny it.

## how are you gonna get by with this attitude towards women, rod?
i'm gonna get rich.

## what happened to make you hate women so much?
there's no problem.

## what's your horror story?
there's no story, man.

## what girl?
francesca.

## stop trying to find me.
matthew?

## what?
i don't want you to find me.

## can we talk about this for a second?
there's nothing to talk about.

## do you wanna talk about it?
no, i'm okay.

## what do you think i am?
it's midnight and i'm cleaning my room.

## is your mom coming tomorrow?
yeah, you guessed it.

## really?
hi, mom.

## another point, pussies?
forget it.

## what do you mean?
i can blame my father a little bit.

## how is that supposed to teach me to be a man, right?
i wouldn't say that.

## see?
you're beautiful.

## so, cynthia, why aren't you out on a saturday night?
because my face got flattened like road kill after the couch fell on me.

## so what are you reading?
this guy was supposed to give me his notes, but he never called me.

## then why does he let bad things happen to good people?
i don't know.

## so francesca went to hangout with her.
i guess god has a plan for everybody, right?

## so what do you think about that maintenance guy matt?
he's not my type really.

## why is that?
i don't know.

## you want to some of me too?
it looks like it's just the two of us.

## are you a slut too?
everything will be fine.

## do you like it?
i'm gonna give it to you good.

## what do y'all think the deal is with those clowns?
i don't know, but we're not expecting supplies.

## what can i do for you?
you're closing me down.

## so, how long we got?
just as long as it takes to cap that well and get your crew on the plane.

## yeah?
well, just watch me.

## really?
well, somebody somewhere thinks that you did.

## kelly, right?
yeah, right.

## you ladies calm down.
davis, what are you doing?

## you want to try pushing me into my seat?
you must be rodney.

## i'm gonna want it back.
didn't that rig get shut down too?

## we're all set?
looks like we got one more.

## anybody know who this guy is?
it's a long story.

## well, why change a good thing?
go ahead, good buddy.

## you gonna kiss your lucky man?
i'll make it happen right now.

## you wanna see my family, bro?
she look familiar.

## what do you want to do?
try kissing that lucky man again.

## what the hell was that?
that was the aerial, frank.

## what was that noise just now?
i believe you're too heavy.

## will you deal with this?
we'll go around it.

## any stations copy?
we got no response.

## right?
just as soon as the storm is over.

## they know where to look for us?
we don't have the same kind of radar tracking we have in the states.

## well, there's no harm in trying, is there?
you never know.

## why is it his fault?
all that stuff about jinxes.

## captain?
i don't think i'm the right person.

## what the hell do they expect me to say?
i don't even know those guys.

## you're looking to join those two?
keep it up.

## who, him?
yeah.

## blew in in the middle of the mongolian desert?
well, the good news is that besides the powdered eggs... all the food's been canned in water or juice.

## so how screwed are we?
pretty screwed.

## we're still in mongolia?
i'll just take this map.

## how old is that map, captain?
too old, the way the sand shifts around here all the time.

## oh, man.
you know what?

## kelly.
hello?

## you seen davis this morning?
knowing him, he's still sleeping.

## well?
his stuff s all here.

## not another word from you.
could he?

## what kind of odds do you give us a search party's gonna find us?
about five percent.

## as opposed to what?
trying to figure a way out of here.

## the pipe jacket in the back what's it all worth?
i don't know, alex.

## don't you think they'd do the same thing before mounting a search for us?
add it up.

## and and while the port area we will still have to redesign the tail section.
what's going on here?

## what the hell is he talking about?
he's talking about building a new airplane.

## i think a bee stung you on your big dumb ass head.
yeah, why didn't i think of that?

## what do you know about airplanes?
sizemore and pratt.

## and you understand that engine's got a 2, 000 pound thrust?
yes.

## so?
when it gets started, it's gonna tear your bee apart.

## why the hell not?
get us out of here.

## so what do you think we should do?
nothing.

## where's liddle?
oh, shit.

## has anybody seen liddle?
he's definitely not in here.

## no one else dies, remember?
i'll go.

## yeah?
throw me that canteen.

## you okay?
it's a long shot.

## why give people false hope?
you're assuming i'm one of those people who has hopes and dreams.

## look, how could i let those people build that plane... when i don't believe it'll work?
i think a man only needs one thing in life.

## how do i know you're not full of shit?
here.

## what?
nothing.

## by what?
that during these dire times... you take the time to thank god for anything.

## well, we're still alive, aren't we?
there you go.

## why?
i'm glad that you've finally seen the light, mr. towns.

## are you kidding me?
i'd do anything to avoid another hopes and dreams speech.

## i'm gonna need some help.
okay, gentlemen, our our first task is to separate the wing here... so so we can join it with the main fuselage, okay?

## there you go.
make sure they're good and tight, ian, eh?

## aah!

## you got it, rod?
hang on.

## how much water did we drink?
too much.

## you okay?
when i was out there, when i found liddle...

## yeah?
i saw something pretty weird.

## yeah?
i found shell casings all around his body.

## just keep that to yourself, all right?
screw that.

## we're gonna have to work during the day.
yeah!

## and what kind of hole is that gonna put us in with the h2o?
we're gonna run out before we even finish the damn plane.

## okay?
for that, sammi, we need you.

## you sure you know what to do?
yeah, i think so.

## yeah, no pressure on me, right?
just a little bit.

## what am i doing?
i'm a chef.

## oh, sammi.
yeah.

## see?
piece of cake.

## what's the problem?
oh, just sending an e mail to an old friend.

## we gotta get out of here.
what?

## what?
the storm it's electrical.

## i don't understand your problem.
so what?

## you don't understand?
yeah.

## final answer?
final answer.

## is that spelled right?
hey.

## you planning on shooting someone, a. j.?
while you've all been sleeping...

## why didn't you just ask?
because i'm in charge of building my plane... and i don't need to ask anyone anything.

## should we go over there and find out?
whatever you wanna do, frank.

## did you hear what i just said?
we got this, elliott.

## why me?
because you know most of the local dialects.

## you do?
hold on.

## and who's gonna look after yours?
screw this.

## what's he saying to me?
they want to know where the plane is.

## what's going on?
i'm not sure.

## alex?
look at me.

## it's okay.
how much water?

## you found any water?
we didn't know what else to do.

## and why not?
these bastards killed rodney.

## he can't stay around here.
why don't you just offer him your watch while you at it, asshole?

## well, where are we gonna take him?
pick his ass up and drag him back where you found him at.

## what s your address?
hey, liz.

## what?

yes.

stu's listening in.

## pam, i'm afraid stu hasn't been totally honest with you.
stu, is that true?

## what do you mean?
don't do this.

## now, why would a man who has a cell phone...... call you every day from a phone booth?
because he said it's quiet.

## i've never seen her but she sounds lovely. why do you think he invites you to the city hotel?
cheap rooms for cheap girls.

## i know that, okay?
i may be from montana, but we have men there also.

## you're calling me crazy?
no, you're going through a difficult time.

## stu, do you really think that i'm an actor?
i'm not an actor.

## i'm doing it.
so are you going to call kelly and tell her about pam?

## feeling kind of nervous, stu?
hello.

## stu?
yeah.

## where are you?
i'm in a phone booth.

## he just called me a hooker.
who's that woman?

## are you sure there's nothing wrong?
we are escorts.

## can you just come over to the store so we can talk in person?
i feel kind of weird.

## you didn't tell your wife the truth, did you, stu?
and you can tell she really loves you.

## why screw up her life?
she never did you harm.

## what are you going to do about it with your goddamn binoculars?
i never said i had binoculars.

## you mean like a rifle?
a. 30 caliber bolt action 700 with a carbon one modification...... and a state of the art hensholdt tactical scope.

at this range, the exit wound ought to be about the size of a small tangerine.

## now, doesn't that just torque your jaws?
i love that.

## now why didn't he have it cocked?
because that sound is scary.

## it's cool, isn't it?
look, you shoot a gun here and there'll be pandemonium.

## do you think so?
let's see.

## stu, you still with me?
stand up and be a man.

## so do you mean you would whack me for no particular reason?
no, i have plenty of reasons, and you keep giving me more.

## you do have a sensitive side.
shall i take care of him?

## how much to let me go?
let's see how sensitive you really are.

## can you feel it, the heat of it?
come now, stu, you can feel it.

## you read about the german porn king shot 10 days ago...... at 38th and 8th?
he thought he was an artist and wouldn't admit he was just a pedophile.

## below the shoulder. which one?

## you're doing so much better than the others. what do you remember about those killings, stu?
i don't know. well, you think of yourself as a smart guy, stu.

## i don't know, all right?
okay, i'll give you a hint. wallets, watches, everything was left on their bodies.

## why me?
if you have to ask, then you're not ready to know yet.

## you got any idea how much pain you're making in my life?
hey, look at me.

## you know why?
leon, he told us to fuck off.

## so i'm saying this once, nice, all right?
it's like nails on a chalkboard.

## you're gonna give me $ 120 to rent the booth the bums piss in?
yeah, i'm a nice guy.

## how long you want to rent the booth?
indefinitely.

## indefinitely?
yes.

## do i look like an asshole?

## whose street is this?
that's right, baby.

## baby, you bleeding?
you must've cut yourself...

## what's wrong?
you cut yourself.

## you shot him.
what's wrong?

## why'd you fucking shoot him?
if you had dealt with the man decently, this might not have been necessary.

## and what is it you do?
i watch.

## yes, well, what else is there to do...... when life turns on you and you've retreated into some small room?
you look out your window.

## are you in need of immediate police or medical response?
shit.

## that why you killed leon?
i didn't kill leon because of the way he dressed.

## did they dress too nice?
you must feel really expensive when you walk out the door.

## run?
no, i'm not a coward like some people i know.

## yeah, what if they open fire?
look around you, stu.

## you call this safe?
i got a whole fucking precinct here with guns pointed my way.

## suicide by a cop?
well, that's not gonna happen.

## vietnam?
yes, vietnam.

## i'm gonna go talk to him.
napalm charred bodies?

## shouldn't we wait on the esu negotiator?
they could take 20 minutes.

## what's yours?
i don't want to be friends.

## is that who you're talking to on the phone?
look, i just want to hear your side of it.

## you see a fucking gun anywhere?
look.

## sir, do you have the weapon in your pocket?
no.

## you want to see it?
mustn't tell him, stu.

## who do you keep talking to on the phone?
nobody.

## who?
careful, stuart.

## what's this doctor's name?
it would be really helpful to us if we knew.

## he says not to tell you, all right?
it's privileged information.

## all i want to know is, what happened, man?
tell him to read you your rights.

## so now, can you at least give me your first name?
just your first name.

## all right?
i want an attorney brought down here to negotiate my surrender.

## you won't let me put my hand in my pocket?
we'll take it out for you.

## what?
ask him a question.

## are you gonna step out of the booth?
i can't.

## you're not stepping out of the booth?
ask him.

## both your lives depend on it.
is that a no?

## does he masturbate on lonely nights?
yes.

## should we give ourselves up?
maybe i'd like someone to negotiate my surrender.

## i mean, you've got connections, right?
sure.

## diane sawyer?
look, i, i, i don't know.

## what about yours?
look, it's our friends from channels two and five.

## can you tap into that phone call?
should be no problem.

## look, tracing, that's not a violation, right?
as long as we don't listen in.

## we get that?
i want somebody to find out what's going on.

## right?
think about it.

## listen, this could be a media frenzy, all right?
you'd get barbara walters...... i mean, larry king if you still wanted him.

## all right?
in a city where nobody looks out for anybody, you took a stand.

## so you want me to trust you to get me out of this?
yes, i do.

## or do you want to leave this to a professional?
until a professional gets here, i'll handle it.

## this is what i want to do, okay?
this is the city hotel here.

## not going to answer it?
i can't.

## how can you be so sure?
it's you.

## yeah?
this lady says the perp's her husband.

## who do you think he's talking to?
i don't know.

## did this upset him, that you were talking to other men?
yes, he did seem a little upset, but it's, no...

## who's his psychiatrist?
he doesn't have one.

## captain?
if you can think of any dispute he's having currently, please, tell me.

## what about that wire tap?
we're working on it.

## you gotta hold tight a while, all right?
yeah, no problem.

## does he like being called stuart or stu?
stu.

## can you just talk to me?
yes, here's a photograph of us together.

no, we don't have a lawyer.

## okay?
i'm gonna get your husband out alive.

## you okay?
yeah, i'm fine.

## what?
but beautiful women always know.

## you talking about kelly?
that false indifference, superior air...... it's just a tease.

## they want eyes on them. why does she put on her makeup, do her hair, dress so nicely?
not for her husband that she hardly ever sees.

## what are you doing?
stay away from her.

## leave her out of this.
right?

## how many times...... have you had sex with pam in that hotel bedroom in your head? would you really miss kelly if she was gone?
that's it.

## your choices put other people in jeopardy. when are you gonna learn that?
this is funny.

## still gonna give me the silent treatment?
hello.

## yes?
i'm listening.

## okay?
that's all i did.

## interlock your fingers behind your head.
esu, esu?

## answer it.
okay?

## i want her in the car.
what the fuck are you doing?

## so can we start over?
you lied.

## okay?
i want you to do it quickly, and i want you to do it quietly.

## where's the esu sergeant?
you said we could go.

## besides the fear of death?
i dive out and you've got one shot.

## you think you can get me?
i could go for some target practice.

## what's up next to the florescent bulb?
check it out, stu.

## you'd shoot me if you got the chance, wouldn't you?
with a big fucking smile on my face.

## see the pink curtains?
because it's fun.

## isn't that what you wanted?
you know where i am, and you have a gun.

## who?
the motel.

## let's just see what he does, all right?
let's see what he's doing.

## how do you figure?
you get to choose between them.

## should i choose?
one of them can take your place.

## blond or brunette?
time's running out.

## stop this.
you or them?

## you're looking at a suicide on national fucking tv.
i can't take this anymore. what are you doing?

## you gonna let me take this over?
tell everybody to hold on, to hold their fire.

## what're you doing?
you liked how she sounded on the phone at the store.

## okay, how does this end?
tell me how this ends.

## what about that phone call to your store?
i got a phone call this afternoon.

## how long will it take to get a record of her calls?
if he's using that secure line, we won't know more than now.

## it would be safer if you got back in the car, okay?
please get back in the car.

## want me to clear the streets?
yeah.

## let's not let him know we know too much, okay?
i don't know.

## you wanna wake up, stu?
i wanna, but i got issues i can't talk about.

## that your psychiatrist on the phone?
yeah, yeah.

## it was liberating, right?
should've been.

## you trust me, stu?
get this man a seat on oprah.

## what the fuck do you want?
it's my world.

## all right?
never.

## you got some bad news on that call?
the worst.

## okay?
that's it.

## so this is all some religious thing?
that explains it.

## kill myself?
yes.

## all this shit just to watch me die?
no.

## everything?
no.

## anything?
no, not yet.

## okay?
stuart, i'm offering you a chance to redeem yourself.

## what, you couldn't find anyone worse than me?
not a murderer or a child molester but a publicist...... who has fantasies about pretty little actresses.

## these are my crimes?
stuart, i know your crimes.

## somebody got a 20 on this pam?
don't blame her.

## then why the confession?
i didn't do it for you.

## you got a room?
604.

## i can't stop lying?
they're coming up the stairs.

## there's nobody there?
they're coming through that fucking door to put you out of your misery.

## what're you gonna do?
since kelly is the most important thing in your life, i'll take her.

## what's his condition?
critical.

## your wife's fine, all right?
all right, try not to sit up.

## what hit me?
rubber bullet.

## did you get him?
you did.

## are you okay?
it's okay.

## sure you can hold on?
i gotta see him.

## you recognize him?

## you ever heard of delivering a pizza to a phone booth?
i don't think so.

## what am i supposed to do with the pie?
it's all paid for.

## get off the fucking pizza, all right?
that language is uncalled for.

## well, it's quitting time, right?
thank god, we were mobbed today.

## so how's your day?
it's getting better by the minute, sweetheart.

## who's the most famous person you publicized today?
you.

## really?
i told a few columnists mel gibson was looking for actresses for his film.

## are you mad?
don't worry about it.

## what?
big kiss.

## what?
i hope you realize how you've hurt my feelings.

## who the fuck is this?
don't think about leaving that phone.

## who is this?
someone who enjoys watching you.

## watching me?
yes, i love the suit you're wearing today.

## where are you?
there are hundreds of windows out there.

## so, what am i doing now?
you're scratching your head.

## who's stu?
i don't know any stu.

## why, do you prefer stuart?
a lot of people in this neighborhood know me.

## what's the matter, stu?
if you're some fucked up, failed actor i wouldn't handle...... or some prick intern i fired, i will hunt you down and i will crush you.

## am i upsetting you?
hello.

## pay you off or something?
tell me what you want.

## did adam at my office put you up to this?
no, i thought this up all by myself.

## what the...?
the callback feature cannot be activated...

## are you an actor?
yes.

## auditions?
you're not an agent.

## really?
yeah.

## no?
lucky you then, because i wrote it down.

## hi, who's this?
it's a good friend of stu's.

## you know stu?
i know he lies.

## who is this?
don't worry about that.

## pam, i'm afraid stu hasn't been totally honest with you.
stu, is that true?

## what do you mean?
don't do this.

## now, why would a man who has a cell phone...... call you every day from a phone booth?
because he said it's quiet.

## why do you think he invites you to the city hotel?
cheap rooms for cheap girls.

## i know that, okay?
i may be from montana, but we have men there also.

## hello?
back to you, stu.

## go away?
hang up the phone, nigga.

## did i...?
now, let's call kelly.

## how the fuck do you know all this shit?
speed dial her.

## why don't you try the truth?
you're cheating.

## then what do you call it?
look, you're a guy...... sometimes you want to know it's a possibility.

## do you hear what i'm saying?
kelly is a home and pam is a motel.

## you're calling me crazy?
no, you're going through a difficult time.

## stu, do you really think that i'm an actor?
i'm not an actor.

## i'm doing it.
so are you going to call kelly and tell her about pam?

## feeling kind of nervous, stu?
hello.

## stu?
yeah.

## where are you?
i'm in a phone booth.

## he just called me a hooker.
who's that woman?

## are you sure there's nothing wrong?
we are escorts.

## can you just come over to the store so we can talk in person?
i feel kind of weird.

## you didn't tell your wife the truth, did you, stu?
and you can tell she really loves you.

## why screw up her life?
she never did you harm.

## what are you going to do about it with your goddamn binoculars?
i never said i had binoculars.

## you mean like a rifle?
a. 30 caliber bolt action 700 with a carbon one modification...... and a state of the art hensholdt tactical scope.

## yeah, how's my fucking hair?
at this range, the exit wound ought to be about the size of a small tangerine.

## now, doesn't that just torque your jaws?
i love that.

## now why didn't he have it cocked?
because that sound is scary.

## it's cool, isn't it?
look, you shoot a gun here and there'll be pandemonium.

## do you hear me?
there will be cops all over this block.

## do you think so?
let's see.

## stu, you still with me?
stand up and be a man.

## so do you mean you would whack me for no particular reason?
no, i have plenty of reasons, and you keep giving me more.

## you do have a sensitive side.
shall i take care of him?

## how much to let me go?
let's see how sensitive you really are.

## can you feel it, the heat of it?
come now, stu, you can feel it.

## you read about the german porn king shot 10 days ago...... at 38th and 8th?
he thought he was an artist and wouldn't admit he was just a pedophile.

## please, tell me, where am i aiming now?
below the shoulder.

## which one?
the right shoulder.

## what do you remember about those killings, stu?
i don't know.

## i don't know, all right?
okay, i'll give you a hint.

## why me?
if you have to ask, then you're not ready to know yet.

## you got any idea how much pain you're making in my life?
hey, look at me.

## you know why?
leon, he told us to fuck off.

## so i'm saying this once, nice, all right?
it's like nails on a chalkboard.

## you're gonna give me $ 120 to rent the booth the bums piss in?
yeah, i'm a nice guy.

## how long you want to rent the booth?
indefinitely.

## indefinitely?
yes.

## do i look like a asshole?
let me tell you something. $500 gets you indefinitely.

## do you need help?
he looks very angry.

## yeah?
i got a gold rolex, motherfucker.

## can you hear me?
yes.

## whose street is this?
that's right, baby.

## baby, you bleeding?
you must've cut yourself...

## what's wrong?
you cut yourself.

## you shot him.
what's wrong?

## why'd you fucking shoot him?
if you had dealt with the man decently, this might not have been necessary.

## you shoot the guy, and i'm fucking responsible?
well, looked that way from up here.

## and what is it you do?
i watch.

## yes, well, what else is there to do...... when life turns on you and you've retreated into some small room?
you look out your window.

## what was so interesting about a guy in a phone booth on 53rd and 8th?
i'm trying to help you, stu, but you won't help yourself.

## what fucking deception?
shit.

## that why you killed leon?
i didn't kill leon because of the way he dressed.

## did they dress too nice?
you must feel really expensive when you walk out the door.

## run?
no, i'm not a coward like some people i know.

## yeah, what if they open fire?
they won't.

## do you see the tourists with the video cameras?
don't worry, they'll keep the police on their best behavior.

## you call this safe?
i got a whole fucking precinct here with guns pointed my way.

## i give the orders here, stu, don't i?
this guy is looking for us to kill him, captain.

## suicide by a cop?
well, that's not gonna happen.

## vietnam?
yes, vietnam.

## i'm gonna go talk to him.
why don't you wake up?

## shouldn't we wait on the esu negotiator?
they could take 20 minutes.

## what's yours?
i don't want to be friends.

## is that who you're talking to on the phone?
look, i just want to hear your side of it.

## you see a fucking gun anywhere?
look.

## sir, do you have the weapon in your pocket?
no.

## you want to see it?
mustn't tell him, stu.

## who do you keep talking to on the phone?
nobody.

## who?
careful, stuart.

## what's this doctor's name?
it would be really helpful to us if we knew.

## he says not to tell you, all right?
it's privileged information.

## all i want to know is, what happened, man?
tell him to read you your rights.

## so now, can you at least give me your first name?
just your first name.

## all right?
i want an attorney brought down here to negotiate my surrender.

## you won't let me put my hand in my pocket?
we'll take it out for you.

## what?
ask him a question.

## are you gonna step out of the booth?
i can't.

## you're not stepping out of the booth?
ask him.

## both your lives depend on it.
is that a no?

## does he masturbate on lonely nights?
yes.

## should we give ourselves up?
maybe i'd like someone to negotiate my surrender.

## i mean, you've got connections, right?
sure.

## why the fuck would larry king come here?
because you're friends.

## diane sawyer?
look, i, i, i don't know.

## what about yours?
look, it's our friends from channels two and five.

## can you tap into that phone call?
should be no problem.

## look, tracing, that's not a violation, right?
as long as we don't listen in.

## we get that?
i want somebody to find out what's going on.

## right?
think about it.

## listen, this could be a media frenzy, all right?
you'd get barbara walters...... i mean, larry king if you still wanted him.

## all right?
in a city where nobody looks out for anybody, you took a stand.

## so you want me to trust you to get me out of this?
yes, i do.

## or do you want to leave this to a professional?
until a professional gets here, i'll handle it.

## this is what i want to do, okay?
this is the city hotel here.

## not going to answer it?
i can't.

## i'm not gonna make her feel any better, am i?
well, you could ask her to forgive you, stuart.

## how can you be so sure?
it's you.

## yeah?
this lady says the perp's her husband.

## who do you think he's talking to?
i don't know.

## did this upset him, that you were talking to other men?
yes, he did seem a little upset, but it's, no...

## who's his psychiatrist?
he doesn't have one.

## captain?
if you can think of any dispute he's having currently, please, tell me.

## what about that wire tap?
we're working on it.

## you gotta hold tight a while, all right?
yeah, no problem.

## does he like being called stuart or stu?
stu.

## can you just talk to me?
yes, here's a photograph of us together.

## you just stay here.
you out of your fucking mind?

## just stay here, okay?
okay.

## you got a number of that lawyer?
no, we don't have a lawyer.

## okay?
i'm gonna get your husband out alive.

## you okay?
yeah, i'm fine.

## what?
but beautiful women always know.

## you talking about kelly?
that false indifference, superior air...... it's just a tease.

## why does she put on her makeup, do her hair, dress so nicely?
not for her husband that she hardly ever sees.

## what are you doing?
stay away from her.

## don't i dare?
i'm not the one who has hurt her, stuart.

## leave her out of this.
right?

## would you really miss kelly if she was gone?
that's it.

## when are you gonna learn that?
this is funny.

## still gonna give me the silent treatment?
hello.

## yes?
i'm listening.

## okay?
that's all i did.

## interlock your fingers behind your head.
esu, esu?

## answer it.
okay?

## i want her in the car.
what the fuck are you doing?

## so can we start over?
you lied.

## okay?
i want you to do it quickly, and i want you to do it quietly.

## where's the esu sergeant?
you said we could go.

## besides the fear of death?
i dive out and you've got one shot.

## you think you can get me?
i could go for some target practice.

## what's up next to the florescent bulb?
check it out, stu.

## you'd shoot me if you got the chance, wouldn't you?
with a big fucking smile on my face.

## see the pink curtains?
because it's fun.

## isn't that what you wanted?
you know where i am, and you have a gun.

## who?
the motel.

## let's just see what he does, all right?
let's see what he's doing.

## how do you figure?
you get to choose between them.

## should i choose?
one of them can take your place.

## don't you get the game yet?
you're a selfish guy.

## blond or brunette?
time's running out.

## i can't take this anymore.
you or them?

## you're looking at a suicide on national fucking tv.
what are you doing?

## you gonna let me take this over?
tell everybody to hold on, to hold their fire.

## what're you doing?
you liked how she sounded on the phone at the store.

## okay, how does this end?
tell me how this ends.

## what about that phone call to your store?
i got a phone call this afternoon.

## how long will it take to get a record of her calls?
if he's using that secure line, we won't know more than now.

## it would be safer if you got back in the car, okay?
please get back in the car.

## want me to clear the streets?
yeah.

## let's not let him know we know too much, okay?
i don't know.

## you wanna wake up, stu?
i wanna, but i got issues i can't talk about.

## that your psychiatrist on the phone?
yeah, yeah.

## it was liberating, right?
should've been.

## what the fuck do you want?
it's my world.

## all right?
never.

## you got some bad news on that call?
the worst.

## okay?
that's it.

## so this is all some religious thing?
that explains it.

## kill myself?
yes.

## all this shit just to watch me die?
no.

## everything?
no.

## anything?
no, not yet.

## okay?
stuart, i'm offering you a chance to redeem yourself.

## what, you couldn't find anyone worse than me?
not a murderer or a child molester but a publicist...... who has fantasies about pretty little actresses.

## these are my crimes?
stuart, i know your crimes.

## somebody got a 20 on this pam?
don't blame her.

## then why the confession?
i didn't do it for you.

## you got a room?
604.

## i can't stop lying?
they're coming up the stairs.

## there's nobody there?
they're coming through that fucking door to put you out of your misery.

## if this is true, i have to take someone with me, don't i?
since kelly is the most important thing in your life, i'll take her.

## what's his condition?
critical.

## your wife's fine, all right?
all right, try not to sit up.

## what hit me?
rubber bullet.

## did you get him?
you did.

## are you okay?
it's okay.

## sure you can hold on?
i gotta see him.

## you recognize him?
yeah.

## isn't it funny?
you hear a phone ring, and it could be anybody.

## we don't do magicians.
but a ringing phone has to be answered, doesn't it?

## magicians?
donny g is an artist who happens to look like a supermodel.

## and i haven't told my client, my favorite client...... that i am making this call, all right?
he wants new guys.

## what's up with my party, stu?

## so you want me to trust you to get me out of this?
yes, i do.

## or do you want to leave this to a professional?
until a professional gets here, i'll handle it.

## this is what i want to do, okay?
this is the city hotel here.

## not going to answer it?
i can't.

## i'm not gonna make her feel any better, am l?
well, you could ask her to forgive you, stuart.

## how can you be so sure?
it's you.

## yeah?
this lady says the perp's her husband.

## who do you think he's talking to?
i don't know.

## did this upset him, that you were talking to other men?
yes, he did seem a little upset, but it's, no it's not like that.

## who's his psychiatrist?
he doesn't have one.

## captain?
lf you can think of any dispute he's having currently, please, tell me.

## what about that wire tap?
we're working on it.

## you gotta hold tight a while, all right?
yeah, no problem.

## does he like being called stuart or stu?
stu.

## can you just talk to me?

no, we don't have a lawyer.

## okay?
i'm gonna get your husband out alive.

## you okay?
yeah, i'm fine.

## what?
but beautiful women always know.

## you talking about kelly?
that false indifference, superior air...... it's just a tease.

## why does she put on her makeup, do her hair, dress so nicely?
not for her husband that she hardly ever sees.

## what are you doing?
stay away from her.

## don't i dare?
i'm not the one who has hurt her, stuart.

## leave her out of this.
right?

## would you really miss kelly if she was gone?
that's it.

## when are you gonna learn that?
this is funny.

## still gonna give me the silent treatment?
hello.

## yes?
i'm listening.

## okay?
that's all i did.

## i want you to turn around. lnterlock your fingers behind your head.
esu, esu?

## answer it.
okay?

## i want her in the car.
what the fuck are you doing?

## so can we start over?
you lied.

## okay?
i want you to do it quickly, and i want you to do it quietly.

## where's the esu sergeant?
you said we could go.

## besides the fear of death?
i dive out and you've got one shot.

## you think you can get me?
i could go for some target practice.

## what's up next to the florescent bulb?
check it out, stu.

## you'd shoot me if you got the chance, wouldn't you?
with a big fucking smile on my face.

## see the pink curtains?
because it's fun.

## isn't that what you wanted?
you know where i am, and you have a gun.

## who?
the motel.

## let's just see what he does, all right?
let's see what he's doing.

## how do you figure?
you get to choose between them.

## should i choose?
one of them can take your place.

## don't you get the game yet?
you're a selfish guy.

## blond or brunette?
time's running out.

## i can't take this anymore.
you or them?

## you're looking at a suicide on national fucking tv.
what are you doing?

## you gonna let me take this over?
tell everybody to hold on, to hold their fire.

## what're you doing?
you liked how she sounded on the phone at the store.

## okay, how does this end?
tell me how this ends.

## what about that phone call to your store?
i got a phone call this afternoon.

## how long will it take to get a record of her calls?
lf he's using that secure line, we won't know more than now.

## it would be safer if you got back in the car, okay?
please get back in the car.

## want me to clear the streets?
yeah.

## let's not let him know we know too much, okay?
i don't know.

## you wanna wake up, stu?
i wanna, but i got issues i can't talk about.

## that your psychiatrist on the phone?
yeah, yeah.

## it was liberating, right?
should've been.

## you trust me, stu?
get this man a seat on oprah.

## what the fuck do you want?
it's my world.

## all right?
never.

## you got some bad news on that call?
the worst.

## okay?
that's it.

## so this is all some religious thing?
that explains it.

## kill myself?
yes.

## all this shit just to watch me die?
no.

## everything?
no.

## anything?
no, not yet.

## okay?
stuart, i'm offering you a chance to redeem yourself.

## what, you couldn't find anyone worse than me?
not a murderer or a child molester but a publicist...... who has fantasies about pretty little actresses.

## these are my crimes?
stuart, i know your crimes.

## somebody got a 20 on this pam?
don't blame her.

## then why the confession?
i didn't do it for you.

## you got a room?
604.

## i can't stop lying?
they're coming up the stairs.

## there's nobody there?
they're coming through that fucking door to put you out of your misery.

## if this is true, i have to take someone with me, don't i?
since kelly is the most important thing in your life, i'll take her.

## what's his condition?
critical.

## your wife's fine, all right?
all right, try not to sit up.

## what hit me?
rubber bullet.

## did you get him?
you did.

## are you okay?
it's okay.

## sure you can hold on?
i gotta see him.

## you recognize him?
yeah.

## isn't it funny?
you hear a phone ring, and it could be anybody.

## that's nice.
but a ringing phone has to be answered, doesn't it?

## that means o. k., doesn't it?
gina, come to hollywood with me.

## i like your for such stupidity.
and, then?

## really?
life is more complicated here than in your country.

## kid, go to hollywood by yourself, ok?
kid...

## you speculate a lot.
to gina of the hotel adriano?

## you fell in love with her too, didn't you?
we are going down refuel.

## where's porco?
he is talking with my dad.

## you got a cigarette?
curtis is will go back to america sooner or later.

## is it byron's?
no, it's mine.

## that girl?
she made my plane much better then before.

## is that true?
miss, there is a complicated reason behind this...

## you are going to break, aren't you?
but, what i want to say is...

## would you back off?
my shoes.

## aren't you ashamed of being helped by curtis, the american?
if your mother heard of that, she would cry, and don't even take a shower.

## boss, what are we supposed to do?
she convinced us.

## do we ask him to fight the plg, again?
hey, hold this.

## will you marry me if i win?
i'm serious.

## are you going to fight or not?
i'm willing to fight for love.

## we are partners, aren't we?
we are going to have a hard time.

## trust me, eh?
i haven't heard that in a long time, but i'm glad you said that.

## fio?
i'm fine.

## hey?
i should have padded the deal.

## you can't sleep, can you?
now, i just saw...

## why did you become a pig?
huh, you are a nice girl.

## my story?
well...

## white?
yeah, it was like a flash.

## god said it wasn't your time yet, didn't he?
fools.

## are they all air pirates?
if you do, clap your hands.

## may i take a picture with you?
his skill made the pig an ace of the adriatic sea.

## porco...
is his machine gun broken!?

## she's in her room, and doesn't come out.
are you teasing me or what?

## does she want to go or not?
i want to see that fight...

## can't you fly faster, much faster?
it's impossible.

## did you see my punch?
don't choose both.

## take a shower sometimes, will you?
thank you, too, mr. curtis.

## do you want to help me?
porco rosso, get going.

## mamma aiuto?
i don't need a cheap job.

## is that all?
ah...

## are you bad guys?
yup.

## are we hostages?
yeah.

## you guys are called air pirates, aren't you?
you know a lot.

## i'm busy.
neat, isn't it?

## do you want all 15 of them?
that's why i asked if we wanted to take all of them.

## it's over there, right?
he must be hiding.

## quiet down.
a half of the coins!?

## quiet down, will you!?
don't touch that, you'll break it.

## pee?
if he is, that's a shame for the pilots of the adriatic.

## is that plane up front yours?
yeah, it's a plane of the rattle snake, bringing me fame and fortune.

## you're up to no good, aren't you?
i'm glad you came, but don't play war games.

## hey, what are you doing!?
porco, tell me the whole story.

## you got the news?
i got it today.

## how can we break your curse?
that american is very talented.

## how about buying some patriot bonds in devotion to our country?
welcome, mr. porco rosso.

## the country's busy, isn't it?
oh, yeah.

## is it ok, like usual?
we have a new supply of an incendiary bomb.

## could you tell me the difference between a soldier and a bounty hunter?
one's scum if he can't win in war.

## who ever heard of an air pirate who was deep in debt?
we had nothing to barter with, captain.

## why do i have to stay with such pathetic looking group?
it's due to the pig, the crimson pig.

## hey, is the american around?
you, stingy...

## are you hurt?
i was about to leave to pick you up.

## do you think i'm a bulletin board or something?
however much i'm worried about you guys...

## why don't you just build another one?
i want to keep this one.

## who's the cute girl?
my granddaughter, from america.

## i need 15 knots more.
is she really your granddaughter?

## curtis?
i've hear of him.

## what do you think?
this is a hallvolley, isn't it.

## are you going to take all of my money?
these days, wads of bills aren't worth a damn.

## are they all right?
all three left to look for work.

## then... who is going to design my plane?
she is young, but she's got something my sons lack.

## or, do you think i'm too young to do it?
both, miss.

## experience?
no, inspiration, i think.

## but let me do the job, will you?
if i don't do it well, don't pay me.

## ok, grandpa?
she's my granddaughter, she'll do well.

## could you sleep here tonight?
i'll make your bed tomorrow.

## did you stay up all night?
this is the rough plan.

## what do you think?
i want to redesign this wing section, leaving the plane shape as it is.

## there's a 5 degree angle to the wings here, right?
everything should be fine then.

## you'll let me continue with this, then?
thank you.

## is she going to build this plane by herself?
yes, i'd like to have some money for my great grandchildren.

## there are no men here, right?
yup.

## these are all relatives of yours?
yes, they don't have any jobs these days.

## you don't think curtis is worth it?
sure, this is a good idea.

## so, you're a major?
you've moved up in the world, fierrali.

## why did you come back?
i make it a rule to go wherever i want to.

## were you followed?
i gave them the slip.

## you are a pig after all, huh?
thanks for your advice, fierrali.

## porco, need a ride?
hey, you're a life saver.

## why?
because i gave them the slip.

## a spy?
i'm going, too.

## do you understand what you are saying?
shh...

## see?
this really fits.

## would you hold that?
look, miss.

## and, if you're going to fight curtis... you'll need a good mechanic, won't you?
look, i'm a man, you know.

## are you really her grandfather?
you don't have to pay her.

## you really want her to be wanted by the police?
no.

## what?
kind of like a tomboy, just like you.

## is he following us?
no.

## do you know him?
the air force lies in wait up ahead.

## that means o. k., then?
gina, come to hollywood with me.

## i like you for such foolishness.
and, then?

## really!?
life is more complicated here than in your country.

## kid...?
i hit my head because you did an acrobatic maneuver all of a sudden.

## that was her in the white dress on the hotel terrace, wasn't it?
my grandpa told me that every pilot in the adriatic sea falls in love with gina.

## you fell in love with her too, didn't you, porco?
he is talking with my dad.

## what?
you should offer yourself to one side or the other.

## you got a cigarette?
curtis will go back to america sooner or later.

## is that byron?
no, it's me.

## really?
she made my plane much better then before.

## you mean it, porco?
miss, there's a complicated reason behind this.

## would you step back?
you guys don't understand a word i said.

## aren't you ashamed that you need the help of that american, curtis?
if your mother heard of that, she would cry.

## boss, what are we supposed to do?
she convinced us.

## do we ask him to fight the pig, again?
the contract is already over.

## will you marry me if i win?
i'm serious.

## are you going to fight or not?
i'm willing to fight for love.

## we are partners, aren't we?
we are going to have a hard time.

## trust me, eh?
i haven't heard that in a long time, but i'm glad you said that.

## you feel sick?
i should have padded the deal.

## having trouble sleeping?
just now...

## why did you become a pig?
you're a nice kid.

## my story?
well...

## white sky?
yeah.

## i was flying alone over the sea, almost touching it.
belneldi, you're alive?

## god said it wasn't your time yet, didn't he?
in my mind, i thought he might let me fly like that forever.

## are they all air pirates?
the scum of the mediterranean... gangs,... pirates, smugglers,... spies,... and even a few ordinary people.

## my mom told me you're going to like me soon.
do you understand?

## give me that.
may i take a picture with you?

## looping?
i got it.

## what?
the pig doesn't kill anybody.

## she's in her room, and won't come out.
are you teasing me or what?

## does she want to go or not?
i want to see that fight myself...

## f?
must be from fierrali.

## jammed?
you're finished.

## can't you fly any faster?
it's impossible.

## did you see my punch?
i'm gonna take him down next round.

## what?
you can't have both.

## marco.
gina?

## thank you.
marco, can you hear me?

## take a shower sometime, will you?
thank you, too, mr. curtis.

## do you want to help me?
i'm going to lead them off.

## cq, this is w 9 gfo here.

cq, this is w 9 gfo.

## is anybody out there?
not getting anything.

## come back?
copy, w 9 gfo.

## what do i say?
just be yourself.

## come back?
pensacola.

## pensacola, where's pensacola?
i'll give you a hint.

## how's the weather down there in florida?
pensacola, florida.

## can we hear all the way to new york?
sure.

## can we hear all the way to california?
i don't see why not.

## can we hear all the way to alaska?
on a really clear day.

## can we hear all the way to china?
on a really, really clear day.

## could we talk to the moon?
if it's a big enough radio, i don't see why not.

## or what's the one after that?
i don't think even the biggest radio could reach that far.

## do you think there's people on other planets?
i don't know, sparks.

## come back?
i'm going to need a bigger antenna.

## isn't she a beauty?
it'll do.

## when can i get dish time?
right there, that's it.

## that much?
about what i'd expect after what he had to say about you.

## anything else?
those were the highlights.

## cracker jack?
no, thanks.

## mind if i sit down?
convinced it has some dark military purpose.

## what are you studying up there?
the usual.

## what are you writing?
the usual.

## are you a student or something?
i'm a writer.

## i take it you know him?
you could say that.

## have dinner with me tonight?
i don't make a good research subject.

## dr. drumlin, how are you?
glad you could make it.

## how is that new office?
still settling in.

## not unlike my l band, globular clusters work.
still waiting for e. t. to call?

## even profitable?
nothing, as long as your motive...... is the search for truth.

## you're a priest?
not really.

## you see that large w shaped constellation there?
that's cassiopeia.

## when did you know you wanted to be an astronomer?
he said that it wasn't a star.

## and there's no chance that...... you had this experience because some part of you needed to have it?
i'm a reasonably intelligent guy, but this....

## and?
and pretty soon they asked my dad...... if he wouldn't mind keeping me home from now on.

## is it this guy?
yeah.

## you're close to him, aren't you?
i was.

## what do you say...... we pack a picnic tomorrow and hike up to mount arecibo?
i don't think i can.

## how about dinner tomorrow night?
i know a great dive.

## ellie, did i miss something?
no.

## how can i reach you?
just leave your number.

## do you copy?
dad, this is ellie.

## are you there?
come back.

## are you there?
dad, this is ellie.

## what are you doing up so early?
i was thinking...... we'd make a pretty good team.

## what are you talking about?
drumlin pulled the plug.

## it's true, you pulled the plug?
you can't see it now, but i'm doing you a favor.

## did that investor from houston ever get back to us?
i'll hit him up on my way to l. a.

## what do you mean?
two guys wanted to build a thing called an airplane.

## science fiction, right?
all i'm asking is for you to just have the tiniest bit of vision.

## how was the trip?
there's been enormous pressure from other scientists as well.

## what?
staring at tv static for hours, listening to washing machines.

## just this once?
we lost.

## who would make the best astronomers?
think about it.

## who has the perfect synthesis of career and lifestyle?
no, not at all.

## is the world fundamentally a better place...... because of science and technology?
we're becoming a synthesized society...... in a hurry to get to the....

## what is the meaning?
we have mindless jobs, take frantic vacations.

## there's a bad drive on 16.
any wonder we've lost our sense of direction?

## what shall i do about the source queue?
forget it and hold the queue.

## run every frequency you can think of.
do you copy?

## how you doing?
talk to me, guys.

## what's the frequency?
4. 46...... 23 gigahertz.

## we recording?
never stopped.

## on this frequency?
no.

## whatever it is, it ain't local.
how's spying tonight?

## position?
i checked interferometry.

## it's only 26 light years away.
vega?

## maybe they're not from there, they're visiting.
peak intensity?

## spacecraft?
this system's full of debris.

## do you have a source location yet?
we put it right smack in the middle.

## who do we call now?
everybody.

## where's the girl?
22 stations worldwide...... now confirm the signal.

## why not just speak english?
maybe because 70 of the planet speaks other languages.

## why?
it's hardly yesterday.

## excuse me, who are you?
michael kitz, national security advisor.

## who are all these people?
i have no idea.

## you think a civilization sending this message intends it just for americans?
you might have consulted us.

## you want to classify prime numbers?
due to earth's rotation, we're in line with vega only hours a day.

## hear what?
harmonic.

## patch it into the image processor.
what is it?

## want the new data?
yeah, the new one we just recorded.

## what do you make of that?
it's two different interlaced frames.

## can you clean it up?
i'm working on it.

## what the hell...?
you're not going to believe this.

## does anybody speak german?
i declare the games in berlin...... at the celebration...... of the first olympics of the new era...... as opened.

## 20 million people died defeating the bastard...... and he's our first ambassador to outer space?
hitler's politics have nothing to do with this.

## fish, what is the story over here?
i thought ellie was supposed to be on.

## those interlaced frames we thought were noise?
this has structure.

## is there a renewed assessment of security threat?
i'll answer your questions after a few corrections.

## no two are alike and we've uncovered over 10, 000 already.
are you ready?

## what does it mean, doctor?
we have no idea.

## how long will it take to decode it?
i'm going to recommend that dr. drumlin coordinate the decryption effort.

## understood?
yes.

## are these the kind of people...... that you want talking to your god for you?
i'll be there.

## i presume?
mr. hadden.

## you live here?
i find it convenient to keep my interests...... mobile.

## what am i doing here?
you'll see.

## that does what, doctor?
we don't know.

## transport?
there's no proof of that.

## why risk the personnel?
it could be a weapon.

## why is it the egghead position that aliens are always benign?
we pose no threat to them.

## how guilty would we feel if we destroyed a few microbes on an anthill?
i hope you're right.

## are you?
mr. joss, the president's waiting.

## see you at the reception?
yeah, i wouldn't miss it.

## miss constantine, may i speak to you?
certainly.

## here we go.
do you know where i can find a really great dress?

## it's like you're saying that...... science killed god.
you want me to quote you?

## what if science simply revealed...... that he never existed in the first place?
i think we need to get some air.

## ever heard of it?
hoccam's razor.

## so what's more likely?
thank you.

## an all powerful god created the universe...... then decided not to give any proof of his existence?
or...... that he doesn't exist at all and that we created him...... so we wouldn't feel so small and alone.

## how do you know you're not deluding yourself?
i mean, for me...... i'd need proof.

## your dad, did you love him?
yes.

## what happened?
you were right all along.

## who goes?
different nations are being compensated in different ways.

## on what basis do you choose...... a human being to represent humanity?
good question, larry.

## how do you respond?
this message is from a civilization that may be anywhere...... from hundreds to millions and millions of years ahead of us.

## faith?
i was going to say, a sense of adventure.

## but what can i say to this?
meet me at noon.

## can we talk about einstein?
yeah, sure.

## why?
it's a historic opportunity.

## why?
from as long as i can remember, i've been searching for...... something...... some reason why we're here.

## who are we?
if this is a chance to find out even a part of that answer....

## don't you?
you're an incredibly brave woman, ellie.

## how did you survive technological adolescence...... without destroying yourself?
that more than any other question is one i personally would like answered.

## would you consider yourself...... a spiritual person?
as a scientist...... i rely on empirical evidence, and in this matter...... i don't believe that there's data either way.

## why'd you do it?
our job was to select someone to speak for everybody.

## mechanical?
go.

## safety?
crew ops, verify all pre test procedures are complete.

## pad leader, is everything okay with you?
roger.

## gerry, how are we looking?
looks good.

## mechanical, you still happy?
roger.

## david, how's it looking to you?
okay.

## the question everyone here is asking is...... what happens then?
others believe it might open up a doorway to some other dimension.

## who's right?
that's what today's test is all about.

## subsystems ready?
40 normal acceleration.

## gerry, can you confirm?
everything looks good.

## crew ops?
nothing wrong.

## i think we're okay, but we'll let him finish.
what's he talking about?

## mechanical, you still okay?
he shouldn't be there.

## can you hear me?
yes, i hear.

## see him?
in a related story...

## can i help you?
what we do...... we do for the goodness of all mankind.

## how kind of you to call.
mr. hadden?

## mr. hadden, where are you?
the russian government was kind enough to give me accommodations on mir.

## you're living on a space station?
it's quite simple, really.

## why build one when you can have two at twice the price?
only, this one can be kept secret.

## want to take a ride?
augmenting our restraint and......communications console subsystem...... is your personal recording unit.

## i'm going to travel 26 light years to commit suicide?
something may go wrong.

## with a piece of engineering this complex...... with so many unknowns, could the unthinkable occur?
the security in hokkaido has been incredibly tight.

## do you copy?
reading you five by five.

## are you reading me?
that's affirmative.

## communications?
go.

## life support?
go.

## is that you?
that's a big affirmative.

## who let you in there?
a higher power intervened.

## mechanical?
we're good.

## dynamics, can you confirm vibration?
it looks good here.

## mechanical, confirm?
it looks fine to me.

## jerry, what do you think?
i'm still go.

## let me show you.

## see that?
negative.

## can we boost signal?
it's at maximum.

## do you read this?

i'm sorry i couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.

## why did you contact us?
you contacted us.

## there are others?
many others.

## they all...... travel here through that transit system you built?
we didn't build it.

## all the civilizations you find come here?
not all.

## is this some test?
no, no test.

## now?
you go home.

## home?
but...... i have so many questions.

## do we get to come back?
ellie, this is control.

## what's going on?
i don't know.

## what?
it's all right.

## what day is this?
i'm sorry.

## how long was i gone?
the ipv dropped straight through the machine.

## but the headset didn't record a single image?
just this.

## how do you explain this, doctor?
i can't.

## isn't that correct, doctor?
a fraction of a second earth time, yes.

## earth time?
senator, i believe that the machine opened up a wormhole...... a tunnel through space time, also known as an einstein rossen bridge.

## there is no evidence they actually exist?
there is no direct evidence, no.

## bring you thousands of light years, then send you home without proof?
they said it's how it's been done for billions of years.

## you think i was delusional?
i do think you may have suffered some kind of an episode.

## would be impossible.
to fake a signal from vega...... what would you need?

## hadden?
s. r. hadden.

## that he engineered this?
s. r. hadden...... a legendary power broker in perhaps his final bid for immortality.

## doctor, are you familiar with the scientific precept...... known as occam's razor?
yes.

## a man with the means and motive to play you and all of us...... as pawns in the most elaborate, most expensive hoax of all time?
you come to us with no evidence, no records...... no artifacts... only a story that, to put it mildly, strains credibility.

## are you going to sit there and tell us we should just take this all...... on faith?
please answer the question, doctor.

## is it possible that it didn't happen?
yes.

## you admit you have no physical evidence to back up your story?
yes.

## then why don't you simply withdraw your testimony and concede...... that this journey to the center of the galaxy never took place?
because i can't.

## we give her a medal?
i'd say at least a healthy grant.

## you read the confidential report from the investigating committee?
i flipped through it.

## that is interesting, isn't it?
and you can see over there, we're building 45 brand new dishes.

## are there other people out there in the universe?
that's a good question.

## what do you think?
i don't know.

## skeptic, huh?
the important thing is that you all keep searching for your own answers.

## right?
archdruid gutuart... might makes law.

## tell us what we must do?
every people, every tribe needs its legend.

## do you know the meaning of my name?
epona, the she horse.

## do you know the meaning of my name?
no.

## are you a guest at the feast of may?
yes.

## and you my boy, who are you?
i'm no boy.

## who are you?
nobody.

## what are you doing, my son?
showing epona the city, mother.

## your queen?
i like the sound of that.

## for the moment?
it's a secret.

## have you forgotten that the arvernes have proclaimed a republic?
but let us put aside these petty rivalries.

## do you forget that it was you who hired the teuton mercenaries... to conquer other lands?
the romans are no menace.

## what are you saying?
it's time for me to do what i must.

## and when i'll learn to do that will i'll have a drop of your blood?
when you achieve that, you'll dispose of my life.

## did you see your death, vercingetorix?
no.

## what does it mean?
the knowledge that comes to you in dreams is yours alone.

## i'm sorry.
what?

## what druid?
the man in the white robe.

## you know me, arverne?
you'd be a hard man to forget, for the son of celtill.

## where are you going?
gergovia.

## would you like to join me?
for a while.

## what keeps you here so far from rome?
the same thing that kept you hidden in the woods... and now sets you on my road.

## are you a druid?
no, i chose another path.

## i wonder where he comes from.
do you think he could win back gergovia by himself?

## what do you think you're doing?
setting my house in order...

## can you believe it?
you are welcome among us.

## why haven't your spies found the archdruid?
i'm sure he's the one who teaches them... to believe in perpetual changes.

## why not?
i get seasick.

## for the thousands of slaves?
you still owe us what you borrowed to pay for the festivals.

## to conquer britain?
i'm sending the gauls.

## king?
vercingetorix, no.

## so dumnorix, still afraid of the sea?
i guarantee that the sea will be calm.

## he offers us half the booty, and that's not enough for you?
it's too much.

## and what have you become, now?
a civilised and educated woman.

## lmpressed by a roman general who is even more impressed with himself?
i am, after all, an impressive man.

## to drive your legions from gaul?
too many tribes.

## why not a king chosen by destiny?
i knew you would come.

## you're jealous?
i think often of the young boy of gergovia... to whom i gave a token of my fidelity.

## why do you think he brought us together?
it's always wise to assume caesar knows everything he should know.

## what is that supposed to mean epona?
you are and will always be... the leader of great warriors.

## ls the silver tongued vercingetorix trying to convince me... or does the leader of great warriors want to bring me back by force?
we might as well talk, we can always fight to death later.

## what order of caesar did you come to execute, riding his own horse?
to bring you back to be tried according to our laws.

## what are you saying?
even if he were furious, and he must be...

## what gaul would embark for britain if he executed his children?
he will not do it.

## what do we do now?
i thought to offer you my horse... and then together, let's go to avenge the death of your father.

## let's go.
have you never asked yourself... who would set eduens against eduens, and arverne against arverne?

## what does this hand mean?
that we have made an enemy... and it would have been much better to have him as a friend.

## evacuate the city... or i will burn it to ashes with your people still inside.
ls gutuart still alive?

## what right do you have, arvern?
i can't let the romans take avaricum with all its supplies.

## or will i live to regret it?
you did what you thought was right... instead of what you knew was necessary.

## was that a mistake?
might does not make right... nor does wrong.

## do you think so?
now we will do what vercingetorix hasn't done.

## you accuse me of treason?
then kill me.

## useless?
there's no one there.

## what do you see after the victory?
i see all the peoples of gaul united.

## under the dark desire of revenge?
no.

## why?
the cadurques shall follow... the orders of the eduens.

## and do you still trust the leader of the great warriors... who wanted you to be his queen?
at the time i accepted when i was asked by the boy.

## and now?
i'd be honoured to be asked by the king of the arvernes.

## but what?
well, i might be gone for an eternity.

## what?
help him.

## to us.
you want to be my squire?

## do you know who the goddess of alesia is?
no.

## no, who?
it's the horse goddess epona.

## leave here?
i thought you wanted one great final battle, just like caesar.

## ls it what gaul really needs?
no... but now the die is already cast.

## what?
i'm saving the rat for those traitors.

## or you doubt their faithfulness because they haven't arrived yet?
i'm sorry, you're right.

## what are you afraid of?
the deep silence of others.

## what is it going to change?
spring will still come, grass will still grow by itself... and now caesar is besieged in his own fortifications.

## what if they don't attack?
then we die.

## and what will decide?
destiny, brutus.

## won't you play with us?
one toss, catch with one hand.

## you want to live forever?
then i will lead you, and together... we will become immortal.

## and now what are we to do?
well, it's up to him.

## where will it lead you?
i've always known that i would always love you.

## nervous?
no.

## okay?
okay.

## are you okay?
yeah, great.

## just what the hell is it, man?
you don't fuck with me, i don't fuck with you.

## when did oliver die?
this morning.

## suppose the clones have no soul or they're dangerous?
clone pets are every bit as safe as real pets.

## lf it's so safe...... then why is it against the law to clone humans?
because the human brain is too complicated to syncord.

## you remember the experiment they did?
that's why it didn't work.

## you can?
we can even color coordinate him to match your decorating scheme.

## what happened to you?
i waited at kelly's for half an hour.

## i'm sim pal cindy, what's yourname?

## why does anyone want to kill me?
he got home first.

## you got me?
dr. weir is interested in medicine, not politics.

## do you think human cloning laws should be changed?
suppose a 1 0 year old boy is in the hospital, dying of liver cancer.

## so, what does that mean?
enjoy the party.

## how's my star quarterback?
i'd say i felt like a million bucks, but i'd hate to take a pay cut.

## don't remind me, all right?
that was one nasty hit you took last week.

## are you all right?
i'm just feeling like i don't quite belong.

## should i call dr. stevens?
no, no, no.

## mr. speaker?
thank you so much for coming.

## champagne?
that was quite a speech.

## you heard that?
sorry i got carried away.

## mr. speaker...... could i offer you a glass of brandy in my office upstairs?
i was 0 when billy was born.

## lf there were something we could do for billy..., only it was highly illegal,... would you consider it?
of course i would.

## but he'd be cured?
he'd be exactly the same.

## or if the laws were changed one day?
billy wouldn't have anything to worry about.

## was your car stolen or not?
yes.

## so you did report it?
no, i took it.

## you stole your own car?
i'm a court appointed virtual attorney.

tell you what.

## why don't you just stay out here?
he's fine.

## darling, where are you?
hi, sugar.

## have you been working out?
you look so good.

## or should i just take this off now?
hello, adam.

## would you like a beer?
i'm sorry i missed the party, but...... all of a sudden it's 1 1:00 and i wound up at kelly's.

## you missed my party?
not on purpose.

## you feel terrible?
i don't understand.

## what the hell is going on?
lf you weren't at my party, then you didn't see him.

## what are you going to do?
take my life back.

## why not?
he's not real.

## how do i know he's not you and you're not him?

we should smoke cigars more often.

## who are you?
of course.

## they find the bastard that stole it?
go see.

## want to get a cup of tea, then go upstairs?
yeah.

## what was that?
nothing.

## the....

## you want a beer?
you saw the clone do something with natalie.

## what would you have done?
i would have....

## he smoked my stogie too?
the bastard.

## she couldn't tell it wasn't me?
it didn't look like it.

## why did you do that?
don't do anything stupid, now.

## hey, adam.
ls that you, hank?

## ls hank sleeping on the floor again?
that's so cute.

## why did you kill my friend?
hank morgan was an abomination to god.

## you're coming to my recital, right?
of course.

## what about her dna scan?
came up with cystic fibrosis.

## cystic fibrosis?
which is impossible, considering it's a childhood disease...... and she would have been dead 30 years ago.

## but...... you might want to use these.
what am i to do without you?

## what's in here?
lower intestines for dr. weir.

## my time has already passed.

## where's dr. weir?
his lab's over there.

## you had to have my what do you call it?
your syncording.

## how did you get this?
i haven't been here.

## you don't become a rich man without making enemies...... so we back up his mind religiously.

## ... and we cloned him yesterday.
you own the roadrunners, right?

## so?
lf that came out, he'd be destroyed in every way.

## you can't find one guy?
there.

## okay, clara.
what's up?

## why do you think i'm telling you?
because i can do nothing to stop them.

## my family?

i nearly shot you.

## what are you doing?
yours.

## griffin, what's the matter?
my wife, katherine, is dead.

## why?
you're right, griffin.

## shorter life spans gives us leverage.
what should i understand?

## what's the point?

## what are you going to do for me?
i'm going to give you...... the greatest gift you can imagine.

## a gift?
i'm gonna save your life.

## what are you talking about?
i'm gonna kill you now...... and i'm going to clone you using your latest syncording.

## do you see what i'm doing for you?

## you'll find we have more in common where's my family?

## your shaving cut?
easily reproduced.

## how many times have you been cloned?
i've lost count.

## see?

## kind of takes the fun out of being alive, doesn't it?
so, you see...... your family isn't really your family.

## you have a better idea?
yeah.

## what about god?
you're one of those.

## so i can understand your unique perspective?
no.

## you got the location?

## jeez, mary... where you gonna find a gem like that?
ok, well, here's the catch...

## like a drug dealer?
no, i was thinking along the lines, maybe... of somebody like... an architect or something.

## but i want somebody with freedom in theirjob... you know?
somebody who can do it anywhere... and just leave at a drop of a hat.

## and where would you and your beer bellied architect... be going to?
mmm.

## super bowl?
that's good.

## what's that supposed to mean?
it means you change your mind too much.

## what was his name?
pack man.

## what really happened with brett?
yeah.

## you know what tucker said brett told him?
he said that if warren wasn't in my life... that he would have popped the question... a long time ago.

## cactus?
i'm only waiting 7 minutes... total.

## ted?
ahem.

## let's go.
iook, i still have to pee, all right?

## see, hon?
i told you he was gay.

## do you speak english?
yeah.

## have you heard that as couples age...... they lose their ability to hear each other?
no.

## what are you reading?
oh, yeah.

## how about you?
i was thinking about going to the lounge car.

## would you like to come with me?
yeah.

## how do you speak such good english?
i went to school for a summer in los angeles.

## it's fine here?
yeah, this is good.

## me?
i'm american.

## are you sure?

## and you don't speak any other language, right?
yeah, yeah.

## so where are you headed?
well, back to paris.

## where?
la sorbonne.

## you know?

## you're coming from budapest?
i was visiting my grandmother.

## how is she?
she's okay.

## she's all right?
she's fine.

## where are you going?
i'm going to vienna.

## what's there?
no idea.

## you're on holiday?
i don't really know what i'm on.

## you know?
i've just been traveling around, riding trains for two or three weeks.

## you were visiting friends or just on your own?
i had a friend in madrid, but...

## so has this trip around europe been good for you?
yeah, sure.

## what?
it's had its...

## what do you mean?
well, you know, for instance...... you have ideas that you ordinarily wouldn't have.

## want to hear one?
tell me.

## do you know what that is?
anybody can produce a show real cheap, and they have to put it on.

## all those mundane, boring things...... everybody has to do every day of their fucking life?
you say it your way.

## who's gonna watch?
think about it like this.

## why is it that a dog sleeping in the sun...... is so beautiful?
it is.

## but a guy taking money from a bank machine...... looks like a complete moron?
so it's like a national geographic program, but on people.

## what do you think?
yeah, i can see it.

## you know what?
not service oriented.

## but you know what?
if your parents never...... fully contradict you about anything and are nice and supportive...

## you know what i mean?
i hate it.

## and then finally, i let go of the nozzle, you know?
and then i dropped the hose...... and she disappeared.

## you get off here, no?
yeah, what a drag.

## what?
i want to keep talking to you.

## right?
yeah.

## what?
come on.

## what would we do?
i don't know.

## jump ahead 10, 20 years, okay?
and you're married.

## my name?
jesse.

## you mean, jesse james, no?
no.

## isn't it?
i mean, i feel a little awkward.

## right?
yeah, this is great.

## sprechen sie english?
ja.

## what?
no, it was a joke.

## how long are you going to be here?
just for tonight.

## what could you be expecting?
we're on honeymoon.

## you're actors?
not professional.

## you have a real cow on stage?
no, an actor in a cow costume.

## the big ferris wheel?
we should go.

## 2130?
it's at 9:30.

## what's the name of this play?
i'm wilmington's cow.

## you'll be there?
we'll try.

## are you ready?
it's q and a time.

## we ask each other questions?
and you have to answer honestly.

## my first sexual feelings?
oh, my god.

## jean marc fleury?
we were at this summer camp together, and he was a swimmer.

## did you?
of course not.

## really?
yeah.

## no?
yes, your turn.

## have you ever been in love?
yes.

## after i went into detail about my sexual feelings?
they're different questions.

## i mean, what if i asked you about love?
i would have lied, but at least i would have made up a great story.

## love is a complex issue, you know?
i mean, yes, i've told somebody that i love them, and i've meant it.

## was it a beautiful thing?
not really.

## you know?
yeah.

## do you know playboy magazine?
i've heard of it.

## you don't know crystal?
well, i knew crystal.

## is it my turn now?
tell me something that really pisses you off.

## what else?
i hate...

## the media?
yeah, the media.

## is that all?
well, there's a lot of things, but...

## what's a problem for you?
you, probably.

## what?
i had a thought the other day that kind of...... qualifies as a problem.

## what is it?
it was a thought i had on the train, so...

## do you believe in reincarnation?
yeah.

## a lot of people talk about past lives and things like that, you know?
and even if they don't believe in it in some specific way...... people have a notion of an eternal soul.

## are modern souls only a fraction of the original souls?
if they are, that represents a 5000 to 1 split of each soul...... in the last 50, 000 years, which is a blip in the earth's time.

## is that why we're so specialized?
wait a minute, i'm not sure...

## have you heard of this singer?
i think she's american.

## do you want to go see if that listening booth still works?
yeah, okay.

## yeah?
it's tiny.

## how old are these?
around the beginning of the century.

## why were all the bodies washing up?
i think some were from accidents on boats and things like that.

## that's a river, right?
yeah.

## what?
you know...

## but you know what?
it doesn't matter what generation you're born into.

## did your parents divorce?
yeah, finally.

## you know, i've been wondering lately...... do you know anyone who's in a happy relationship?
yeah, sure.

## how do you know?
i know.

## oh, mr. romantic up in the ferris wheel?
oh, kiss me.

## what were you saying about her?
check these guys out.

## can i tell you a secret?
yeah.

## what?
come here.

## what?
i made eye contact.

## you want your palm read?
no.

## are you sure?
i'm sure.

## how much is it?
for you, 50.

## okay?
okay.

## that is a stranger to you?
i guess so.

## what?
she knew i was on vacation and that we didn't know each other...... and that i was going to become this great woman.

## that's way condescending, you know?
i mean, she wasn't even doing me.

## would you like that?
you're so...

## transitory?
transitory.

## you think this is open?
i don't know.

## you're close with your grandmother?
yeah.

## do you know anything about the quakers, the quaker religion?
no, not much.

## what?
it's not the appropriate place to tell it.

## would you be in paris by now if you hadn't gotten off the train?
no, not yet.

## what would you be doing?
i'd probably be hanging around the airport...... crying in my coffee because you didn't come with me.

## oh, yeah?
oh, i see.

## so i'm just a dumb american...... momentarily decorating your blank canvas, huh?
i'm having a great time.

## really?
me too.

## if we were always around each other...... what would be the first thing about me that would drive you mad?
no.

## what about me bugs you?
she flew into a rage and broke up with me.

## what is it about me bugs you?
nothing at all.

## if it had to be something, what would it be?
if it had to be something, if i had to think about it...... i kind of didn't really like this reaction at the palm reader.

## what the hell is a rooster prick?
you were like a boy whining...... because all the attention wasn't focused on him.

## this woman robs you blind, okay?
you were like a boy walking by an ice cream store...... crying because his mom won't buy him a milk shake.

## what?
i understand a little, but he doesn't at all.

## may i ask you a question?
so i would like to make a deal with you.

## so?
pick a word.

## milk shake?
oh, good.

## so, were we having our first fight back there?
i think so.

## even if we were, why does everyone think conflict is so bad?
there's a lot of good things coming out of conflict.

## what do you mean?
i got a poem.

## will you read it to us?
great.

## what?
he probably didn't just write that.

## what do you mean?
nothing.

## you know what drives me crazy?
people talking about...... how great technology is, how it saves all this time.

## but what good is saved time if nobody uses it?
if it just turns into more busy work.

## what?
nothing.

## you wanna go in here?
yeah.

## wanna go?
hello.

## you gonna buy me a beer?
yeah.

## you got a boyfriend waiting on you back in paris or anything like that?
no, not right now.

## six months ago?
oh, i'm sorry.

## she was gonna kill her boyfriend?
yeah, she was.

## she had to call the police?
she was totally convinced i was really gonna do it.

## so what happened then?
i totally got over him.

## why is it you become obsessed with people you don't...... really like that much?
i don't know.

## are you with anyone?
it's funny how we managed to avoid this subject for so long.

## what?
you sound like you just were hurt.

## do i?
all right.

## your girlfriend?
my ex girlfriend...... who has been on this art history program for the last year.

## you know what's the worst thing about somebody breaking up with you?
believe me, i know.

## did it work?
didn't help your pinball.

## not lately?
that's good.

## are you talking about monkeys?
yes, i am.

## why?
i never heard this one.

## you know what?
on this island, i think there will be only, like, maybe 43 men left.

## oh, yeah?
there's something to that.

## so who just got pushed to the frontline on that one?
women say they hate it if you're all protective.

## you know what?
i don't think woman really wants to destroy man.

## you wanna stop talking about this?
i hate it.

## should i give her some money?
everything that's interesting costs a little money.

## so a birth dance, huh?
looked a little bit like a mating dance to me.

## you all don't need us?
men are lucky we don't bite off their heads after mating.

## certain insects do that, like spiders and stuff?
we let you live.

## what are you complaining about?
see, you're officially kidding.

## i always make fun of it and stuff...... but isn't everything we do in life...... a way to be loved a little more?
i don't know.

## i know, it's almost impossible to succeed...... but who cares really?
the answer must be in the attempt.

## where is the waitress?
in new york, she'd be out of a job.

## you wanna talk in english, for laughs?
yeah, okay.

## are you crazy?
probably.

## he's from there?
no, no.

## why'd you get off?
well, he convinced me.

## what?
yeah, we kissed.

## really?
i've known you a long time.

## you gonna see him again?
we haven't talked about that yet.

## what's up?
hey, frank.

## how you been?
i'm glad you're home.

## so how was madrid?
madrid sucked.

## i told you, no?
yeah, yeah.

## so are you okay now?
yeah.

## you know how they say we're all each other's demons and angels?
well, she was literally a botticelli angel...... telling me everything would be okay.

## how did you meet?
on the train.

## oh, yeah?
us men are so stupid.

## don't they?
i feel like this is some dream world we're in.

## but then the morning comes and we turn into pumpkins, right?
i know.

## but don't you think that's what...... makes our time and specific moments so important?
yeah, i know.

## what do you think?
actually, i don't know.

## you'd hate to fly, right?
i'm not so scared of flying.

## what?
no, let's just be rational adults about this.

## it's not so bad if tonight is our only night, right?
people exchange numbers, addresses.

## yeah, why?
it's stupid.

## it's the only way, no?
well, all right.

## what?
it's just...

## it's depressing, no?
now, the only thing we're gonna think of is...... when we'll have to say goodbye.

## now?
say goodbye.

## you think you can do that?
no problem.

## do you speak english?
a bit.

## a bit?
i'm having kind of an odd situation...... which is that...

## you see that girl over there?
well, this is our only night together...... and she...

## your hand?
for the greatest night in your life.

## what about our rational, adult decision?
oh, yeah.

## what?
to be kissed.

## we die in the morning, right?
i think we should.

## you don't want to see me again?
no, of course i do.

## why do we make everything so complicated?
i don't know.

## what's the first thing you'll do when you get back to paris?
call my parents.

## what about you?
i don't know.

## you have a dog?
i love dogs.

## you do?
yeah.

## what?
i don't know.

## what is that?
sounds like a harpsichord.

## can we dance to the harpsichord?
of course.

## what?
nothing.

## the cow?
oh, yeah, we didn't.

## you know what bus to take to the airport?
no problem.

## i guess this is it, no?
i really...

## you know all this bullshit we're talking about...... not seeing each other?
i don't want that.

## you don't?
i waited for you to say it.

## why didn't you say something?
i was afraid you didn't wanna see me.

## what do you wanna do?
maybe we should meet here in five years or something.

## five years?
that's a long time.

## how about one year?
one year.

## six months?
it's gonna be freezing.

## who cares?
we come here, we go somewhere else.

## six months from now or last night?
last night.

## do you speak english?
yeah.

## have you heard that as couples age...... they lose their ability to hear each other?

if they are, that represents a 5000 to 1 split of each soul...... in the last 50, 000 years, which is a blip in the earth's time.

## is that why we're so specialized?
wait a minute, i'm not sure...

## have you heard of this singer?
i think she's american.

## do you want to go see if that listening booth still works?
yeah, okay.

## yeah?
it's tiny.

## how old are these?
around the beginning of the century.

## why were all the bodies washing up?
i think some were from accidents on boats and things like that.

## that's a river, right?
yeah.

## it seems like...... this would be a... what?
you know...

## but you know what?
it doesn't matter what generation you're born into.

## did your parents divorce?
yeah, finally.

## you know, i've been wondering lately...... do you know anyone who's in a happy relationship?
yeah, sure.

## how do you know?
i know.

## oh, mr. romantic up in the ferris wheel?
oh, kiss me.

## what were you saying about her?
check these guys out.

## can i tell you a secret?
yeah.

## what?
come here.

## what?
i made eye contact.

## you want your palm read?
no.

## are you sure?
i'm sure.

## how much is it?
for you, 50.

## okay?
okay.

## that is a stranger to you?
i guess so.

## what?
she knew i was on vacation and that we didn't know each other...... and that i was going to become this great woman.

## that's way condescending, you know?
i mean, she wasn't even doing me.

## would you like that?
you're so...

## transitory?
transitory.

## you think this is open?
i don't know.

## you're close with your grandmother?
yeah.

## do you know anything about the quakers, the quaker religion?
no, not much.

## what?
it's not the appropriate place to tell it.

## would you be in paris by now if you hadn't gotten off the train?
no, not yet.

## what would you be doing?
i'd probably be hanging around the airport...... crying in my coffee because you didn't come with me.

## oh, yeah?
oh, i see.

## so i'm just a dumb american...... momentarily decorating your blank canvas, huh?
i'm having a great time.

## really?
me too.

## if we were always around each other...... what would be the first thing about me that would drive you mad?
no.

## what about me bugs you?
she flew into a rage and broke up with me.

## what is it about me bugs you?
nothing at all.

## if it had to be something, what would it be?
if it had to be something, if i had to think about it...... i kind of didn't really like this reaction at the palm reader.

## what the hell is a rooster prick?
you were like a boy whining...... because all the attention wasn't focused on him.

## this woman robs you blind, okay?
you were like a boy walking by an ice cream store...... crying because his mom won't buy him a milk shake.

## i don't care what this charlatan has to say about... what?
i understand a little, but he doesn't at all.

## may i ask you a question?
so i would like to make a deal with you.

## so?
pick a word.

## milk shake?
oh, good.

## so, were we having our first fight back there?
i think so.

## even if we were, why does everyone think conflict is so bad?
there's a lot of good things coming out of conflict.

## what do you mean?
i got a poem.

## will you read it to us?
great.

## what?
he probably didn't just write that.

## what do you mean?
nothing.

## you know what drives me crazy?
people talking about...... how great technology is, how it saves all this time.

## but what good is saved time if nobody uses it?
if it just turns into more busy work.

## what?
nothing.

## you wanna go in here?
yeah.

## wanna go?
hello.

## you gonna buy me a beer?
yeah.

## you got a boyfriend waiting on you back in paris or anything like that?
no, not right now.

## six months ago?
oh, i'm sorry.

## she was gonna kill her boyfriend?
yeah, she was.

## she had to call the police?
she was totally convinced i was really gonna do it.

## so what happened then?
i totally got over him.

## why is it you become obsessed with people you don't...... really like that much?
i don't know.

## are you with anyone?
it's funny how we managed to avoid this subject for so long.

## what?
you sound like you just were hurt.

## do i?
all right.

## your girlfriend?
my ex girlfriend...... who has been on this art history program for the last year.

## you know what's the worst thing about somebody breaking up with you?
believe me, i know.

## did it work?
didn't help your pinball.

## not lately?
that's good.

## are you talking about monkeys?
yes, i am.

## why?
i never heard this one.

## you know what?
on this island, i think there will be only, like, maybe 43 men left.

## oh, yeah?
there's something to that.

## so who just got pushed to the frontline on that one?
women say they hate it if you're all protective.

## you know what?
i don't think woman really wants to destroy man.

## you wanna stop talking about this?
i hate it.

## should i give her some money?
everything that's interesting costs a little money.

## so a birth dance, huh?
looked a little bit like a mating dance to me.

## you all don't need us?
men are lucky we don't bite off their heads after mating.

## certain insects do that, like spiders and stuff?
we let you live.

## what are you complaining about?
see, you're officially kidding.

## i always make fun of it and stuff...... but isn't everything we do in life...... a way to be loved a little more?
i don't know.

## i know, it's almost impossible to succeed...... but who cares really?
the answer must be in the attempt.

## where is the waitress?
in new york, she'd be out of a job.

## you wanna talk in english, for laughs?
yeah, okay.

## are you crazy?
probably.

## he's from there?
no, no.

## why'd you get off?
well, he convinced me.

## what?
yeah, we kissed.

## really?
i've known you a long time.

## you gonna see him again?
we haven't talked about that yet.

## what's up?
hey, frank.

## how you been?
i'm glad you're home.

## so how was madrid?
madrid sucked.

## i told you, no?
yeah, yeah.

## so are you okay now?
yeah.

## you know how they say we're all each other's demons and angels?
well, she was literally a botticelli angel...... telling me everything would be okay.

## how did you meet?
on the train.

## oh, yeah?
us men are so stupid.

## don't they?
i feel like this is some dream world we're in.

## but then the morning comes and we turn into pumpkins, right?
i know.

## but don't you think that's what...... makes our time and specific moments so important?
yeah, i know.

## what do you think?
actually, i don't know.

## you'd hate to fly, right?
i'm not so scared of flying.

## what?
no, let's just be rational adults about this.

## it's not so bad if tonight is our only night, right?
people exchange numbers, addresses.

## yeah, why?
it's stupid.

## it's the only way, no?
well, all right.

## what?
it's just...

## it's depressing, no?
now, the only thing we're gonna think of is...... when we'll have to say goodbye.

## now?
say goodbye.

## you think you can do that?
no problem.

## do you speak english?
a bit.

## a bit?
i'm having kind of an odd situation...... which is that...

## you see that girl over there?
well, this is our only night together...... and she...

## your hand?
for the greatest night in your life.

## what about our rational, adult decision?
oh, yeah.

## what?
to be kissed.

## we die in the morning, right?
i think we should.

## you don't want to see me again?
no, of course i do.

## why do we make everything so complicated?
i don't know.

## what's the first thing you'll do when you get back to paris?

## what about you?
i don't know.

## you have a dog?
i love dogs.

## you do?
yeah.

## what?
i don't know.

## what is that?
sounds like a harpsichord.

## can we dance to the harpsichord?
of course.

## what?
nothing.

## the cow?
oh, yeah, we didn't.

## you know what bus to take to the airport?
no problem.

## i guess this is it, no?
i really...

## you know all this bullshit we're talking about...... not seeing each other?
i don't want that.

## you don't?
i waited for you to say it.

## why didn't you say something?
i was afraid you didn't wanna see me.

## what do you wanna do?
maybe we should meet here in five years or something.

## five years?
that's a long time.

## how about one year?

## when are you coming back?
soon.

## okay?
i'm not hungry, though.

## all right?
don't go nowhere.

## what?
nothing.

## about making it with a guy?
no.

## clean?
yeah.

## what's up?
we have a visitor from new york.

## i got to fight it, right?
i mean, i can't go to jail.

## louis, am i right?
you are right.

## did you know... that apparently some people... do not regard the thumb, technically, to be a finger?
curious for myself, i turned to louis here... who with his newfound dictionary skills looked it up for me.

## you know what it said?
no.

## right?
right.

## what is this?
louis.

## besides, you think something like this is necessary... anyway, to intimidate people?
i say intimidation comes from within.

## but you know what's the most intimidating quality?
not that you asked.

## but the absolutely most intimidating in my opinion?
when an individual just doesn't give a shit.

## and i am very concerned... about the way things have turned out here.
louis, you want to go to medical school?

## the bleeding?
no, not him.

## fine?
it was all right.

## what were you thinking?
you were gonna extort a federal prosecutor.

## and whether you wanna call a thumb... a finger or a digit... for the sake of this discussion, it doesn't really matter.
you didn't think all hell wouldn't break loose?

## you know why?
because whatever you choose to call it... a thumb... has a fingerprint... and the one you sent... had the wrong fucking one.

## how long could we have kept below radar... with a thumbless, bleeding half wit?
you see, sometimes... one has to use their professional prerogative... to override a dumb request.

## what do you think?
we'll take brian back to where you found him and get out of here.

## are we going to the baywatch now?
no, we can't go to the baywatch now.
