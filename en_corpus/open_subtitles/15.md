## i mean, we all see the world through our own tiny keyhole, right?
i mean, i always think of thomas wolfe.

## have you ever seen that little one page\\"note to reader\"...... in the front of look homeward, angel?
so when i look at my own life, i have to admit, right, that i...

## but my life, from my own point of view, has been full of drama, right?
and so i thought, if i could write a book...... that could capture what it's like to really meet somebody...

## did i answer your question?
i'il try to be more specific.

## was there ever a french young woman on a train you met...... and spent an evening with?
see, to me, that...

## so that's a yes?
all right, since i'm in france and this is the last stop of my book tour, yes.

## like they promised?
i think how you answer that, you know, is...

## i mean, you think they get back together, right?
you don't, for sure.

## did i in real...?
to answer that would take the piss out of the whole thing.

## what is your next book?
i don't know, man.

## happiness is in the doing, right?
not in the getting what you want.

## how much longer before i have to go to the airport?
oh, you should leave at 7:30...

## good, and you?
i'm good, yeah, i'm great.

## didn't he just say you have a plane to catch?
yeah.

## yeah?
all right, well, let me...

## did you sign all these?
yeah, i sure did.

## which one's philippe?
i can't believe you're here.

## you're not supposed to talk more?
they're sick of me.

## you did?
yeah, they got a loft upstairs.

## how are you?
this is so weird.

## so you want to go to a caf?
yeah.

## how did you know i was gonna be here?
it's my favorite bookstore in paris.

## vaguely?
yeah.

## did you have a chance to read it?
yes, i...

## yeah?
yeah.

## what?
before we go anywhere, i have to ask you...

## did you?
no, i couldn't.

## but did you?
i need to know.

## well, did you?
no.

## the one in budapest?
yes.

## you remember that?
i remember everything.

## why weren't you there?
i would have been there if i could have.

## what?
oh, no.

## i'm laughing, but i don't mean it.
no, you were there, weren't you?

## did you hate me?
you must've hated me.

## have you been hating me all this time?
no.

## but you can't hate me now, right?
i mean, my grandma...

## how long were you in vienna, then?
just a couple days.

## did you meet another girl?
yeah, her name was gretchen and she was amazing.

## did you get any calls?
just a couple hookers looking for a gig.

## no, it was awful, i mean, what do you want me to say?
it's so sad.

## what did he tell you about french women?
nothing.

## why didn't you put,\\"six months later, the french bitch didn't show up\"?
no, but i did, i did.

## you did?
yeah.

## oh, what happens?
well...

## what?
we make love for about 10 days straight, that's one part of it.

## so the french slut, right?
yeah, exactly.

## so things are going well for you, right?
i mean...

## why should they read my book?
i haven't read moby dick and i liked your book.

## come on, it's fiction, right?
i'm supposed to...

## well, i mean, her, right?
no, me.

## you think i'm neurotic?
no, no, no.

## where did i do that?
i didn't do that.

## how is it disturbing?
i don't know.

## how long did it take you to write it?
three or four years, on and off.

## what?
i've wanted to talk to you for so long that now...

## it's just surreal, you know?
i feel like everything should be...

## twenty minutes and 30 seconds?
we got more than that.

## where to start?
i work for green cross.

## what are they all about?
we basically work on different environment issues...... from clean water to disarmament of chemical weapons.

## what do you do for them?
we're going this way.

## but how'd you get into that?
i came out of political science, hoping to work for the government.

## not good?
yeah, no.

## so i decided what i really wanted to do was...... to find things that could be fixed and try to fix them, you know?
you know, i always thought you'd be doing something cool like that.

## i just feel really, really lucky to be doing a job i like, you know?
yeah.

## how could you possibly say that?
well, i just mean, you know, like...

## how is the world getting better?
i'm not angry, i'm not angry.

## what?
stop.

## is there any particular imperialist country you have in mind, there, frenchie?
no, not really.

## so you wanna sit over there?
yeah, this is perfect.

## am i improving?
i don't know.

## when i was younger, i was healthier...... but i was wracked with insecurity, you know?
now i'm older and my problems are deeper...... but i'm more equipped to handle them.

## so, what are your problems?
right now i don't have any.

## i don't, you know?
i'm just...... damn happy to be here.

## so how long have you been in paris?
i got in last night.

## i'm so glad it's over, you know?
i'm tired of being a huckster.

## what do you want?
a cup of coffee.

## you were living in the u. s.?
yes, from '96 to '99.

## what?
no, it's just...

## what?
i've been living in new york since '98.

## in new york?
yeah.

## it actually crossed my mind a few times that i might run into you...... but the odds are so slim, right?
so...

## weren't you somewhere in texas?
yeah, yeah, definitely.

## what brought you back here?
i had finished my master's, for one...... and no visa, no more visa.

## okay?
and i said to him,\\"i have no idea how to shoot a gun...... and i have no interest in firearms whatsoever.

## the way that cop had pulled his gun out, and everything, right?
so i canceled my demand for the gun...... and i called the police and tried to complain about that cop.

## what happened with that?
it was so much paperwork...... and then i got scared, with my shitty student visa...

## thought you'd get deported?
exactly.

## like what?
well...

## have you noticed?
no, everybody seems pretty happy to me.

## they're not happy?
no, they are.

## what about them?
well, they're very nice.

## what do you mean?
well, i guess they're not as...

## horny?
they're not as horny.

## horny?
wait, listen to me on this one.

## have you ever spent time in eastern europe?
eastern...

## communist ideas?
listen, i'm not...

## nine years?
no, that's impossible.

## i do?
i'd have to see you naked.

## what?
i know, i'm sorry.

## well?
voil.

## so?
okay, come on.

## did you think i was fat before?
no...

## seriously, all right?
you look beautiful.

## do i look any different?
no.

## like a gunshot wound?
no, no, no.

## i like getting older, you know?
life feels...

## you were?
yeah.

## could i have a drag of that?
well, your book has been published.

## are you enjoying every minute of it?
not really.

## not really?
no.

## do you have another one of those?
yes, of course.

## what do you mean, exactly?
i was working for this organization that helped villages in mexico.

## i mean, i feel like i'm...... designed to be slightly dissatisfied with everything, you know?
it's like always trying to better my situation.

## and then i think, to hell with it, right?
desire's the fuel of life.

## do you think it's true...... that if we never wanted anything, we'd never be unhappy?
i don't know.

## i mean, it's healthy to desire, right?
yeah.

## it's what all those buddhist guys say, right?
liberate yourself from desire, and you'il find...... you already have everything you need.

## i like that we have those ever renewing desires, you know?
maybe it's this sense of entitlement.

## you know, like whenever you feel like you deserve that new pair of shoes?
it's okay to want things, as long as you aren't pissed off if you don't get them.

## so, what, are you buddhist, or something?
no.

## why not?
i don't know.

## trappist?
yeah, they're catholic.

## why?
i'd been doing some reading.

## have you ever spent any time with monks or nuns?
no.

## no?
well, i expected them to be all glowering and stern, but they weren't.

## i want to be a better person,\\"you know?
you can't escape.

## it all comes down to that, doesn't it?
that's why i really admire what you're doing.

## sucking cock?
no.

## no?
wrong answer.

## you know something?
i'm gonna be on planes...... and in an airport for the next eight hours...

## would you walk with me?
yeah.

## do you mind?
that's great.

## do you want to?
let's do that.

## four fifty?
no, i got it, i got a little per diem going on here.

## this good, for a tip?
yeah, that's fine.

## is there anywhere to go around here?
it's sales day today.

## what's that?
it's when everything's on sale in paris.

## is this where we're going?
yeah.

## are you ever in therapy?
oh, no.

## do i seem like i'm in therapy?
i'm kidding.

## my sex problems?
i'm kidding.

## that's a joke, right?
no, we didn't.

## was it in the cemetery?
no.

## in the park?
wait a minute, wait a minute.

## in the park?
okay.

## are you messing with me?
okay.

## i mean, you're right, okay?
sometimes i put things in drawers inside my head and forget about it.

## what, so that night was, like, a sad memory for you?
i didn't mean that night in particular.

## really?
well, i thought i did.

## why?
i don't know.

## reading your book, maybe?
no, but...

## can i put that on a bumper sticker?
if you wrote a book about our night, that's a good title.

## what?
now that we've met again...... we can change our memory of that december 16.

## what?
she was so obsessed with it that, later in life, you know...... i had this image in my head that this really happened.

## could we?
no.

## did you ever keep a journal when you were a kid?
yeah.

## yeah?
and what really surprised me is...... that i was dealing with life the same way i am now.

## you believe that?
i think so.

## the same?
yeah.

## so i'il be forever depressed no matter what great things happen?
definitely.

## no, come on, are you depressed now?
no, no, i'm not depressed.

## well, what do you want to do?
i...

## do you believe in ghosts or spirits?
no.

## no?
no.

## okay, what about reincarnation?
not at all.

## god?
no.

## there we go.
so then, astrology?

## that makes sense, right?
you're a scorpio, i'm a sag, we get along.

## what is important?
you know, every day's our last.

## are you gonna commit suicide?
it's almost not worth it.

## what about us?
no, what i mean is...... if we were both going to die tonight...

## like the apocalypse was coming?
no, that's too dramatic...

## the environment?
or...

## what would you tell me?
well...

## that's hard, huh?
no, no, i'il do it.

## why not do it right there on a bench?
come here, come here, come here.

## but why not?
no, this example, this friend of mine, she was talking about...

## why?
totally.

## what, more than women?
definitely on that subject.

## you think so?
yeah, yeah.

## to please?
well, i don't know.

## what, written down, or out loud?
yeah, mostly written down.

## are you into s & m?
no, but a good spanking once in a while doesn't hurt.

## that kind of thing?
yeah, but not just like any dirty talk.

## what, me?
well, yeah.

## for example what specific word would you like to hear?
i don't know.

## what do you feel about the word\\"pussy\"?
i love it.

## so, what kind of songs do you write?
i didn't know you did that.

## what kind?
yeah, sure.

## like?
like, some are about, you know, people.

## why not?
no, okay.

## you want to meet here in six months with a guitar?
i'il fly all the way over here.

## so you're flying back to new york?
yeah, yeah.

## what's his name?
henry.

## your wife, what does she do?
she teaches elementary school.

## do you have kids?
no, i'm kidding.

## no?
i'm in a good relationship, though.

## oh yeah?
that's good.

## what's he do?
he's a photojournalist.

## aren't a lot of those guys getting killed these days?
he promises me he doesn't take risks, but i often worry.

## what do you mean?
well, once we were in new delhi...... and we passed a bum on the...

## a bomb?
a bum.

## but don't you have to be like that to be good at that job?
yeah, i mean, i'm not...

## do you have a cell phone?
yeah.

## what guy?
the war photographer.

## so do you have that cell phone?
oh, yeah.

## what do i tell him?
tell him to pick you up at quai henri quatre.

## quai...?
henri quatre.

## no, do you want me to...?
henri quatre.

## come on, why didn't you say so?
i'm sorry.

## yeah, is this philippe?
yeah.

## well, listen, i'm on one of those boats, right?
and we're gonna arrive at henry four.

## you know what that is?
all right, great.

## and you have my bags, right?
yeah, so we'il be there in...

## it's okay?
yeah, yeah.

## is that true?
i don't know.

## what, right in the same spot?
yeah.

## really crazy, right?
now i know for sure.

## so you'd come to a reading in paris...... and i could walk up to you and ask,\\"where the fuck were you?
no...

## you think i'd be here today?
i'm serious.

## what were the chances of us ever meeting again?
after that december, i'd say almost zero.

## but we're not real anyway, right?
we're just characters in that old lady's dream.

## why weren't you there in vienna?
i told you why.

## you think so?
i actually do.

## what, like we hate each other now?
you know, maybe we're...

## why didn't we do that?
because we were young and stupid.

## do you think we still are?
i guess when you're young you just believe...... there'il be many people you'il connect with.

## that everything's fated?
well, you know, the world might be less free than we think.

## yeah?
when given these exact circumstances, that's what will happen every time.

## days, even?
things might have been different.

## so, what is it like to be married?
you haven't talked much about that.

## i haven't?
how weird.

## what?
we were sort of back together and she was pregnant...... so marriage.

## what is she like?
she's a great teacher, a good mom.

## so you got married because men you admired were married?
no, no.

## this idea of my best self, you know?
and i wanted to pursue that...... even if it might have been overriding my honest self.

## you know what i'm saying?
in the moment, i remember thinking it didn't much matter, the who of it all.

## i mean, what is love, right, if it's not respect, trust, admiration?
and i...

## you laughing at me?
no.

## what monastery do monks have sex...?
okay, you're right, i'm doing better than most monks.

## what?
you're not that happy with your marriage.

## how's she doing?
she's a mess, but...

## what reason is that?
they all expected, after a few years of living together...... for the passion, that desire, to be the same.

## and thank god...... we'd end up with aneurysms in that constant state of excitement, right?
we'd do nothing at all with our lives.

## would you have finished your book if you were fucking every five minutes?
i might have welcomed the challenge, i mean...

## that wouldn't make any sense, right?
everything you're saying makes sense.

## why don't we just give you a ride home?
well, i can take the mtro.

## monsieur, can...?
it's not on the way.

## you told him where you are and all that?
yeah.

## he knows where he's going?
yes.

## but this is better than the mtro, right?
definitely.

## is that why you're in a relationship with somebody who's never around?
yes, obviously i can't deal with the day to day life of a relationship.

## it's not, right?
you know, it's not even that.

## it stirred shit up, you know?
i don't feel things for people anymore.

## you know what?
reality and love are almost contradictory for me.

## but what does it mean, the right man, the love of your life?
the concept is absurd.

## can i talk?
i guess i've been heartbroken too many times and then i recovered.

## i'm so glad you didn't forget about me, okay?
no, i didn't.

## and it pisses me off, okay?
you come here to paris, all romantic, and married.

## okay?
screw you.

## you did?
yes.

## i don't feel pain or excitement, i'm not even bitter, i'm just...
they do?

## you think you're the one dying inside?
my life is 24/ 7 bad.

## did the candles help?
hell, no.

## but then, there's no joy or laughter in my home, you know?
i don't want him growing up in that.

## no laughter?
that's terrible.

## what dreams?
and i wake up with the fucking sweats.

## and i touch you anyway...... right on your ankle, and your skin is so soft that i wake up in sobs, all right?
my wife is there looking at me, and i feel i'm a million miles from her.

## why are you telling me all this?
i'm sorry.

## this is where you live?
yeah.

## so you're just relieved that i'm in even more deep shit than you are?
yes, you've made me feel better.

## you think so?
yeah...... a few antidepressants, you know, you'il do great.

## you ready?
okay.

## what?
i want to see if you stay together or if you dissolve into molecules.

## how am i doing?
still here.

## is this your apartment?
no, i live down there.

## down there?
yeah.

## this is where you live?
yeah.

## how long have you been here?
four years.

## is it all true about your dreams...... or did you say that to hopefully get in my pants?
i said that to get in your pants.

## does it work?
you know.

## you know what i love about this cat?
every morning i bring him to the courtyard...... and every single morning he looks at everything like it was the first time.

## what's his name?
che.

## what?
commie.

## i was thinking, would you play me one of your songs?
you're gonna miss your flight.

## one song?

## what do you say?
well, joe, you see...

## see anybody else coming?
no.

## how far is ryker gonna push us?
let him say.

## he didn't, did he?
joey, i want you to go to sleep.

## shane isn't going away?
no, he isn't.

## yes?
don't get to liking shane too much.

## why not?
i don't want you to.

## is there anything wrong with him?
no.

## then what, mother?
he'il be moving on one day, joey.

## think i can get ready as quickly as you?
hold your horses, we wanted to see how pretty you were.

## morning.
all set?

## are you all set?
we agreed to come together.

## my jars come yet?
howdy, starrett.

## did you bring your mother's list?
yes, pa.

## we make big celebration, don't we, marian?
fine, that's just what we need.

## how about some of those jellies...?
we'il talk about that later.

## what do i get for the empty?
the usual.

## what's the matter, pete?
just say i'm superstitious, that's all.

## did you hear me?
i said get going.

## did you think you were gonna come and drink with the men?
set 'em up, bartender.

## anything to stop you drawin 'your time?
i like working for starrett.

## what are you looking for?
nothing.

## you wouldn't want me to run away, would you?
but there's too many, shane.

## how are you feeling?
better.

## would you, shane?
i'm afraid i would, joey, if it hurt bad enough.

## will you kiss me goodnight, mother?
all right.

## what is it, joey?
mother...

## do you?
i love him almost as much as i love pa.

## that's all right, isn't it?
he's a fine man.

## don't you like him, mother?
yes, i like him, too, joey.

## what's the matter, honey?
he's getting a little sleep.

## where's the coffee?
i'il put it right on.

## what's going on here?
plenty.

## looks that way, don't it?
don't let 'em bluff you, ernie.

## see that?
they killed my sow last night.

## what do you think of that, stonewall torrey?
starrett and the rest of us are gonna take the juice out of 'em, one of these days.

## ma, you getting ready?
good luck.

## shane, what would you do if you caught them cutting our fence?
i guess i don't see as many bad men as you do.

## you want me to tell you something?
if you want to.

## are you mad?
no, i guess not.

## could i see it again?
you promised you'd show me how to shoot.

## so when your hand comes up, the gun clears the holster without coming up too high, see?
no, joey.

## which is the best way?
what i'm telling you is as good as any, better than most.

## you see, joey?
now look.

## why do you always have to spoil everything?
a gun is a tool, no better or worse than any other tool, an axe, a shovel, or anything.

## you got to admit, my men have kept their six guns cased.
what's all the shooting about?

## and now?
i can guess what's on your mind.

## what's the matter with you?
no offence, rufe.

## something i can do you for?
a jug.

## is that one of them?
i'm from wyoming.

## what did he say, joe?
i gave up my independence 10 years ago today.

## what were you doing in town?
joe, i want to dance.

## who was that?
stranger, decked out like a gunfighter.

## did you say\\"guns\"?
yeah, two guns.

## what did he look like?
packs two guns, kinda lean...

## is he a friend of yours?
no.

## jack wilson?
gunfighter outta cheyenne.

## can't be him, can it?
i didn't ask him his name.

## pow wow with ryker?
don't start.

## if you saw him?
maybe.

## who?
that man torrey seen in town.

## do you think that was wilson?
don't worry about things like that.

## who goes there?
brother rufe's come to pay you a little visit.

## how'd you like to work for me?
i work for myself.

## is that fair?
you've made things hard for us, and we're in the right.

## you in the right?
when i came to this country, you weren't much older than your boy.

## the men that did the work and ran the risks have no rights?
i take you for a fair man, starrett.

## what about the others?
shane knows he can work for me.

## you don't give a man much choice.
the other homesteaders?

## would you like to go partners with me?
i don't want trouble with your father.

## how about it, son?
come here, joey.

## what do you make of him?
he's no cow puncher.

## why don't we just gun him and get on with it?
one's run already.

## where do you think you're going?
to get a whiskey.

## anything wrong with that?
it's just funny.

## or would you know?
i'm saying that\\"stonewall\\"jackson was trash himself.

## what?
he tried to pull on wilson.

## ain't that right, swede?
he tried to reach for a...

## you understand that, swede?
now get him outta here.

## what happened?
the sodbuster tried to kill wilson.

## what's the shooting?
sodbuster tried to pull on wilson.

## what happened?
we go to town together.

## what started it?
i passed lewis, his missus and johnson.

## who saw it?
just the ryker men and me.

## what are you going to do, joe?
go to town.

## what goes on?
we're going on.

## shipstead, would you please lead us in the lord's prayer?
our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.

## you want us to stay for more of this?
we can have a regular settlement.

## who's ryker to run us away from our own homes?
he only wants to grow beef, and we want to grow families, to grow them good and strong, the way they were meant to be grown.

## can't we?
right.

## me, too, i'il help.
we'il get the timber and put it right back up, right?

## all that, just for us?
not just for you, martha, for all of us in this valley.

## what does that leave us with?
give me time.

## who's gonna fight ryker?
he knows he's got us on the run.

## hang on?
i promise something's gonna be done.

## but what, joe?
leave that to me.

## that's right, isn't it, shane?
i can't tell joe what's right, marian.

## who is it?
peace party, from ryker.

## you wanna be reasonable, don't you?
i always figured on being reasonable.

## who else?
not us.

## who is it?
calloway.

## what do you want?
maybe this is a chance.

## doesn't joey?
marian...

## how would i explain that to him?
don't let him go.

## are you fighting for this shack, this ground and nothing but work?
i'm sick of it, i'm sick of trouble.

## some way?
it's no use, joe.

## what's stopping me?
i am.

## am i gonna have to fight you, too?
that depends on you.

## are you doing this just for me?
for you, marian...... and joe and little joe.

## then we'il never see you again?
never's a long time, marian.

## why did shane...?
shane did what he had to do.

## where's starrett?
you're dealing with me, ryker.

## what's your offer, ryker?
to you, not a thing.

## and yours, gunfighter?
the difference is i know it.

## so we'il turn in our six guns to the bartender, and we'il all start hoeing spuds, is that it?
not quite yet.

## it ain't with me, wilson?
no, it ain't, shane.

## what's that mean to you, shane?
i've heard about you.

## what have you heard, shane?
i've heard that you're a low down, yankee liar.

## was that wilson?
that was him.

## joey, what are you doing here?
i'm sorry, shane.

## can't i ride home behind you?
i gotta be going on.

## why, shane?
a man has to be what he is, joey.

## more?
and, indeed, to meet a queen.

## where is it?
yes.

## sheepherding demonstration?
free air travel, accommodations... and a generous appearance fee.

## not every human is as kind as ours.
pig?

## do not take counsel of your fears, lad.
but what can i do?

## do you want to pee before you go?
uh, no, thank you.

## can you come with me, fly?
i wish i could, dear, but it's you they want.

## please?
stop it, now.

## esme?
uh huh.

## any idea where it's headed?
follow us.

## comprende?
whoa.

## you see 'em?
yes.

## when you sniff the right smell, do ya know what happens?
mm mmm.

## why?
beats me, but it's sure important.

## rewards?
sure.

## esme cordelia hoggett?
oh.

## pardon?
scram, lady.

## what kind of establishment do you think this is?
well, it isn't.

## am i aware of the city codes and regulations?
yes.

## am i one to break the law?
absolutely not.

## how long did you want to stay?
i, uh two days.

## heartless meanies.
will an attic room do?

## ls he house trained?
oh, yes.

## do we provide meals?
no.

## but is there a convenience store?
yes.

## and what is the golden rule?
never answer the front door.

## why?
it might be an inspector.

## what happens if you need anything?
you knock on this door on the left.

## who lives there?
i do.

## where's the bathroom?
end of the landing.

## little puppy dog?
flealick, come back.

## do we, alan?
no, nigel.

## how do i know?
ln the foyer.

## and where does the little piggy stay at all times?
ln the kitty litter.

## who empties it?
you do.

## any questions?
oh.

## where do i make a long distance phone call?
oh, uh, two blocks south.

## i beg your pardon?
it's, uh, kind of a baldy, pinky, whitey thingy.

## you wanna break his heart?
but it doesn't belong to him.

## who's to say it belongs to you?
i'm not leaving without the bag.

## and what have we here?
well, uh, we're in a negotiation... with this naked, pink individual.

## so, will this little pink\\"lunchness\"... fulfill his destiny, nourishmentally speaking?
please let me out.

## can you imagine?
esme hoggett, fugly floom.

## did you get that?
approximately five minutes ago something that looked like a pig exited this establishment.

## where did he go?
not you.

## and the animals had told him if all went well... there would be big rewards.
y you know  what's in the bag?

## sir, i gotta get going now.
uh, h hey, so, when do i get paid?

## just tell me.
how do i collect my reward?

## was there ever such a thing?
oh, little pink thingy, this is the city.

## as bob always says what do you say, bob?
it's all illusory it's ill, and it's for losers.

## get my drift?
i'm not a pork pie.

## where was the boss's wife?
i couldn't wake him.

## thelonius?
easy, let him be.

## hey, dogs, you got any edibles, any nibbly dibblies?
we got a carpet here with some nice spaghetti stains.

## but we can't keep licking the carpet, can we, alan?
no, nigel.

## without a human?
could be kinda dangerous, you know, in a lethally sort of way.

## what can you do?
you don't even have any hands.

## what can i do?
uh, lots.

## you do?
uh huh.

## border leicester or scottish blackface?
pit bull and a doberman pinscher.

## uh, where do you want me to herd them?
that's up to you.

## uh, anybody else?
i have been cruelly cast out and have nowhere to go.

## oh, b but how?
please.

## where's your human?
my humans belong to someone else now.

## uh, could that be food?
oh, have mercy.

## anybody else?
fine by moi.

## anybody else else?
it's still just a pig.

## they'il soil willy nilly, won't they, alan?
willy nilly, nigel.

## should i have let you drown?
most would have.

## here.
will someone slap the dog?

## what?
mmm.

## what's wrong?
um...

## who's like us?
you look different.

## huh?
okay, you're gonna be all right.

## you got him?
easy.

## you got him?
reel him in.

## cats?
no, that does it.

## someone help me.
think we can get out of here without either one of us getting hurt?

## what is that?
get it out of here.

## a are you okay?
just flip me over.

## what are you doing?
it's all in the hooter.

## the what?
the olfactory instrument.

## would you help me off with this, please?
oh, boy.

## what are you doing?
i, l i'm not dressed.

## mr. thelonius?
time to go.

## when is something nice gonna happen to me?
pig.

## what happened?
i thought i could make a place where we would all be okay.

## but how can you do that here?
this used to be a lovely neighborhood.

## clothes.
why couldn't they just leave us be?

## where are our animals?
i'm not going across there.

## yeah, for my babies?
there is a place i know, but it's ever so far away.

## how do we get there?
well, first we have to find my human.

## darling?
there you are.

## huh?
quietly.

## mrs. willis.   any pain?
no, very little.

## what kind?
pig, cats, dogs, monkeys, that sort of thing.

## huh?
you're comin 'with me, porky.

## what's wrong?
i think i dropped a baby.

## what do you mean, you dropped a baby?
i must have dropped the other baby.

## give me your snarl.
hello?

## but, dad, do we have to?
we are replicators.

## you would do that?
they won t leave me.

## who's replacing you sir?
her name is doctor elizabeth weir.

## a civilian?
she's an expert in international politics.

## are you saying the lost city of the ancients is here?
the city we've been looking for is under the ice at antarctica.

## so in the meanwhile, jack just stays frozen in a stasis pod down there?
it's not that we can't use it.

## what about colonel o'neill?
look, i know what he means to the three of you.

## what do you suggest we do?
you're aware of how we helped the asgard trap the replicators in a time dilation field on the planet halla.

## that was a couple of years ago, right?
basically we know that, that trap is only going to hold them for so long.

## isn't the planet you're talking about, in another galaxy?
othalla.

## and back?
that might be a problem.

## if you get there and it turns out, you can't contact the asgard?
we're willing to take the risk.

## for what reason?
colonel o'neill was able to fend off anubis 'fleet, using the weapons from the ancients outpost.

## what can i do for you major?
i want you to reconsider my request.

## can i get you anything?
i packed lots of turkey, i know that's your favourite.

## have you been able to determine how o'neill modified the engines?
no, i'm just taking a break.

## i'm sorry, have i been ignoring you?
i'm fine.

## concerning what subject?
i don't know.

## how's ryac?
fine.

## are you still keeping in touch with ishta?
indeed.

## bra'tac?
bra'tac is well.

## how is pete shanahan?
he's fine.

## is all not well, between the two of you?
no, everything is great.

## we were attacked from space by an armada of alien ships, if that doesn't get us past our distrust of each other, what will?
you forget that those alien ships were destroyed by a single weapon.

## it's goa'uld.
unauthorized offworld activation!

## what does it say?
it's from one of the system lords, camulus, celtic god of war.

## woow yeah, of course, woow?
sorry, it say's he wants to arrange a meeting for the purpose of negotiating a treaty.

## a goa'uld wants to arrange a treaty with us?
not just one goa'uld.

## should we not be able to see the planet?
yes.

## you sure that this is an accurate translation of the message?
pretty much.

## are we that far off course?
no, we came out of hyperspace, right where we were supposed to.

## you don't think i can handle it?
i didn't say that, but if i may, you don't sound all that confident.

## why should i be nervous?
seems like an average day at the united nations.

## so what can you tell me?
the high council of the system lords, is a rather flimsy coalition of the most powerful goa'ulds in the galaxy.

## so the goa'uld have agreed to our terms, for their travel here?
yeah.

## yu?
don't.

## well why would they choose him as a representative?
the others may be doing a good job of covering for him.

## that's the bright side?
more of a slightly less, dark side.

## what is your mission?
the mass of replicator blocks have begun moving away from the event horizon.

## how is that possible?
they have the time dilation device.

## into what?
a ship.

## heard anything from teal'c and sam?
no.

## really?
i generally find it helps so much.

## have you ever seen anything like it?
no, and it is doubtful my ships weapons will be effective against it.

## can you jump into hyperspace?
we must clear the gravitational distortion from above the black hole first.

## can it penetrate your shields?
it is more than likely.

## where?
the damage is minimal.

## can you use the shields to prevent decompression in those sections?
yes.

## orac?
unspeakable.

## is she in your presence?
i did not do it.

## can you follow?
yes.

## if ba'al defeats us, how long do you think it will be before he turns his attention to you?
if he does he'il suffer the same fate as anubis.

## what are you talking about?
we could not help but notice that the asgard did not come to your aid, when anubis threatened your planet.

## really?
that's odd, because we talk to them all the time.

## do you know it's destination?
before you destroyed them, the replicators managed to access the shp computer.

## what is your reasoning?
orilla is rich in neutronium.

## how many planets are protected under this treaty?
26.

## and what good is it if the asgard aren't actually available to protect anything?
at one time they were.

## too dramatic?
at this point, not for me.

## how can we stop them?
my ships weapons will not function in hyperspace, much like the shields.

## you think you deserve better?
no.

## what exactly are you offering?
hyperdrive engines.

## i think the real question is, how many ships do you have?
i mean, if we're gonna enforce this treaty ourselves, we need to build enough ships to match any fleet that would oppose us.

## we will?
in exchange, we want ba'al's territory.

## well that's the way it works right?
when one system lord kills another, he takes over his armies, his fleet, his planets.

## if we're gonna be the one's who destroy ba'al for you, why should we settle for anything less?
preposterous.

## always bet big when bluffing?
i just didn't know you wanted to become a system lord.

## what?
you can't change what happened.

## is this making you feel better?
i never intended to abandon you.

## progress?
yeah.

## what is the meaning of this?
sending ships here to attack us, is an act of war, and a foolish one at that, given what our defenses are capable of.

## so, what can we do?
thor believes the ancients knowledge stored in o'neills mind, may be the key to defeating the replicators once and for all.

## where's sam?
she was captured by the replicators.

## is something wrong?
yes, everything.

## what do you mean?
this.

## where the hell is here?
that was good.

## you don't what?
think this is real.

## you hungry?
i'm starving.

## you've had a bad one ok?
that's it.

## did that feel real?
yes.

## pancakes, or do i have to call the doctor?
i'm kind of hungry.

## what are you going to do?
i'm going to merge o'neill's mind, with the ships computer.

## to do that, you're going to have to defrost him first, right?
i bring this up, because he was near death when we froze him.

## well, can't you just save him, like the last time this happened?
just wipe the ancient knowledge from his mind.

## can't you just extract the ancient information into the ships computer?
then we can all benefit from it.

## you requested to see me?
you must let us go.

## what would you have me do?
free us to fight.

## jack?
o'neill.

## hey guys.
can you hear us?

## what?
the name of thor's ship is daniel jackson.

## i can pretty much anything i want, cant i?
it's a little weird.

## can you help with the replicators?
that is definitely not pete.

## why are you doing this?
because i love you.

## what is it?
i am unsure.

## jack, can you hear me?
i must revive him now.

## what's the last thing you remember?
getting my head sucked, by one of those dang ancient head suckers.

## what's with the hair?
o'neill.

## you got an aspirin?
you should feel better momentarily and your memory will slowly return.

## teal'c, what's with the hair?
the specifications for the device you created, remain in the computer.

## what is it?
we don't know, but you made it.

## were you able to procure means of fighting the replicators?
possibly.

## can you scan the planet for life signs?
we already have.

## can you hear me?
we have lost contact...

## that i would just accept it?
if it was something you wanted badly enough, in your mind.

## is that why you tortured me for so long?
so i would want this as an alternative.

## most intriguing.
why do you think i hated you so much for what you did to me?

## can you make it work?
to be honest, i am unsure of exactly what it is.

## what have you to report?
we have located what appears to be the remains of a human form replicator, floating in space.

## where are you going?
i am going to transport it aboard.

## why?
we must learn the location of the human form controlling the replicators on the planet.

## anybody recognise him?
no.

## is it dead?
hopefully, not completely.

## and if he wakes up, can this pod get a hold of him?
probably not.

## what's that?
replicator communication data.

## sam.
what?

## can you pinpoint her location?
she is in a small replicator structure on the planet.

## i mean we can use this thing to whack the rest of those bugs?
even better, o'neill.

## what?
this could be very bad.

## what is happening o'neill?
we must leave.

## why?
they've found a means to fight us.

## how?
the one you call o'neill.

## what?
so many of us are left in the city.

## you know why my friends won't stop, just to save me?
no.

## how are you feeling?
not bad.

## do you know what they're having?
i don't think i've had the chance to personally thank you yet.

## for what?
you risk your life over and over, and ask for nothing in return.

## are you going somewhere?
as a matter of fact, the president has asked me to supervise the research of the ancient outpost.

## do we know this shrub?
well you know him rather well.

## me?
yeah, you.

## i do?
on the flip side of the coin, there's the fact that no one knows how this place should be run, better than you.

## am i supposed to hold my breath?
the poison is only deadly to symbiotes.

## what are you talking about?
they call themselves the trust.

## what's going on?
yeah.

## were you detecting any signs of gate activity?
no, sir.

## did anyone approach the gate at any time?
no, sergeant, i think it's safe to say there was nothing you could have done.

## you were getting coffee?
um... we... it...

## is it just me or does that look like an asgard beam?
it does... which makes no sense.

## why would they take our gate?
usually they ask nicely before they ignore us and do whatever they damn well please.

## didn't the asgard install beam technology as well as a hyperdrive?
yeah, it's in the hangar.

## you think ba'al stole our gate?
to be honest, right now i don't know what to think.

## is teal'c still on p4s 161?
yeah, his meeting with the rebel jaffa leaders should be over by now.

## what is the situation?
we've been out of contact with earth for seven hours now.

## find anything?
yeah, as a matter of fact i have.

## what was that?
i don't know, but i checked the time code and this corresponds with the exact moment that the sensors began recording the anomaly.

## you think it's the trust?
well, they've been busy lately.

## you think the anomaly was a locator beacon?
yeah, which hartkins placed directly on the gate.

## so my stamp collection is safe how does that help us find the gate?
well, if they wanna keep using the beam, they'il have to keep using the beacons.

## what has happened here?
when i arrived, they were all dead.

## all?
i will show you.

## what's this?
methylphosphonothioic acid.

## which is?
nerve gas.

## what would the ex nld be doing stockpiling this stuff?
it's too late.

## you see?
we managed to identify the liquid we found in the warehouse.

## i believe you've been briefed on our situation?
yes, i have.

## you see?
right where we left it.

## why would they suddenly decide to use it now?
perhaps the failure of the alliance convinced them that there is no other way.

## without sympathetic warriors in zaren's ranks, how do you plan to avoid being captured?
we do not.

## you realise the second you walk through that gate, you're on your own?
understood.

## who?
you were followed.

## what happened?
we've got an uninvited guest.

## are you certain?
i am.

## lord ba'al will be most pleased, will he not?
yes, of course.

## and we can also choose to ignore your two million dollar cayman island account.
i'm gonna ask you again, where's colonel carter?

## so if i help you, i can keep the money?
we can come to an arrangement.

## my lord?
we must speak with you.

## you said colonel carter was missing?
well, she's probably on the ship.

## what do you mean?
one day i was in the lab working on the adapter.

## can you get the wrist device to work again?
absolutely.

## where are we?
we're in a polar orbit around the moon...

## you realise you're killing millions of innocent jaffa?
spare me, colonel.

## what about the rebel jaffa?
they're growing in numbers every day.

## what's the next target?
p3s 114.

## why are you here?
we know about the attacks.

## what attacks?
the tok'ra have been using the symbiont poison against the goa'uld.

## how do you explain this?
i cannot.

## what was that?
my lord.

it looks totally normal.

## what?
i said great.

## what am i supposed to say?
gee, i can't wait to live in some depressing shit hole...

## out in the middle of nowhere\"?
you know, you hate every single place that we look at.

## why don't you just tell me you don't want to live with me?
because you'il totally freak out and act like a psycho about it.

## what?
you're the psycho.

## what's wrong?
nothing.

## what?
all artists have to suffer.

## what do you mean?
well, the whole business with the art show... and the newspaper it's just absolutely...

## well, i'm sorry, enid  can you help me out here?
i can't breath under this mask.

## hey, what are you doing here?
i needed to see you.

## can you at least let me in?
yeah, sure.

## do you have anything to drink?
there might be some root beer.

## what's this?
yeah, sure.

## what is this?
dana got it when we went shopping for antiques.

## how come all that time i was trying to get you a date... you never asked me out?
you're a beautiful young girl.

## what?
i used to think about one day... just not telling anyone and going off to some random place.

## do you ever think about stuff like that?

## you know what we should do?
we should just get in your car right now and just drive off.

## don't you like me?

## did you mean all that stuff about moving in with me?
i was just thinking out loud.

## so, what brings you down here?

## why would she be hiding from me?
i don't know.

## fuck with me?
high school is like the training wheels... for the bicycle of real life.

## what?
these assholes are saying i have to go to summer school... and take some stupid art class.

## why?
god, i didn't think that just because you get an\\"f\"... you have to take the whole class over again.

## why?
don't turn around.

## so, what are you guys doing this summer?
hey, enid.

## so, we finally made it, huh?
yeah.

## so, where are you going to go to college?

## what are you talking about?
that's who people want to rent to.

## what, are you making pancakes?
not if i can't find that goddamn spatula.

## god, how long have you been standing there?

have some chips.

## you open?
yeah.

## i was born?
you should shit or get off the pot.

## what are you talking about?
i'm talking about this thing you have, this inability to improve your station in life.

## all right, if you hate this job and the people... and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, why don't you quit?
like it's that easy. it is.

## so what's stoppin 'you?
leave me alone.

## oh, you're comfortable, right?
this is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it... would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.

## things that probably ruined my chances with caitlin.
am i right or what?

## oh, what, the dead guy?
she'il get over fuckin 'a dead guy.

## yes, some of the things you're saying are true\"?

## how's your eye?
the swelling's not that bad, but the f. d. s. stings.

## why did you tell veronica that i was gonna dump her to go back with caitlin?
i thought i was doing you a favor.

## no, really.
why do you say that?

## what don't you do?
sometimes i think the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.

## all right, if you hate this job and the people... and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, why don't you quit?
like it's that easy. it is.

## so what's stoppin 'you?
leave me alone.

## oh, you're comfortable, right?

she'il get over fuckin 'a dead guy.

## why did you tell veronica that i was gonna dump her to go back with caitlin?
i thought i was doing you a favor.

like it's that easy. it is.

## so what's stoppin 'you?
leave me alone.

## oh, you're comfortable, right?

## why did you tell veronica that i was gonna dump her to go back with caitlin?
i thought i was doing you a favor.

a tournament.

## so how do i...?
there's a boat.

## ls this the place?
yes.

## what happened?
after you left for america... he followed in your footsteps.

## grandfather... it wasn't enough to fill my head with that nonsense?
to save the world is not nonsense.

## how can a wise man believe this?
we all believe in it... including your brother.

## why have you come back?
i want to represent the order of light at the tournament.

## for what reason?
my brother's killer will be there.

## that's why you left the temple... and ran away, isn't it?
the great tournament was too much responsibility.

## rayden?
grandfather, get up.

## so, you're going to win the tournament?
yes, i am.

## why didn't you?
i've had enough of this.

## aren't you art lean?
i saw you fight in london, you're great.

## you want me to carry your luggage?
i pay money.

## or is that too complicated?
no.

## what is that?
you must be kidding me.

## alright, tough guy, you want to get... tough?
no.

## do you?
i'm johnny cage.

## where's kano?
i don't know who you're talking about.

## just another starstruck fan, huh?
i'm honored to finally meet you.

## got that radio handy?
scorpion and sub zero.

## what tournament?
you've been chosen, sonya.

## who is he?
let's think this through.

## defend it from who?
your world is but one of many realms.

## lf this guy is so powerful... why doesn't he invade us?
to enter the realm of earth the emperor's demon sorcerer, shang tsung... and his warriors must win 10 straight victories in mortal kombat.

## a handful of people on a leaky boat are going to save the world?
exactly.

## what about the others?
they are all great fighters... but i have looked into their souls... and yours.

## oh, still concerned only with vengeance?
lf you challenge shang tsung now... you'il lose your life and your soul.

## ls anybody monitoring?
jaxx, this is sonya.

## do you copy?
while you're at it, call my agent.

## what are you doing?
the electrical disturbance blew out the transistors.

## do i look like your travel agent?
fine.

## what's going on?
i don't know.

## do you need help with those?
ah, no more steps.

## you know?
when a woman looks at you like that... it usually means something.

## where are you going?
after shang tsung.

## remember what rayden said?
he didn't say anything to me.

## how many times must i tell you?
i don't need your help.

## where are you going?
i'm following him.

## forget about him?
i want to get to the bottom of this.

## are you out of your mind?
sonya...

## what?
see, me...

## then he freezes this guy, right?
and then he explodes.

## what i want to know... if this shang tsung guy's so great... how come he's got such a crummy looking boat?
well, anyway, guy gives me the creeps.

## yeah?
i haven't seen any of them around.

## right?
i am goro! general of the armies of outworld and prince... of the subterranean realm of shokan.

## what's that, something like underground?
yes, something like... that.

## why else would i have chosen such a disreputable looking cretin?
look at him.

## now, when do i get paid?
after you've fought the girl.

## to what do we owe the honor of your visit, shang tsung?
to warn you kung lao's descendant is competing in the tournament.

## why should i worry about her?
princess kitana is 10, 000 years old... and the rightful heir to the throne of outworld.

## what's so special about you?
i don't know.

## what is it?
we are not alone.

## what happened?
there's something here.

## where is she?
i don't know.

## where are we going?
i know exactly where we're going.

## piece of cake, huh?
well, it was easy for me.

## what is it with you guys?
we're standing... they're not.

## what more do you want?
brilliant.

## so, why don't you show me what you plan to do about... them?
i don't think so.

## you mean goro?
and shang tsung.

## will he fight in the tournament?
lf he chooses to.

## did you miss me?
now look at this.

## you used it to knife your mother in the back?
it put a big smile on your partner, though.

## does it hurt, baby?
right.

## why do you care if i win?
to win your next match, use the element which brings life.

## water.
what?

## ls it time?
yes.

## how can we possibly beat something like that?
good question.

## so, who says we're afraid?
you must first face your fears... if you are to conquer them.

## what about me?
oh, you.

let's go.

## where's my daughter?
i spent the night watching a movie, you crazy...

## get a handle on this lady, will ya?
it's ok.

## anyone else have any questions for me?
then you'il have to find a few other arabs to harass.

## why would you want to cuff me?
yes.

## why take her on an airplane with no means of escape?
i don't know.

## how could two passengers pull that off?
they'd have to have somebody from the crew involved.

## what makes you so special?
i know the plane.

## for what?
i think they're hijacking the plane.

## what's he doing?
excuse me.

## are we done looking?

## just kiss me, okay?
okay.

## are you sure this isn't a sin?
i was pretty sure what we were doing wasn't a sin, but not sure enough to give dean what he really needed.

## i mean, sure, jesus could restore my physical and spiritual virginity, especially if i lost it to some rapist, but... who wants that?
i'm saving myself until marriage, and i'il use force if necessary.

## what's all that about restoring your virginity?
i mean, physically, you're a virgin once.

a lot of temptations over the summer.

## her actions are such a cry for help.
who wants to recommit themselves to the lord?

## she may not know this now, but she is like she's like that much closer to accepting jesus in her heart, right?
i think that's why god has missionaries like patrick to spread his word.

## you're mary, right?
here's your board.

## isn't she great?
she knows just how to compliment my vocal stylings without overpowering them.

## so, like, what part of the world has the worst heathens?

## how are you?

he doesn't appreciate one thing you do for him.

## without the strength and love that jesus provides me, do you really think cassandra's gonna be able to take care of him?
no way.

## what are you supposed to be?
a roller skate.

## you didn't just do this for the parking permit, did you?
pretty much.

## i mean, sure, they can't all be right, but they can 't all be wrong, right?
you know, the whole crystal thing is so felt up.

## don't you have a church to desecrate or something?
roland and i saw you sneaking out of the clinic.

## you got a second?
yeah.

## you mean like shoot her?

## who would have thought a zebra could have such a kick?
he's on the rail and moving fast.

## you so obsessed with winning you'il pick on a girl?

## you expect me to dignify that?
i'm just a kentucky gal who loves watching thoroughbreds race at the top of their game.

## mr. walsh?
well, there goes the great nolan walsh, everyone.

## what do you have to say about that?
mind your own business.

## which is what you are.

but i am a horse.

## a zebra?
i thought i was a racehorse.

## why didn't anyone tell me?
well, i just can't believe you deliberately disobeyed me.

## why not?
at least she would've tried to understand.

## what brings you out here?
i got a hunch about your zebra.

## twenty three seconds a quarter mile?
he didn't finish...... but i got him between the quarter pole and the half mile pole.

## and even if i could, i mean...... you got the $5000 entrance fee?
we miss you down at the track.

## is he always like this?
worse.

## yeah?
why don't you come on out here.

## what?
dad.

## what do you think the alternative is?
i don't ride him.

## franny?
hey.

## how did you know?
if you build it, they will come.

## why bother?
i don't understand this.

## isn't this what he wanted?
this is exactly why i never had kids.

## yes?
get off my back.

## run into any trees lately?
oh, great.

## what's going on with you?
that doesn't sound like the attitude of a racehorse.

## zebra?
i know.

## why didn't you say anything?
because i don't care that you're not a racehorse.

## hey, what's your problem?
i'm not a racehorse.

## anyone with a fire in their heart.
what?

## what do you know, you little nobody?
you never raced.

## what's he ever done?
let me tell you something.

## and that's it?
no.

## and who else?
tucker.

## how come he never said anything?
because to him...... actions speak louder than words.

## so what?
you're a horse with stripes who needs an attitude adjustment.

## tucker, you don't really think i have what it takes, do you?
now listen to me, kid.

## you just keep running, okay?
and let the chief worry about the gate.

## now what?
now you give it all you got.

## well, tomorrow's the big day, kid.
oh, god, what is that?

## do you think i'm ready?

## you get my point?
i'il do my best, dad.

## how did you get in here?
say your prayers, pelican.

## can i get a little help here?
tucker, get sandy.

## what?
i don't want to be a racehorse.

## what are we gonna do?
we're gonna keep looking.

## what are you talking about?
he looks okay to me.

## what were we talking about?
i hate my life.

## you forgive your old man?
daddy, you're not old.

## can a zebra...?
sentimental favorite, stripes...... can beat trenton's pride.

## beautiful day, huh?
it would be if you weren't working so hard to ruin my race day...... with that glorified donkey of yours.

## you wanna make this more interesting?
i'm just asking.

## would you shut up?
tucker says to hug the rail and make your move at the turn.

## stripes seems to be running out of steam.
how does the rail taste?

## had enough, boy?
trenton's pride is going strongly up there amongst the leading line.

## hey, stripey.

## you know what?
i will bet you anything it's genetic.

## would you deal with this for me?

## what if we dig the pool and carol anne sleepwalks...... and she falls into it before there's any water?
honey, no.

## what's three meters?
it's about ten feet.

## when you dive off, it's like free falling, okay?
you got to get your position now.

## honey?
three meters.

## is everything okay?
it's thundering.

## it knows i live here, doesn't it?
it knows everything about us.

## how do you know?
cause i can count.

## you know what you do?
when you see the lightning...... you count till you hear the thunder.

## want to try it?
okay.

## happy dreams, okay?
good night, daddy.

## how is it?
great, mrs. freeling.

## did you do this?
you guys.

## do you?
i tell you, i think you'il really enjoy this kitchen.

## where do you live, mr. freeling?
well, we were the first family to set up housekeeping in cuesta verde estates.

## you know something?
i think you're right.

## what about the cans?
leave this here.

## okay?
listen, i kept dana and robbie out of this...... but carol anne was here so she knows.

## now just stand... okay?
now, just be calm.

## remember that?
okay.

## okay?
yeah, okay.

## we'il go to pizza hut, okay?
okay, now....

## a mosquito ever suck on you, son?
i don't know, dad.

## what kind of disturbances?
you know...... dishes or furniture moving around by themselves.

## who, for instance?
i looked in the yellow pages.

## would you like a glass for that?
no, thank you.

## if i got killed, would i come back as a ghost and get stuck in the house...... like my sister?
your sister isn't dead, robbie.

## if i got killed, could i visit her and show her how to get back here?
you could tie a rope around me and hold it, then somebody could come...... and get us and we'd go live somewhere else.

## but how come grandpa isn't on television with carol anne?
some people believe that when people die...... there's a wonderful light...... as bright as the sun.

## do you think they're still alive?
yes.

## so, some people get angry and throw things around, like in my bedroom?
yes.

## listen, partner, maybe we ought to get some shut eye, okay?
okay.

## can i take e. buzz with me when we go?
sure you can.

## look at all of them.
what is it?

## who are all those people?
they're so lonely.

## where are they coming from?
i don't know.

## call me, okay?
this cameo is over 100 years old.

## aren't you feeling any better?
i'm still weak.

## the rest of the block dark, too?
no, it's just us.

## you afraid of burglars or you trying to attract every insect in cuesta verde?
steve, tell me something.

## are you happy here?
yes, i am.

## feel like going for a little ride?
i'd like to show you something.

## one of your children was born in your house?
carol anne.

## she caught the flu as well?
yeah, we've all got the same thing.

## are you leaving cuesta verde?
it's hard to believe the day could be this beautiful.

## how's that spot for a bay window?
you don't have to live in the valley anymore.

## what are you saying?
we're starting phase 5 right here where we're standing.

## interested?
mr. teague, that's a generous offer.

## not much room for a pool, is there?
we own all the land.

## that's sacrilegious, isn't it?
don't worry about it.

## when?
in 1976.

## cuesta verde?
all 300 acres.

## what's worrying you?
friends and relatives can visit their loved ones in broxton memorial park.

## okay with whom?
whomever might complain.

## would y'all mind hanging back?
you're jamming my frequencies.

## is this your knott's berry farm solution?
i know what you're thinking.

## this house has many hearts.
why is this door locked, mr. freeling?

## what's the matter?
i was trying to answer her with my mind and she couldn't hear me.

## didn't you say tangina barrons was an extraordinary clairvoyant?
i am.

## and will you do anything i ask...... even if it comes contrary to your beliefs as a human being and a christian?
yes, i promise.

## would you all come on in?
gather round.

## do you understand me?
these souls, who, for whatever reason...... are not at rest...... are also not aware that they have passed on.

## bath water?
i shut it off.

## can you hear me?
carol anne, please tell mommy hello.

## can you say hello to daddy?
daddy and i miss you so much.

## who's restraining her?
it's daddy.

## she's away from him.
carol anne?

## is she all right?
diane, ask about the light.

## are you in the light?
no.

## i'm going to dinner with janice and brian.

you may give him this.

## musketeers?
so much for civility.

## but who would believe the musketeers capable?
cardinal richelieu.

## detained where?
in the cardinal's jail.

## what of the king?
these are his musketeers.

## so, let me see, how can i phrase this?
without killing anyone, make the king a fool in buckingham's eyes.

## what if i absolutely must kill someone?
well, if you must, you must.

## is he always like that?
no.

## why do you stay?
he is all the family i have.

## do you wish to see the room or not?
that stair moved at the last moment.

## a name?
yes, of course.

## are you certain?
not if you don't like it.

## what happened?
they kept getting killed.

## this is the best room?
well, actually, it's the only room.

## does every man tell you you're beautiful?
yes.

## did the ceiling move?
i need a place for my horses and coach.

## do you know the jail so well from the time you spent there?
this is not the first time a musketeer needed rescuing.

## something amuses you?
this coach, for one.

a cardinal's guard.

that you trust me.

## what are you doing here?
freeing treville.

yes.

## who was it?
someone delivering wine... from the cardinal.

## well, we wanted to see how good you are.
a gift from the cardinal?

## and?
you're quite good.

## the keys.
revile?

## which key?
guess.

## is this any better than prison?
well, the food will be.

## and if they come to take you again?
then i shall go and see the king in person... and not rot in the cardinal's jail.

## porthos, who is this pretty young thing?
he's a bit tender for you, josephine.

## is that not right, aramis?
perhaps later.

## you both know her?
yes.

## you fight amongst yourselves?
oh, a man has to fight with someone.

## doesn't he know we don't exist?
we're going to work for the cardinal.

## you see how well they take the suspension?
everybody's a bit preoccupied with, uh, not being occupied.

## the englishman?
buckingham.

## how about the would be musketeer?
go and win our meals and wine.

## oh, i'm certain you don't.
have you got dung in your ears?

## i would not fight a drunken musketeer... so i'm unfit to drink with?
athos was... testing you.

## testing me?
yes.

## you've seen many ugly naked women?
that's not what i meant.

## are you standing up?
you can turn around now.

## are there, uh, any on my back?
a few.

## and you feel no need to be when insects are involved?
my mother came from spain with the queen.

## but it will not always be so, will it, d'artagnan?
that must be fascinating work.

## is that true, bonacieux?
if bonacieux went that way, we should be going this way.

## you consider this the test of a man?
uh, more bread.

## does he mean you or me?
i thought i was the baker.

## you think that came from a croissant?
oh.

## is it a long sword or a short sword?
well, long enough.

## do you keep your sword polished?
uh, when there's time.

## and do you do it yourself or do you have help?
mm, myself.

## what now?
add the salt.

## what do i use for ducks?
like your respect and power, they have been overrun.

## who are you?
i will stay.

## your royal highness, would you rather go back out there?
hello.

## will you keep leaping out at me?
i wanted to warn you.

## why did you tell me?
perhaps because you said i was beautiful.

## you want to get us all slaughtered?
yes, i warned him.

## is that what you want?
no.

## do you understand me?
i am your humble servant, d'artagnan.

## what do you want?
i even want to know your philosophical and political leanings.

## is that why you wish to see me, to pass along advice?
fires are erupting all over france.

## and how did you deal with the ones who were not peasants?
you confuse me.

## do you know why france has come to this?
the king, poor man, is weak.

## how is it you have their trust?
i helped them free revile.

## and, of course, why give the musketeers a martyr?
of course.

## will it be soon?
yes.

## where?
we escort the queen.

## won't the king's guards escort her?
no, the king does not know.

## are you bragging?
i will wait outside.

## what do you call that card you are hiding in your sleeve?
the ace of spades.

## cannot go?
there's something that i must do.

## what is so important that you cannot help a musketeer?
as you so frequently remind me, i'm not a musketeer.

## i know you, don't i?
i very much doubt it.

## would you fight a man over nothing?
enthusiastically.

## you hear the most interesting things about yourself... when people think you're asleep, hmm?
this is francesca bonacieux, an old friend.

## perhaps a little to eat... and then on your way?
i have no intention of leaving you.

## what's not good?
the lead horse lost a shoe.

## how can we go?
i'il be back in a moment.

## are you now like your father?
you ask a lot of questions.

## are you like your father?
i'm still trying.

## like what?
those eyes.

## would you care to say that again?
this is not after, this is between.

## who are you?
no.

## hmm?
oh, how touching.

## just one?
i'm insulted.

## for whom do you do this?
for my own pleasure.

## richelieu?
no, he wouldn't go that far.

## did you kill the spanish envoy?
i would die before i help you.

## why are you doing this?
no, you said... that you liked children.

## is there no mercy in your heart?
no mercy.

## what happened?
he came back.

## and did you kill him?
well, he doesn't seem to have killed you.

## so what choice does that leave us?
he escaped, sir.

## perhaps a little boy?
i know.

## the queen?
and francesca.

## who did this?
a man in black.

## you're a friend of the queen's?
yes.

## you brought her here?
yes.

## where?
duchamps castle.

## and a young woman?
he took her too.

## what will you do?
get an army of my own.

## you see?
come on, strega.

## why?
i know his name.

## what's the importance to you?
oh, my god.

## who s gone too far?
i'm here to tell you, you shall have your wish.

## damn me to hell?
well, i'm certain that's where i'm going.

## sorry you had to come all that way for this.
is that what he needs?

## lord buckingham?
from the queen.

## where's revile?
we carried what was left of him out a few minutes ago.

## what happened here?
someone said they saw a man.

## febre?
well, it's the sort of thing that appeals to him.

## does it matter to you... that three men died?
well, we managed to free the others without you, d'artagnan.

## is this your answer?
i've been practicing.

## are you afraid of febre?
we've come to this.

## if not our fight, whose fight is it?
they're king's musketeers, not the queen's.

## and where were your allegiances when we asked for your help?
i had to escort the queen.

## uh, i didn't teach you to use such a good armagnac.
escort the queen?

## where are we going?
probably to die.

## can you get strega?
he's on the southern road, two kilometers out.

## what are you doing?
i heard talk.

## am i truly crazy?
let me answer that.

## you've changed your mind?
no, i've come to change yours.

## what scheme is that?
i shall ride with you.

## where's the queen?
i don't know.

## now, will you please go kill him?

## do you think it's worth anything?
i'd be very much surprised.

## what is wrong?
queen kida.

## where is the patrol captain?
i want them met with fliers.

## audrey, what are you guys doing here?
just making sure you aren't making a mess of things down here.

## so, who wants to show me around the city?
oh, let me.

## why don't you ask him yourself?
milo.

## the leviathan?
right.

## what is this?
that's a life preserver.

## so you wear it and it preserves your life, like our crystals?
no, no.

## oh, so it is a game?
no.

## does that not make it hard for them to play the game?
two weeks we crisscross the north sea and get nothing.

## what if raising the crystal brought this leviathan to life?
this could all be the fault of atlantis.

## where's milo and kida?
i didn't see them launch.

## kida?
come on, come on.

## uh, where's the kraken?
it has disappeared.

## what's the matter, vinny, afraid to play patty cake with the sea monster, ooh?
no.

## i guess fishing hasn't been too good lately, huh?
that is not surprising.

## then why is it still here?
because it doesn't eat fish any more.

## ew, what is that smell?
it's like rotting fish.

## why do you accuse such a thing?
i have bathed.

## what is your business here?
nice to meet you.

## and what about your town pet that nearly sank our ship?
your ship will be repaired at the shipyards of tronheim.

## wasn't volgud that statue guy?
that would make him even older than he looks... which i gotta say is pretty darn old.

## thank you, miss allyson?
inger.

## or the sea monster's?
i will prepare rooms for you.

## what is it?
it is not of this earth.

## where's volgud?
his light is gone.

## and which way would that be?
oh, over there.

## you think we've got fleas?
gee.

## the kraken?
sometimes known as the\\"devil fish.

## maybe a hidden cave?
i could search.

## table scraps and a rolled up newspaper?
he's not using table scraps.

## i'il distract him.
where's audrey?

## what?
but he's unconscious.

## how about picking the target before i light the dynamite, huh?
get to the sub pods.

## audrey, you doing all right?
yeah.

## what are you doing?
we want to sneak up on...

## what are you waiting for?
fire the...

## so if something stinks now, uh...
are you crazy?

## why you do this with your hand?
it is the fish.

## hey, where's kida?
it's even more beautiful when the snow melts.

## uh, not looking at the scenery, huh?
maybe the crystal's too powerful.

## what are the chances of another gas leak in a chinese laundry?
so that's my last flower shop.

## may i have your attention, please?
hmm, that's better.

## and you say he mentioned killer coyotes in a sandstorm?
mm, no, not exactly.

## and this is unusual in your world?
oh, yes.

## uh, where did you find this?
you'il have to ask sam.

## now, uh, how about a sip of water?
got a little sleepy in the foot.

## and you say coyotes did this to you?
no.

## mr mckeane, what have we told you about the bacon grease?
works better than any of your darn fool fix 'em ups.

## is he going to be all right?
oh, yes.

## so where did you find this?
in a pot.

## what pot?
in the crate.

## what crate?
in my shack.

## what shack?
hmm.

## you saw the man eat, right?
lives like he eats... sloppy.

## maid's day off, huh?
quartz, uh, silicate, mixed with local clay.

## from the sand?
mckeane said they were sand coyotes.

## oh, look, an antique.
missin '?

## how are people to use these things if they're locked behind glass?
it's for protection.

## but why is it in a glass case?
no, the glass case is for protection.

## wouldn't the spear be better protection than a glass case?
yes...

## why would someone want to steal a glass case?
calcified limestone more than 25 million years old... from the cenozoic era.

## how much is it?
well, that's a museum class piece.

## is this enough?
kida, that that's a lot...

## so, mr carnaby, where exactly do you get all of your artefacts?
well, uh, here and there.

## who are you people?
we're associates of sam mckeane, and he's asked us to help locate the missing crate.

## so you don't know anything about it?
if mckeane lost a crate of pottery, that's not my problem.

## what in the red rock river valley are you doin '?
sampling the bowl.

## would you like some?
well, that could have gone better.

## does it strike anybody as odd that carnaby knows the missing crate contains pottery?
because i never mentioned what was in it.

## perhaps they are brothers?
twice is a coincidence.

## but three times?
i think someone's trying to tell us something.

## can we offer you a ride?
it's a long walk to anywhere.

## you wouldn't happen to have a twin or two, would you?
there are many noshoni men who walk alone in the desert.

## where did that come from?
every word.

## how do you know that the missing crate contains pottery?
uh, i don't.

## and what do you know about an old man who calls himself chakashi?
i know i got a shelf full of painted rocks of him inside.

## we gave a ride to a spirit?
you can't really believe in that superstition.

## well, so what?
mckeane found it in the desert... and then while he was in the hospital, i found it in his shack.

## carnaby, that old pot can fit on any of those ledges.
a hole?

## what is that?
sorry.

## naturally, i can't let you go free to tell the world about my discovery.
that home made prairie grass mixture makes a good sleeping gas... wouldn't you agree?

## nice nap?
hope the rocks weren't too uncomfortable.

## didn't i say so?
i said,\\"i don't trust that carnaby.

## uh, what is this?
retribution.

## what happened to carnaby?
he is with us now.

## what is this secret?
prove to me that it is as great as what you see around you.

## do i own anything that's ordinary?
regardless, i do have a good idea who took it.

## what is ragnarok?
doomsday in the old norse myths.

## but why did mr hellstrom want the spear?

## do you believe me?
maybe i do.

## everything's real quiet out there, isn't it?

## don't you wanna see them?
i'il see them soon enough.

## you sure no one would know?
squeezing that watch won't stop time.

## can't you see we need you?
there's one of your outfit, dan.

## about 2:40?

## where are you?
here.

## dan, where are you?
alice.

## did you hear that thunder?
lf you're doing this for me...

## why don't you wave to him?
to do you a favour.

## how do i know you'il jump?
i don't like owing any favours.

## we all start off in life with a dream, don't we?
for a tennis player, it's being in the final of the grand slam... center court, a high lob, a smash.

## you see that good looking fella?
no, not the kid in white.

## how long can peter colt keep playing this game?
time to retire gracefully.

## these young guys... where do they get the energy, the focus?
no fear.

## what happens then?
i hope you don't mind, but i took the liberty of having it engraved.

## is this the young man you were telling us about?
mm hmm.

## won't we, ladies?
oh, do shut up, sylvia.

## what makes one tennis player different from another?
it isn't a killer forehand or serve.

## anybody home?
hello, carl.

## life still giving you trouble, is it?
deep throat.\\"director's cut.

## you all right, dad?
yes, yes, yes.

## you got our wimbledon tickets sorted yet?

## we're not invited?
no.

## what won't i like?

## and do you know why?
because i believe you to be a truly great tennis player.

## losing?
yeah, losing.

## tickets?
oh, god.

## you really are a wanker, aren't you?
harsh but fair.

## dad, what are you doing up there?
i should've moved up here years ago.

## remember i always told you that tennis was a gentleman's game?
yeah.

## you need something?
yeah, i...

## what makes perfect sense?
you see, i'd reserved a more modest room.

## see now?
that's much cozier.

## i mean, i just want to focus on my game, you know?
unfortunately...

## gonna knock 'em dead this year, peter?
that's the idea, danny.

## gonna knock 'em dead this year, ivan?
i'il do my best for you.

## you wanna go for dinner?
afraid not.

## oh, really?
intriguing irish girl.

## she have a sister?

oh, just one more serve, daddy.

## two seconds, okay?
it's funny.

## what are you talking about?
3:00.

## you ever heard of him?
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

## shouldn't he be off discovering masturbation or something?
played him at bogota.

## and you taught him that lesson in bogota?
sadly, no.

## isn't he playing your brother?
you should be ashamed of yourself.

## what?
not interested.

## what wimbledon is this for you, peter?
it's my 13th actually.

## we can avoid all of this, all right?
yeah, you're probably right.

## how's your injury?
you have one new message.

## uh, say, 7:00?
room 1221.

## what?
let me just...

## are you hungry?
um, not quite.

## where do you come down on the whole\\"fooling around before a match\\"issue?
well, that's a very intriguing question.

## yes, it is, isn't it?
it is... very sad.

## are you?
i'm interested.

## really?
i had been planning a brief press statement.

## okay?
absolutely fine with me.

## peter?
bugger.

## last match of your career, and you got three games?
time.

## who would have thought, 40 minutes ago, that we'd be in a fifth set?
30 love.

## peter, did you know that dragomir is the first seeded player you've defeated in three years?
yes.

## but who's really counting?
what, uh...

## what do you think of your next opponent?
truthfully, in all the excitement, i haven't even checked to see who it is.

## is your elbow playing up?
well, if i admit to that, you may use it to your advantage.

## dodgy shoulder maybe?
the truth is, most everything aches.

## mr. bradbury, hello.
hello?

## mr. bradbury?
damn.

## yeah?
yeah.

## come stai?
you are the dragomir slayer.

## how are you?
you look a million... lira.

## do you know my partner, sophia?
no.

## so?
i'm looking for lizzie bradbury.

## have you seen her?
no.

## why do you think?
oh, right.

## looking for someone?
yeah.

## wouldn't happen to be my daughter?
yes, it would.

## it's colt, right?
yes, but please call me peter.

## do you see me as a distraction?
that's exactly how i see you.

## is that clear?
i suppose, in a few thousand years, the english will evolve webbed feet.

## oh, you know what?
i think i'il...

## see?
now that was quite funny.

## i don't wanna win too easily, what with you and that, what is it, bad knee?
i have a little confession to make.

## you did?
mm hmm.

## you were ahead, but then you totally fell apart, remember?
yes.

## to lose like that when you were playing so beautifully?
i couldn't get it out of my head.

## like a knight in shining armor perhaps?
no.

## what?
perhaps my first serve's getting a little mushy.

## hardly anything, is it?
barely moving.

## did you wish on your next match?
it wouldn't work if i told you.

## who do you play?
good friend of mine actually.

## a friend?
then you should know how to beat him.

## what are his weaknesses?
um, sausages, wagner, men in leather shorts.

## now i have to kill him?
without thinking twice.

## why's that?
you practice together, you travel together, you practically live together.

## do you really have what it takes to close out a friend in the third round of wimbledon?
because that is killing him.

## wh where the hell are the men's matches?
man, roddick lost tojake hammond in four sets, mate.

## didn't hear?
you know, that bastard usually comes through for me.

## are you, uh, peter colt's brother?
possibly.

## really?
absolutely.

## well, aren't i popular?
peter.

## peter, remember me?
it's your mother.

## what did i always say about ya?
i don't know.

## so, uh, cucumber and cucumber?
and cucumber.

## what am i talking about?
okay, well, i called you about a year ago, and i'm still waiting for you to return my call.

## ron?
that's a lie.

## you want me to be completely honest with you?
agents are not miracle workers.

## you know what, ron?
i genuinely despise you.

## and you know what, peter?
i really don't take it personally.

## you got a problem with that?
you'd have to cut your commission.

## tea?
yes.

## how they hangin '?
fine.

## and yours?
fine.

## you haven't met yet?
hi.

## the\\"peter peter colt?
the one and only.

## oh, really?
nothing good, i hope.

## are you all right?
you look beautiful.

## did i do that?
i'm sorry.

## lizzie, what's the deal?
i've left you, like, half a dozen messages.

## how about that?
hi.

## do you know peter colt?
yeah, we did meet once.

## did you hear?
wait a second.

## you are, aren't you?
i don't believe this.

## what are you, grandpa, ranked, like, 120?
i thought all those things they said about you were just rumors, but you really are a cheap little...

## are you all right, sir?
i'm fine.

## yeah.
lizzie?

## but what about your dad?
aw, let him find his own place.

## what went wrong?
she couldn't sing.

## i mean, that's why we love the tour, isn't it?
there's always another country, another airport.

## you said\\"leslie.\\"who's leslie?
as you can see, we've, uh, we've had to fire the builders due to creative differences.

## piccy?
just a bitty.

## carl, what are you doing?
uh, pete.

## can i take a picture?
no, you bloody can't.

## who are you?
oh, i only got four pizzas.

## everything all right?
everything's great.

## aren't we gonna have a workout?
i thought we just had one.

## now, are you sure about this?
i usually do 10 miles.

## why are you running behind me?
there's something i haven't told you.

## what?
this is my last tournament, no matter what happens.

## will he maintain his gentlemanly composure, or will he... dare i say... win the point?
hold on.

## what's happened to the ball?
look.

## so, still bettin 'against your brother, are ya?
it's tactical.

## where the heck did you get a hundred quid anyway?
photojournalism.

## where's my daughter?
she...

## are you bullshitting me?
absolutely not.

## so, how was your trip down?
the traffic can be murder getting out of london.

## uh, wou would you like a cup of, uh, tea?
maybe something stronger.

## it's peter, right?
yeah.

## but you're not, are you?
as a matter of fact, i was incredibly easy.

## but why?
she's hardly lost a set.

## and what do you think that is?
what we've been working towards all these years, what she's always wanted more than anything.

## you're gonna go?
yeah.

## we can be together after the tournament.
lizzie?

## what does that mean?
you can't just switch me on and off like a bloody lightbulb.

## what?
i'm sorry, kid, but...

## think you can go on?
not so fast, chrissy.

## the question is, will colt be able to take advantage of tom cavendish?
he's never shown much of a killer instinct.

## can we take another route?
her match is at 3:00.

## what's the score, sweetheart?
it's match point.

## what?
i've just destroyed their best hopes of winning a championship.

## what do you think makes her so extraordinary?
no embarrassment, no fear.

## me?
i hate making a decision.

## where's the girl camped out, ron?
32 kensington place.

## you want that on you conscience?
thank you.

## lizzie?
lizzie, it's me.

## what are you doing here?
that's an excellent question.

## you have?
but i need you to go.

## is that what we're doing here?
good thing you didn't get the wrong room.

## mr. colt, are you okay?
it's my back.

## can you get up?
i'm not entirely sure.

## i'd love to see an english guy in the finals, but give me a break.
how does he deal with it?

## your shoulder was killing you, and what did you do then?
all right.

## can we just do a quickie?
no, not right now.

## how'd she do?
it's just one of those days where i couldn't do anything wrong, and lizzie just couldn't do anything right.

## it's not as if she can blame you, is it?
i told you i needed to focus, to be away from you for just a few days.

## that's why you think i'm here?
it's not.

## you see?
i know you want me to think... that we're falling in love or some bullshit, but the only thing you fell in love with this week was winning.

## and you know what?
i love winning too.

## shouldn't you be off sucking up tojake?
i took care of that at breakfast.

## frito lay.
feel that?

## what?
you are the new spokesperson for their brand new chip.

## i would kill for another dozen of those... what do you call the... those little cucumber sandwiches?

oh, eggs will be fine.

## where's the marmalade?
well, uh, i'm out of the tree house.

## what's that?
you, peter.

## hmm?
my back.

## well, it's been quite a fortnight, hasn't it?
yes, i'm sorry.

## who would have thought?
i didn't think he was gonna do it.

## ready, sir?
yeah, i think i am.

## what do you attribute this remarkable run to?
you were supposed to make a very early exit.

## love of the game?
yeah, love of the game.

## by the way, how's the weak back?
it's fine.

## how's the weak mind?
gentlemen.

## what are you doing, lad?
get in here.

## having a tough day?
well, you know, disastrous.

## why are you british apologizing all the time?
don't apologize to me.

## what'd you say?
i said that the whole country has been waiting...

## and who might that be?
that might be a winner.

## did he flee the building with the rain?
i think he's in the lavatory.

## is it?
yes.

## what?
his serve.

## which one of my kids do i love more?
my daughter.

## you all right?
yeah.

## john, did you see who just came in?
that'il give an immediate adrenaline burst.

## or is it the toss?
yes.

## did you see that?
look at the chalk fly.

## the question is, can he do it?
after a call like that... a lot of players, including yours truly, would have a hard time getting back in the mind set.

## that dream finally come true.
what's wrong with you?

## what else could ever come close?
for a tennis player, it's being in the final of the grand slam... center court, a high lob, a smash.

## you see that good looking fella?
no, not the kid in white.

## how long can peter colt keep playing this game?
time to retire gracefully.

## these young guys... where do they get the energy, the focus?
no fear.

## what happens then?
i hope you don't mind, but i took the liberty of having it engraved.

## is this the young man you were telling us about?
mm hmm.

## won't we, ladies?
oh, do shut up, sylvia.

## what makes one tennis player different from another?
it isn't a killer forehand or serve.

## anybody home?
deep throat.\\"director's cut.

## you all right, dad?
yes, yes, yes.

## you got our wimbledon tickets sorted yet?
cause, you know, i don't wanna miss your grand finale.

## we're not invited?
no.

## what won't i like?
hello, darling.

## why is dad so upset?
oh.

## and do you know why?
because i believe you to be a truly great tennis player.

## losing?
yeah, losing.

## tickets?
oh, god.

## you really are a wanker, aren't you?
harsh but fair.

## dad, what are you doing up there?
i should've moved up here years ago.

## remember i always told you that tennis was a gentleman's game?
yeah.

## you need something?
yeah, i...

## what makes perfect sense?
you see, i'd reserved a more modest room.

## see now?
that's much cozier.

## i mean, i just want to focus on my game, you know?
unfortunately...

## gonna knock 'em dead this year, peter?
that's the idea, danny.

## gonna knock 'em dead this year, ivan?
i'il do my best for you.

## you wanna go for dinner?
afraid not.

## oh, really?
intriguing irish girl.

## she have a sister?
only child.

## forgotten me already?
god, no.

## and you're?
peter.

## lizzie, sweetheart, what the heck are you doing?
oh, just one more serve, daddy.

## two seconds, okay?
it's funny.

## what are you talking about?
3:00.

## you ever heard of him?
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

## shouldn't he be off discovering masturbation or something?
played him at bogota.

## and you taught him that lesson in bogota?
sadly, no.

## isn't he playing your brother?
you should be ashamed of yourself.

## what?
not interested.

## what wimbledon is this for you, peter?
it's my 13th actually.

## we can avoid all of this, all right?
yeah, you're probably right.

## you still owe me fish and chips.
how's your injury?

## uh, say, 7:00?
let me just...

## are you hungry?
um, not quite.

## where do you come down on the whole\\"fooling around before a match\\"issue?
well, that's a very intriguing question.

## yes, it is, isn't it?
it is... very sad.

## are you?
i'm interested.

## really?
i had been planning a brief press statement.

## okay?
absolutely fine with me.

## peter?
bugger.

## last match of your career, and you got three games?
time.

## who would have thought, 40 minutes ago, that we'd be in a fifth set?
30 love.

## peter, did you know that dragomir is the first seeded player you've defeated in three years?
yes.

## but who's really counting?
what, uh...

## what do you think of your next opponent?
truthfully, in all the excitement, i haven't even checked to see who it is.

## is your elbow playing up?
well, if i admit to that, you may use it to your advantage.

## dodgy shoulder maybe?
the truth is, most everything aches.

## mr. bradbury, hello.
hello?

## mr. bradbury?
damn.

## yeah?
yeah.

## come stai?
you are the dragomir slayer.

## how are you?
you look a million... lira.

## do you know my partner, sophia?
no.

## so?
i'm looking for lizzie bradbury.

## have you seen her?
no.

## why do you think?
oh, right.

## looking for someone?
yeah.

## wouldn't happen to be my daughter?
yes, it would.

## it's colt, right?
yes, but please call me peter.

## do you see me as a distraction?
that's exactly how i see you.

## is that clear?
i suppose, in a few thousand years, the english will evolve webbed feet.

## oh, you know what?
i think i'il...

## see?
now that was quite funny.

## i don't wanna win too easily, what with you and that, what is it, bad knee?
i have a little confession to make.

## you did?
mm hmm.

## you were ahead, but then you totally fell apart, remember?
yes.

## to lose like that when you were playing so beautifully?
i couldn't get it out of my head.

## like a knight in shining armor perhaps?
no.

## what?
perhaps my first serve's getting a little mushy.

## hardly anything, is it?
barely moving.

## did you wish on your next match?
it wouldn't work if i told you.

## who do you play?
good friend of mine actually.

## a friend?
then you should know how to beat him.

## what are his weaknesses?
um, sausages, wagner, men in leather shorts.

## now i have to kill him?
without thinking twice.

## why's that?
you practice together, you travel together, you practically live together.

## do you really have what it takes to close out a friend in the third round of wimbledon?
because that is killing him.

## wh where the hell are the men's matches?
man, roddick lost tojake hammond in four sets, mate.

## didn't hear?
you know, that bastard usually comes through for me.

## are you, uh, peter colt's brother?
possibly.

## really?
absolutely.

## well, aren't i popular?
peter. lan frazier from the club.

## peter, remember me?
it's your mother.

## what did i always say about ya?
i don't know.

## so, uh, cucumber and cucumber?
and cucumber.

## what am i talking about?
okay, well, i called you about a year ago, and i'm still waiting for you to return my call.

## ron?
that's a lie.

## you want me to be completely honest with you?
agents are not miracle workers.

## you know what, ron?
i genuinely despise you.

## and you know what, peter?
i really don't take it personally.

## you got a problem with that?
you'd have to cut your commission.

## tea?
yes.

## how they hangin '?
fine.

## and yours?
fine.

## you haven't met yet?
hi.

## the\\"peter peter colt?
the one and only.

## oh, really?
you look beautiful.

## did i do that?
i'm sorry.

## lizzie, what's the deal?
i've left you, like, half a dozen messages.

## how about that?
hi.

## do you know peter colt?
yeah, we did meet once.

## did you hear?
wait a second.

## you are, aren't you?
i don't believe this.

## what are you, grandpa, ranked, like, 120?
i thought all those things they said about you were just rumors, but you really are a cheap little...

## are you all right, sir?
i'm fine.

## yeah.
lizzie?

## but what about your dad?
aw, let him find his own place.

## what went wrong?
she couldn't sing.

## i mean, that's why we love the tour, isn't it?
there's always another country, another airport.

## who's leslie?
as you can see, we've, uh, we've had to fire the builders due to creative differences.

## piccy?
just a bitty.

## carl, what are you doing?
uh, pete.

## can i take a picture?
no, you bloody can't.

## who are you?
oh, i only got four pizzas.

## everything all right?
everything's great.

## aren't we gonna have a workout?
i thought we just had one.

## now, are you sure about this?
i usually do 10 miles.

## why are you running behind me?
there's something i haven't told you.

## what?
this is my last tournament, no matter what happens.

## will he maintain his gentlemanly composure, or will he... dare i say... win the point?
hold on.

## what's happened to the ball?
look.

## so, still bettin 'against your brother, are ya?
it's tactical.

## where the heck did you get a hundred quid anyway?
photojournalism.

## where's my daughter?
she...

## are you bullshitting me?
absolutely not.

## so, how was your trip down?
the traffic can be murder getting out of london.

## uh, wou would you like a cup of, uh, tea?
maybe something stronger.

## it's peter, right?
yeah.

## but you're not, are you?
as a matter of fact, i was incredibly easy.

## but why?
she's hardly lost a set.

## and what do you think that is?
what we've been working towards all these years, what she's always wanted more than anything.

## you're gonna go?
yeah.

## we can be together after the tournament.
lizzie?

## what does that mean?
you can't just switch me on and off like a bloody lightbulb.

## what?
i'm sorry, kid, but...

## think you can go on?
not so fast, chrissy.

## the question is, will colt be able to take advantage of tom cavendish?
he's never shown much of a killer instinct.

## can we take another route?
her match is at 3:00.

## what's the score, sweetheart?
it's match point.

## what?
i've just destroyed their best hopes of winning a championship.

## what do you think makes her so extraordinary?
no embarrassment, no fear.

## me?
i hate making a decision.

## where's the girl camped out, ron?
32 kensington place.

## you want that on you conscience?
thank you.

## lizzie?
lizzie, it's me.

## what are you doing here?
that's an excellent question.

## you have?
but i need you to go.

## is that what we're doing here?
good thing you didn't get the wrong room.

## mr. colt, are you okay?
it's my back.

## can you get up?
i'm not entirely sure.

## i'd love to see an english guy in the finals, but give me a break.
how does he deal with it?

## your shoulder was killing you, and what did you do then?
all right.

## can we just do a quickie?
no, not right now.

## how'd she do?
it's just one of those days where i couldn't do anything wrong, and lizzie just couldn't do anything right.

## it's not as if she can blame you, is it?
i told you i needed to focus, to be away from you for just a few days.

## that's why you think i'm here?
it's not.

## you see?
i know you want me to think... that we're falling in love or some bullshit, but the only thing you fell in love with this week was winning.

## and you know what?
i love winning too.

## shouldn't you be off sucking up tojake?
i took care of that at breakfast.

## frito lay.
feel that?

## what?
you are the new spokesperson for their brand new chip.

## i would kill for another dozen of those... what do you call the... those little cucumber sandwiches?
cucumber sandwiches.

## for god's sake, what...
you brits got a name for everything, huh?

## didn't i tell you always to knock before entering a room?
well, it's a bit late now.

## eggs and soldiers?
oh, eggs will be fine.

## where's the marmalade?

## what does it do?
well, it sees through rock strata and... it can find water up to a hundred feet deep.

## is this what you're looking for?
give it to her.

## why, exactly?
the truck's taking emergency fuel up to the zone... and we pick up the prospectors en route.

## how long will it take?
about sixteen hours if we go straight through.

## is there a problem?

## why?
we've got supplies.

## magda, what have you got in here?
shop said i was a fool, thought i'd never use it.

## are you gonna wear that?

ants.

## what is it?
i don't know for sure, but... it looks like some kind of nursery.

## for what?
the queen.

## what?
that creature.

## but why?
survival.

## ants?
that's impossible.

## why?
they've been here since before the dinosaurs.

## you?
i'il get you for this, karl.

## what?
not bad for a city boy.

## are you okay?
well... they've isolated that place so well... there's nothing that can get through.

it took my head, man.

## i read it in rosenzweig book, it was a big part of this theory.
how do you know that, jerry?

## when you found the watch, yeah.
what if whoever designed this stinking thing somehow managed to create a place where parallel realities can crossover like that?

## and we realized that somebody else had been marking numbers in the rooms, right?

## there's got to be a logical explanation.
yes!

## this is just an optical illusion or something?
yeah, sure.

## why not?
finally, yeah.

## if max is right, why don't you go and open that door?
oh, come on.

move it.

## what if he wakes up?
still out like a light.

## what's that supposed to mean?
only that someone in this car is ashamed of being latina.

just a minute.

## i'm miserable, you know?
you could be a little more sensitive.

## where is the bag?
the bag with the money.

## was it supposed to be in the trunk?
look, don't play with me, little girl.

## and who the hell are you?
i am a woman with a conscience.

## shall we give it another go?
that was just a little misunderstanding.

## whose adorable dog is that?
hotel policy does not allow... our four legged family members to stay with us.

## fifi, what's wrong?
oh, i've seen a lot, but this one's a real doozy.

## i believe beauty does come from within... but why not let your beauty show on the outside... and share it with the whole world?
if you got it, flaunt it.

## fifi, what is it?
come here.

## aw, they let you have a dog?
how nice.

## fifi, what is it baby?
come here.

## would you stop fooling around with that dog?
the money.

i dunno what happened.

## i think they're at the don quixote puppet.
what?

## the don quixote puppet at the festival?
yeah.

## i say, what better way to show that a woman can be both beautiful and intelligent?
our goal, people, should be to celebrate the diverse... and the wonderful qualities of today's latin woman.

i can explain this whole thing.

## what were you doing up there?
it was amazing, cici.

## really?

## got the map?

## you know what?
i think we're gonna make it.

## you know what?
for a lawyer, you make a hell of a beauty contestant.

## you know what?
i don't know what got into me.

## you really think so?
definitely.

## you know what?
for a cocktail waitress, she's quite a mastermind.

## what was that?

1 5 minutes.

## let's be careful, we got that?
i've got your back.

## who's going in first?
ok, let's go.

## who's going down first?
i am.

## do you read me?
we're good.

## what's going on?
all right?\"\\"all right\\"is not the word.

## what have you got?
come here.

## what is it?
oh, my god.

## it's amazing.... son of a bitch would deliberately damage something so beautiful?
hold this.

## what are you doing, marek?
it's ok.

## what are you doing?
it's definitely a modern day bifocal lens.

## what is this?
one of the documents you found.

## \\"4/ 2/ 1357\"?
1357.

## what is going on?
i cross matched the signatures.

## what's going on here?
francois is looking for his spare pair.

## what have you been smoking?
maybe you can explain.

## did you carbon date the ink?
of course.

## have i made myself clear?
just tell us when and where.

## what is it?
doniger's sending a plane for us.

## we're going to new mexico?
let's pack up, guys.

## where's my dad?
you'il see your dad shortly.

## where's doniger at?
pleading for help.

## like a fax or something?
exactly.

## he's trying to send actual objects from one place to another?
follow me.

## you actually made it work?
yes.

## the prototype?
so that thing that we just passed...

## exactly.... is the real thing?
we asked the same question.

## so, what does that mean?
the camera was taking photographs of a wilderness near castlegard, france in the year 1 357.

## so you're saying you accidentally discovered time travel?
no, we accidentally discovered a wormhole.

## so you faxed my father's glasses and documents back to the 1 4th century?
no, chris.

## what?
we need you to help get him back.

## did he know about all this?
i thought we could help each other.

## how could you send him there?
god knows where he is...

## you sent the professor to the hundred years 'war?
right.

## we step on that machine and whiz back to 1357 to get him back?
once he's broken us into a stream of electrons.

## why should we do what you ask us?
i think we need to know more...

## bob?
excuse me.

## what?
come on.

## you don't think they deserve to know that?
i've told them enough.

## how did my father get stuck back there?
doniger gave him an hour.

## i guess it's better him than you, right?
listen, there's a few things we have to go over before we leave.

## why do we need marines?
just in case something goes wrong.

## do you understand what it does?
it strips you down to a molecular level, which means, for a moment, you cease to exist.

## why do we need him?
because he speaks french fluently.

## keep a couple of beers cold for me, all right?
mr. stern.

## watch our backs, ok?
it will be all right.

## you know the 50 bucks i owe you?
all right, let's move it.

## what about weapons?
nothing modern goes back.

## countdown?
they burn out after six hours.

## and then?
i'il get you back before you know it.

## are we set?
all systems check.

## mr. marek?
mr. marek, i need you to take your position.

## what the hell are we doing?
getting the chance of a lifetime.

## how long does it take?
a couple of seconds.

## here, take my hand.
where is he?

## everybody all right?
that was a close one.

## gordon, is this it?
i think so.

## are we in 1357 france?
this could be oregon.

## but don't.
gordon, where are we?

## why?
we haven't found his dad yet.

## where's marek?
the guys came after baretto.

## where's gomez?
i didn't see him.

## what are you doing?
oh, shit.

## what are you doing?
i'm getting us out of here.

## what?
i was trying to tell you.

## what about gomez?
we can't do anything about him now.

## give me your gloves.
what happened to the rest of them?

## well, did anyone try to come back with him?
i don't know.

## i know as much as you, ok?
hang on.

## what if they're trying to come back now?
it's not gonna happen...

## where is everyone going?
hold on a second.

## what day is this?
marek...

## the day la roque falls?
wait, wait.

## what are you talking about?
you son of a bitch.

## excuse me?
you brought us back on the day the french attack.

## how long will this take?
five hours and 27 minutes.

## how do you know it's gonna take 5 hours and 27 minutes?
because that's all the time we have.

## once this platform is fixed, even if the markers run out, we can send someone back to get them?
the thing holding the wormhole open is their markers.

## is that what you're saying?
they could be.

## what if my dad's in there?
yeah, you're right.

## how are we gonna get in?
guys, soldiers coming.

## come on, my friend.
why aren't you packing up?

## who are they?
we captured them in the village.

## who speaks for you?

## what is it?
oh, my god.

## it's amazing.... son of a bitch would deliberately damage something so beautiful?
hold this.

## what are you doing, marek?
it's ok.

## what are you doing?
it's definitely a modern day bifocal lens.

## what is this?
one of the documents you found.

## \\"4/ 2/ 1357\"?
1357.

## what is going on?
i cross matched the signatures.

## what's going on here?
franois is looking for his spare pair.

## what have you been smoking?
maybe you can explain.

## did you carbon date the ink?
of course.

## have i made myself clear?
just tell us when and where.

## what is it?
doniger's sending a plane for us.

## we're going to new mexico?
let's pack up, guys.

## where's my dad?
you'il see your dad shortly.

## where's doniger at?
pleading for help.

## like a fax or something?
exactly.

## he's trying to send actual objects from one place to another?
follow me.

## you actually made it work?
yes.

## the prototype?
so that thing that we just passed...

## exactly.... is the real thing?
we asked the same question.

## so, what does that mean?
the camera was taking photographs of a wilderness near castlegard, france in the year 1357.

## so you're saying you accidentally discovered time travel?
no, we accidentally discovered a wormhole.

## so you faxed my father's glasses and documents back to the 1 4th century?
no, chris.

## what?
we need you to help get him back.

## did he know about all this?
i thought we could help each other.

## how could you send him there?
god knows where he is...

## you sent the professor to the hundred years 'war?
right.

## we step on that machine and whiz back to 1357 to get him back?
once he's broken us into a stream of electrons.

## why should we do what you ask us?
i think we need to know more...

## bob?
excuse me, i need to get them changed if they're going to go.

## what?
come on.

## you don't think they deserve to know that?
i've told them enough.

## how did my father get stuck back there?
doniger gave him an hour.

## i guess it's better him than you, right?
listen, there's a few things we have to go over before we leave.

## why do we need marines?
just in case something goes wrong.

## do you understand what it does?
it strips you down to a molecular level. which means, for a moment, you cease to exist.

## why do we need him?
because he speaks french fluently.

## keep a couple of beers cold for me, all right?
mr. stern.

## watch our backs, ok?
it will be all right.

## you know the 50 bucks i owe you?
all right, let's move it.

## what about weapons?
nothing modern goes back.

## countdown?
they burn out after six hours.

## and then?
i'il get you back before you know it.

## are we set?
all systems check.

## mr. marek?
mr. marek.

## what the hell are we doing?
getting the chance of a lifetime.

## how long does it take?
a couple of seconds.

## here, take my hand.
where is he?

## everybody all right?
that was a close one.

## gordon, is this it?
i think so.

## are we in 1357 france?
this could be oregon.

## but don't.
gordon, where are we?

## why?
we haven't found his dad yet.

## where's marek?
the guys came after baretto.

## where's gomez?
i didn't see him.

## what are you doing?
oh, shit, i can't find his marker.

## what are you doing?
i'm getting us out of here.

## what?
i was trying to tell you.

## what about gomez?
we can't do anything about him now.

## give me your gloves.
what happened to the rest of them?

## well, did anyone try to come back with him?
i don't know.

## i know as much as you, ok?
hang on.

## what if they're trying to come back now?
it's not gonna happen...

## where is everyone going?
hold on a second.

## what day is this?
marek...

## the day la roque falls?
wait, wait.

## excuse me?
you brought us back on the day the french attack.

## how long will this take?
five hours and 27 minutes.

## how do you know it's gonna take 5 hours and 27 minutes?
because that's all the time we have.

## once this platform is fixed, even if the markers run out, we can send someone back to get them?
the thing holding the wormhole open is their markers.

## is that what you're saying?
they could be.

## what if my dad's in there?
yeah, you're right.

## how are we gonna get in?
guys, soldiers coming.

## come on, my friend.
why aren't you packing up?

## who are they?
we captured them in the village.

## who speaks for you?
i do, my lord.

i'm a friend of your mom's.

## could you give your mom a couple of these... and tell 'em to hand 'em out to her friends or whoever?
kay.

## why the heck you throwin 'crap at my van, napoleon?
everybody at school thinks i'm a freakin 'idiot 'cause of you.

shh.

## napoleon?
you stop wishin ', and call me when you're ready.

## napoleon?

## who's this?
it's deb... and i'm calling to let you know i think you're a shallow friend.

## what the heck are you even talkin 'about?
don't lie, napoleon.

## what?
i don't need herbal enhancers to feel good about myself.

## and if you're so concerned about that, why don't you try eating some yourself?
good.

## do you have anything to give to her?
no, not unless she likes fish.

## are you still gonna give your speech tomorrow?

now, if you look right here, we have sallyjohnson from manitou, colorado.

## would you like to read her testimonial right there?
sure.

## but do you feel comfortable with me?
you could be... somewhere around, uh... here.

## anyway, i think i'd be a great class president, so, uh... who wants to eat\\"chimini changas '\"next year?
not me.

## a skit?
you perform a skit after your speech, pedro.

## why didn't anybody tell us about this?

## kipland ronald dynamite... do you take lafawnduh lucas to be your lawful wedded wife... in sickness and health till death do you part?
you know i do.

## hey, deb, can you take a photo of me on the horse real quick?
sure.

## what is so important that you interrupt us?
prince frederick of saxony.

## you mean you've traveled all the way from rome just in order to advise us about this small matter?
heresy is never a small matter, my lord.

## how would people fare left to themselves, helpless and frightened?
all my life, i have seen a world that hates evil more than it loves good.

## did you really think there wouldn't be a cost?
it is simply a matter of individual conscience.

## do you, martin luther, recognize these books?
tle 95 tleses.

## are you the author?
all are mine.

## do you recant what you've written?
i...

## may i have time to consider?
you have had the time, and you should have been prepared to answer.

## where's his boasting...?
i am yours.

## martin luther, are you the author of these writings?
i am.

## do you recant what you have written here?
i cannot renounce all of my works because they are not all the same.

## will you recant or will you not?
since your majesty and your lordships desire a simple reply...

## what do you say?
he is too daring for me, my lord.

## why are they leaving us?
wait.

## why are you babbling in riddles?
beware, or you too shall be cut down.

## what?
i asked for a greek new testament.

## to have a new testament in german, in words ordinary people can understand?
it's the thing rome fears most.

## how do you expect to do this?
we must send in soldiers.

## and cause more bloodshed?
if wittenberg cannot settle its religious problems without that, then the rest of the world will not be impressed.

## how's the work?
tricky.

## how can i write for our people when i don't live among them?
the language of the bible should be like a mother talking to her children.

## why were they killed?
no reason.

## you, why are you standing there?
when a limb is rotten, you must cut it off.

## beat me out?
i defended you.

## you think this is my work?
it's the people's work.

## now, how is he?
luther's depressed, my lord.

## but he will join them?
luther abhors violence.

## but he's in sympathy with their grievances?
it's hard to argue against freeing people from crippling taxes or the purgatory of being born slaves all their lives.

## how many?
no one knows yet.

## how many?
some say 50, 000.

## and... you still came here?
because this is where dr. luther lives.

## who's there?
no.

## martin luther?
my lord.

## into german?
but this will separate us from rome... forever.

## with no compromises?
none.

## do you think i could have my present now?
send it back.

## what has happened?
the emperor summons our princes to augsburg.

## why?
to finish what he began at worms.

## how will you make them change their minds?
i don't know.

## if we challenge charles, will there be war... the awful shedding of yet more blood?
i honestly don't know.

## or our greatest opportunity so far?
and remember, since i may not come with you to augsburg, you'il face charles 'rough alone.

## and why does the father run to meet his prodigal son?
landowners don't run.

## so why does this rich, landowning father run?
because he's afraid.

## and you know what this word means?
god brought me here.

## i live in terror of judgment.
god?

## i wish there were no god.
and you think self hatred will save you?

## name of the deceased and relation?
hendrick luther.

## name of the deceased and relation?
wolfram eschen, uncle.

## let's go outside.
and you think rome unique in such relics?

## what's wrong with here?
well, this floor... the color.

## have you ever read the new testament, martin?
no, father.

## wittenberg?
a doctorate in theology.

## you're sending me away to study?
i'm sending you to the source... the scriptures.

## here i'm losing my faith, feeling like a fool even to pray, and you're sending me away?
you'il preach.

## to change things?
welcome to wittenberg, father martin.

## a child living in the forest?
a crippled child.

## half or full bundle?
as much as this will buy.

## they thought i wanted their money?
no, they thought the pope wanted their money.

## the greek christians?
well, an early church document clearly states that a roman bishop, not a greek, was saint peter's successor.

## so we must consider the saints of the greek church to be damned?
you miss the point.

## you question the authority of the church council, sir?
if only we knew what was in his head.

## what does god say, father, for suicide?
i never, never said i had the answers.

## is this child any more to blame for the despair that overtook him than an innocent man who is murdered by a robber in the woods?
god must be mercy.

## what of it?
for i know one who suffered and made satisfaction in my behalf.

## to teach theology?
he undermines the prince.

## was i an arrogant fool?
now they have made me a doctor of divinity, and i'm tempted to believe that this scholar's robe will make me wise.

## did you buy an indulgence?
no.

## master kranauer, is luther open to persuasion?
not likely, my prince.

## as a donkey, you were going to say?
indeed, indeed.

## quite dignified looking, isn't he?
but it's not what julius wanted.

## what is it you seek, aleander?
to serve god.

## moreover, wasn't he underage when granted his first post?
just so.

## the imperial bankers?
an eight year loan.

## and how would he repay them?
even one finger made raw by the flame will torment you throughout the night.

## are we to be spared the fires of damnation on the judgment day?
take heed the words of your holy father who says,

## how?
with this indulgence.

## when?
tonight, and only tonight.

## do you not hear their voices, the screaming voices?
your deceased parents.

## god fearing man, do you have a coin for christ?
yes.

## name?
we can preach until we're hoarse, but if we cannot bring the christ of the gospels to our people...

## issued by the archbishop of mainz.
... what do we offer them?

## where did you get this?
juterbog.

## it's no good?
you must put your trust in god's love.

## german money for the german church.
if the pope can empty purgatory, why would he not do so out of love rather than for money?

## or saint paul?
we don't need your saints.

## or any of the holy apostles?
with this indulgence, i can absolve any sin.

## sober him.
how will you explain this to rome?

## why?
i did not want him compromised.

## do you have any idea how embarrassing this is to prince frederick, his prize professor of theology drawing condemnation from the pope?
my criticism was not of the holy father himself, but of those rogues who claim to represent him.

## what happens now?
i honestly don't know.

## have i caused you trouble too?
i'm here to get you through this.

## that's a good sign, isn't it?
that means that rome must understand.

## do you understand?
yes.

## have i erred?
yes, you have erred.

## how?
that i may avoid such error again.

## which of my teachings is offensive to rome?
for one, indulgences.

## comfort?
the turks are building armies on our eastern borders.

## or shall we call it extravagante like the rest of the world?
he's a heretic.

## what?
then there is only one way to save your life.

## my prince. how shall i answer?
the cardinal demands that luther be delivered to rome or banished from saxony.

## have you read luther's work?
yes, all of it.

## did he show any inclination then of surrender to influence?
no.

## so what shall we say to the cardinal?
nothing.

## and the second?
and the second is to say no in such a kind and thoughtful way it befuddles them.

## who are they to deprive my university of such a fine mind?
your little german monk is still spewing filth at us.

## so he does not play like a gentleman?
ordinary germans can quote his work.

## i don't suppose your little monk would be interested in a cardinal's hat?
i think he would be ashamed to wear it, your holiness.

## bj hookstratten?
that`s more impressive than being in the top %%.

## where else do you have to be?
my job.

## mitcheii mcdeere?
yes.

## care for a drink?
i`m fine.

## tired of interwiews?

of course.

## did mr lambert as senior partner give you instructions regarding my employment?
he did.

## mr mcknight, do you foilow mr lambert`s instructions?
objection vague, ambiguous.

## what precisely were those instructions?
that you were in great demand and i should make certain that we obtain your serwices before a bidding situation developed.

## how did you go about making certain?
i bribed a clerk in the harward law placement office for the exact amount of the highest offer and then added 20 %.

## memphis?
that`s what i thought untii their offer.

## what was the offer?
they didn`t say.

## what?

you don't know with this party.

## so, you gonna give him any play?
i don't know.

## ok?
i ain't the black male model.

## you gonna hook me up, man?
you should hire a lawyer to negotiate your contract.

## yeah, i mean, why pay an agent 4 % to negotiate numbers that are already set by a salary base cap?
dre, don't say anything.

## what's that supposed to mean?
nothing.

## what's that supposed to mean?
maybe this is not the best place...

## yeah, well, how... how do you feel with them being so close?
well, let's just say it's very hard to get used to.

## can we just drop this already?
tell...

## all right?
i don't care what...

## all right, can i get a hug?
good friends.

## mmm... what you got there?

## you got your cab with you?
wait a minute.

## dre, think about this, ok?
let's just go.

## huh... you...

## how are you doin '?
ha ha... it's funny runnin 'into you here, singing love songs to each other.

## you mind if we join you?
no, not at all.

## why you all stiff?
reesey...

## you are?
richard lawson.

## i, um... you guys, um, friends of reese's?
yeah, well, actually, the funny thing is, she's my wife.

## what?
oh...

## how could you know?
she ain't wearing the $15, 000 ring that i bought her ass.

## will you be joining us for dinner?
listen, my man...

## you know what?
we were just about to leave.

## my divorce how about that?
and some pork chops.

## all right?
you're making a scene.

## you know what i'm sayin '?
bye bye, richard lawson.

## you remember my first little beat machine?
boy, you thought you were d nice.

## vodka?
uh, no.

## how can you... joke about this?
cause i would be flipping out.

## you know what, though?
i...

## yeah?
mm.

## and when did you figure that out?
the night before the wedding.

## do you, uh... you know anybody like that?
no, i don't.

## no?
but...

## oh, yeah?
and... she realized it was nothing more than just friends.

## nothing?
nothing.

## just friends?
just friends.

## don't you get it?
this was bad.

## where are my shoes?
they're downstairs.

## where you goin '?
this is your spot.

## are you gonna tell him?
i don't know.

## well, you're not gonna... are you still gonna marry this cat after what we just had?
dre... what just happened was the most... amazing... most fulfilling... most exhilarating... 5 minutes i've ever had in my life.

## 9?
ok.

## the point is, what do we do now?
we can't just go back to the way things were.

## what are you saying?
i need space.

## why does it have to be all or nothing?
because we both know it's the right thing to do.

## but, you know, when you go in there, just, you know, be firm with them, you know what i'm sayin '?
yeah.

## you were feeling her, right?
yeah.

## she wanted you to stop her from marrying the old dude, but you let it ride, you know?
same thing bogey did, man.

## why not?
cause he's humphrey bogart.

## you know what he needed to do back then?
he needed to stop fine ass ingrid bergman from gettin 'on the plane with the corny dude.

## with another dude, in the fog?
come on.

## 2 grown men walk off in a fog, you don't know where they goin '?
think about it, man.

## can you leave me a couple more of those?
and thanks for coming by.

## i said to give me space and then you pull this stuff?
what...

## what are you talkin 'about?
guess what demo i heard for our unsigned underground review today.

## are you serious?
dre, don't act like you didn't plan this.

## why would i need to plan?
i could have just given it to you at any time.

## why'd you give it to gabe?
i gave you money to help start the label.

## doesn't the conflict of interest seem obvious?
all right.

## well, what did gabe say?
it wasn't a bad review.

## what's wrong with getting in touch with why we both fell in love with hip hop in the first place?
cause it's about forward movement.

## and that's why we need to look back, ok?
cause if we look back, it will make us see things...

## are we... are we still talking about hip hop?
that's all we've ever talked about.

## sid?
hey.

## can i get you something, sir?
yes.

## you couldn't afford it then, remember?
i had to keep playing if i was gonna get your number.

## so we could have a drink, laugh on our good times, and, uh, act like none of this ever happened?
yes and no.

## are you serious?
dre, let me finish.

## another round?
damn.

## what am i talking about?
you don't want to get married.

## didn't i already see you?
mm, yeah.

## so what are you doing back here?
i know that y'all put a new song in rotation every week.

## you're not playin '?
i'm not playin ', man.

## you for real?
yes, man.

## still thinking about sidney, huh?
yeah, man.

## who you callin 'punk?
i know you be trippin '.

## sid shaw, editor of xxl magazine.
yeah, what?

## what's been going on?
oh, it's been mad crazy, working on the magazine, and, uh...

## it's about hip hop?
it's my love letter to hip hop.

## what, uh, what's the name of it?
it's called i used to love him.

## like the common joint?
mm hmm.

## um, you want to dedicate it to anybody?
yeah.

## where you from?
uh, the boogie down...

## uh, sidney shaw, when did you fall in love with hip hop?
when i heard kangol crew and get fresh crew.

## sid... when did you fall in love... with hip hop?
talk to him.

## uh, why'd it take you so long to say that?
cause i was scared.

## down here?
a big day for brown sugar records.

## you wanna go out with me?
they've shut down the main reactor.

## where have you been?
they're heading in this direction.

## wait a minute.
what are we going to do?

## where are you going?
the death star plans are not in the main computer.

## what have you done with those plans?
we intercepted no transmissions.

## if this is a consular ship... were is the ambassador?
commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the ambassador.

## that's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here.
secret mission?

## are you sure this things safe?
lord vader, i should have known.

## how did i get into this mess?
i really don't know how.

## where are you going?
well, i'm not going that way.

## what makes you think there are settlements over there?
don't get technical with me.

## he tricked me into going this way, but he'il do no better.
what mission?

## we're doomed.
wait, what's that?

## will this never end?
luke, tell owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks bocce.

## do you speak bocce?
of course i can, sir.

## luke, take these two over to the garage, will you?
we'il take that one.

## you know of the rebellion against the empire?
that's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.

## have you been in many battles?
several, i think.

## what is what?!?
he asked you a question...

## what is that?
help me, obi wan kenobi.

## who is she?
she's beautiful.

## is there more to this recording?
behave yourself, artoo.

## i beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?
well, i don't know anyone named obi wan, but old ben lives out beyond the dune sea.

## play back the entire message.
where'd she go?

## you know, i think that r2 unit we bought might have been stolen.
what message?

## what makes you think that?
well, i stumbled across a recording while i was cleaning him.

## do you know what he's talking about?
well, i wonder if he's related to ben.

## he died about the same time as your father.
but what if this obi wan comes looking for him?

## he knew my father?
i told you to forget it.

## you mean the next semester before harvest?
sure, there're more than enough droids.

## where are you going?
it looks like i'm going nowhere.

## what are you doing hiding there?
it wasn't my fault, sir.

## how could i be so stupid?
it's too dangerous with all the sandpeople around.

## have you seen luke this morning?
he said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early.

## did he take those two new droids with him?
i think so.

## hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going?
master luke here is your rightful owner.

## what's wrong with him now?
he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast.

## the jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly.
ben?

## he claims to be the property of an obi wan kenobi.
tell me young luke, what brings you out this far?

## do you know who he's talking about?
now thats a name i haven't heard in a long time... a long time.

## do you know him?
well of course, of course i know him.

## where am i?
i must have taken a bad step...

## can you stand?
we've got to get out of here before the sandpeople return.

## what kind of talk is that?
quickly, son... they're on the move.

## you fought in the clone wars?
yes, i was once a jedi knight the same as your father.

## what is it?
your fathers lightsaber. his is the weapon of a jedi knight.

## how did my father die?
a young jedi named darth vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the empire hunt down and destroy the jedi knights.

## the force?
well, the force is what gives a jedi his power.

## alderaan?
i'm not going to alderaan.

## how am i ever going to explain this?
the regional governors now have direct control over their territories.

## and what of the rebellion?
the plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.

## why would imperial troops want to slaughter jawas?
if they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to.

## how long have you had these droids?
about three or four seasons.

## do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'il take us to alderaan?
your droids.

## she's fast enough for you, old man.
fast ship?

## what's the cargo?
only passengers.

## some kind of local trouble?
let's just say we'd like to avoid any imperial entanglements.

## well, that's the trick, isn't it?
and it's going to cost you something extra.

## you?
you bet i could.

## going somewhere, solo?
yes, greedo.

## do you think i had a choice?
you can tell that to jabba.

## what course shall we set?
perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.

## what do you mean?
i think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station.

## you didn't think i was going to run did you?
han, my boy, there are times when you surprise me.

## and why did you have to fry poor greedo like that, after all we're been throught together?
look jabba, next time you want to talk to me, come and see me yourself.

## where would i be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment...... at the first sign of an imperial starship?
it's not good business.

## do you think i had a choice?
i got a nice easy charter now.

## why don't you outrun them?
it'il take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi computer.

## what's that flashing?
we're losing our deflector shield.

## so it'il be the last time.
you would prefer another target?

## where is the rebel base?
dantooine.

## what?
you're far too trusting.

## what's wrong?
i felt a great disturbance in the force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.

## you mean it controls your actions?
partially.

## you don't believe in the force, do you?
kid, i've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.

## how am i supposed to fight?
your eyes can deceive you.

## going good against the living?
that's something else.

## what the...?
aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.

## where is it?
thats what i'm trying to tell you, kid.

## there aren't any bases around here.
what?

## where did it come from?
it sure is leaving in a big hurry.

## several of the escape pods have been jettisoned.
why are we still moving towards it?

## did you find any droids?
the ship's all yours.

## hey down there, could you give us a hand with this?
tx four one two.

## tx four one two, do you copy?
take over.

## where did you dig up that old fossil?
ben is a great man.

## what is it?
i'm afraid i'm not quite sure, sir.

## well, who... who has he found?
princess leia.

## where is she?
level five.

## rich?
yes.

## what?
well more wealth that you can imagine.

## uh... threepio, hand me those binders there will you?
okay.

## where are you taking this... thing?
prisoner transfer from block one one three eight.

## what happened?
uh... had a slight weapons malfunction.

## how are you?
we're sending a squad up.

## what's your operating number?
oh... the uniform.

## you're who?
this is some rescue.

## when you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out?
he's the brains, sweetheart.

## what the hell are you doing?
i already tried it.

## what happened?
i don't know, it just let go of me and disappeared...

## do you copy?
shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level.

## where are you going?
no, wait.

## it's a wonder you're still alive.
okay?

## will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?
no reward is worth this.

## do you know what's going on?
maybe it's another drill.

## what was that?
oh, it's nothing.

## are you safe?
for the moment.

## you came in that thing?
you're braver that i thought.

## what good will it do us if he gets himself killed?
i think we took a wrong turn.

## what kept you?
we ran into some old friends.

## is the ship all right?
seems okay, if we can get to it.

## this is all your fault.
you hear me, baby?

## are they away?
they have just made the jump into hyperspace.

## you're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship?
i'm taking an awful risk, vader.

## not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?
you know, sometimes i even amaze myself.

## at least the information in artoo is still intact.
easy... you call that easy?

## what's he carrying?
the technical readouts of that battle station.

## pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?
well, the empire doesn't consider a small one man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense.

## i got some old debts i've got to pay off with this stuff.
so... you got your reward and you're just leaving then?

## why don't you come with us?
you know what's about to happen, what they're up against.

## what good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?
besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage.

## what're you lookin 'at?
i know what i'm doing.

## are you sure you can handle this ship?
sir, luke is the best bushpilot in the outer rim territories.

## all right?
i told you i'd make it someday, biggs.

## that little droid and i have been through a lot together.
do you want a new one?

## you okay, artoo?
good.

## you wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?
i got a little cooked, but i'm okay.

## red six can you see red five?
there's a heavy fire zone on this side.

## biggs, where are you?
thanks, wedge.

## right with you, boss.
should i have your ship standing by?

## luke, at that speed will you be able to pull out in time?
it'il be just like beggar's canyon back home.

## what's wrong?
i'm all right.

## what?
we'il get to work on him right away.

## going somewhere, solo?
it's too late.

## why haven't you paid me... and why did you fry poor greedo?
han, i can't make exceptions.

## what if everyone who smuggled for me... dropped their cargo at the first sign... of an imperial starship?
it's not good business.

## what the hell is this?
excuse me, young lady.

## what will happen?
if you're lucky, your daughter will become my wife.

## you don't like these girls?
yes it can.

## what are you going to do to me?
oh no, stop, please...

## let him go.
will you help me now?

## i want you to save my daughter... not to watch your stupid dance.
what the fuck are you doing?

## is he good enough for you yet?
that's nasty.

## but can your khun change his costume?
i'il hire him anyway.

## but how do we know...... where yai is keeping my daughter?

## where the hell did he from?
i guess he's a half breed, boss.

## and his father?
his father must be an alsatian.

## hey! this was open before.

## ko just jumped to his death, boss.
who the hell locked it?

## how about you?
noi.

## i guess you don't play nice.
would you be interested in working for me?

## where are you taking me?
you don't have to worry.

## he told you to carry me downstairs too?
your supple skin...... should not have a single scar on it.

## who said that?
my hand hurts from hitting you.

## what the fuck now?
i will kill the lift.

## what should we do now?
there's a lot of shooting up there.

## is this cool enough for you?
let's go.

## do you promise?

pain in the ass.

## what are you doing?

## won't you sacrifice your suit for me?
of course.

## what are you going to do?
i think you'd better stand still and watch.

## damned zombies?
your pulse is so faint.

## why are they following us?
i guess they are hungry.

## are we going to make it if we go this way?
fine.

## shouldn't we get out of here?
this is a magic whistle.

## understand?
blow my whistle for me.

## hey, khun.
why did you blow the whistle?

## what's wrong with you?
he was bitten.

## doctor, what's wrong with him?
your student has been infected with sars no.

## can he be cured?
but my medicine bag is upstairs...

## a medicine bag?
i'il go get it.

## have you forgotten your promise?
i have been protecting...... my virginity for well over 20 years.

my name is professor.

## you made us, so shouldn't you name us?

i think it's a little dark.

## time for school.

i've found my true mate, and you know it.

## was it not your sin trapped the unicorn?
no.

## judge me by my size, do you?
and well you should not.

## why doesn't anyone listen to me?
the fleet is beginning to break up.

## what did you have in mind for your next move?
well, if they follow standard lmperial procedure, they'il dump their garbage before they go to light speed, then we just float away.

## then what?
then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.

## got any ideas?
no.

## where are we?
the anoat system..

## lando system?
lando's not a system, he's a man.

## am i interrupting anything?
not really.

## will you join me for a little refreshment?
everyone's invited, of course.

## so you're part of the mining guild then?
no, not actually.

## aren't you afraid the empire's going to find out about this little operation and shut you down?
we're in danger.

## lord vader, what about leia and the wookiee?
i'm backwards, you stupid furball.

they'il have to stay here, but at least they'il be safe.

## what about han?
vader's giving him to the bounty hunter.

## luke?
lord vader has set a trap for him.

## well, calrissian, did he survive?
yes, he's alive.

## what do you think you're doing?
we're getting out of here.

## do you think that after what you did to han we're going to trust you?
i had no choice...

## oh, so we understand, don't we, chewie?
he had no choice.

## what?
it sounds like han.

## what are you talking about?
we're not interested in the hyperdrive on the millennium falcon.

## what?

## but what about those fighters?
chewie, just do it.

## but what about vader?
