you just can't teach some people.

## have you?
i didn't.

## mom?
i love you guys.

## did such a man as alexander exist?
of course not, they idolize him, make him better than he was.

## whatever expects you as a king, just because of your father, the first rule of war is to do what you ask your men to do, no more no less.
you think people respect you, you think they dont know your bastards?

## would you want me to let you win alexander?
your right, but i promise you i will beat you one day hephaistion.

## from generation to generation there stories have been past on, why?
unless there was truth to them.

## but if we are superior to the persians as you say, why do we not rule them?
it is, it has always been our greek dream to go east.

## master?
out with it, out with it.

## we practice control of our senses, moderation, we hope.
why are the persians so cool?

## he is a deeply selfish man.
and what of achilles at troy master?

## then would you say that the local achilles and procutules is a corrupting one?
philip brought aristotle from athens to educate our rough people, and growing more ambitious he now planned the invasion of persia.

## do i seem so old?
broken neck comes free he's too nervous for battle.

## and if you dont?
i'll pay for him myself.

## with what, your singing voice?
i'll pay you.

## why?
because he loved procutules and avenged his death.

## and his fate?
that he must die young, but with great glory.

## did he have a choice?
oh yes, live a long life but there would be no glory.

## your right, forgive me, a mother loves too much.
why?

## hephaistion loves me, as i am, not who.
who shall i sing to at night anymore?

## what's your name?
i'm chikini.

## huh, what's your name?
chikini.

## to philip our king, without home this union could not be possible.
would you prefer a seat cleitis?

## come leave some damn air in the hole?
and last i drink to the king's marriage to my niece a macedonian queen we can be proud of.

## he's afraid the man who called my mother a whore and me a bastard, and i dishoner you?
you listen like your mother, atlas is my family now the same as you.

## am i not fit to ground my mother walks on?
you dog, questioning your queen.

## and i'll have as many sons as i want and there's nothing you or your harpy mother could do about it.
shame?

## why drunken man must you think everything i do and say comes from my mother?
because i know her heart by hera.

## and this is the man who is going to take you from greece to persia?
he can't even make it from one couch to the next.

## this is madness, you will never get withing 100 paces of him.
kill their eyes?

## have you seen the sheer size of his force alexander?
not if you hold him on the left, my brave parmanion, with your son, for just 1, 2 hours tomorrow.

## and lads feast tonight, for tomorrow we will die in hades.
the lands west of the the hand of his daughter in marriage, since when has a greek ever been given such honors?

## to whom do you pray?
phobos.

## i alwasy believed alexander but this seems so much bigger than us.
are you ready for tomorrow's dawn?

## did die before achilles when they stood side by side at seed of troy?
petropolis died first.

## where across from us has gathered a vast army...
i remember you the day you took the seed tower at tire, you were a giant, and today how will you fight?

## who is this king, but a king of air?
don't know majesty.

## you bleed free my lord, may i tend to your wound?
gloucus my king.

## gloucus and where is your home?
elyria.

## not for the men who fought i trust?
we will pay them well.

## by the gods what is this?
no wonder dorius fled, he had this to come back to.

## help me aphroditi, how will i ever go back to after this?
i advise you not to touch here i'll take care of it for you.

## look now, into my eyes, princess, and tell me how would you like to be treated?
as i am, a princess.

## alexander!, this is about the other of our kingdom.
how so?

## exactly, what can be won alexander?
to found cities, and expand our reach is not to drift parmenion.

## what benefit to macedon?
it's far richer than before.

## what would you given them?
with respect for your age parmenion that you fought better, dug a metal when your flank was crumbling we could have had dorius..

## was it over ripe in reason like yours?
better than you really are, in you and those like you is this.

## you love him?
he is epheistian.

## great man, scared now?
you i kill now.

## if only you were not a pale reflection from my mothers heart.
who is this woman you call your queen alexander?

## who did this?
tell me.

## but first the men must seek homes.
you remember what aristotle told us of these mountains?

## have you found your home?
tell me.

## claytis, bring the snake healers,...
where has our eagle gone?

## what happened lad?
it is to the neck.

## epheistian, neiarcus, perticus.
you call governing this major province, exile?

## you accept greek offerings as a son of zeus do you not?
i have achieved more in my years, traveled as far, probably farther.

## now your his then?
take a barbarian, jealous wife, and dirt color queen.

## does not your great pride fear the gold any longer?
a great deafspot falls king.

## and he needs you?
ephistian you make a mistake.

## no guard your majesty with all this crowd?
greeks all over the place.

## go.
you want the world to say your my successor?

## how can you pay so shamelessly in public?
because it was meant to be.

## shame is?
so many wanted it, greeks, persian, men.

## have you learned nothing from philip?
no from you mother.

## all you desire, the world is yours, take it.
what have i done, to make you hate me so?

## kiss/ kids?
he never saw his mother again.

## silence?
we will never leave you alexander.

## because you have fallen in love with all the things in life that destroy men.
who are these tribes ahead compared to those we have vanquished?

## who said that?
he dove on, south to the outer ocean.

## but how can this be, tiphis of india?
oh i wouldn't tax yourself your majesty, a few good nights rest will do it, but no wine, or...

## and you petroplis, and then what happened?
get out.

## who?
many hated him, but i dont think any other would have dared.

## ephistian is dead?
wait a minute.

## are you mad?
taken from me all that i have ever known.

## huh, what failure?
his failure towered over other men's successes.

## and only now in old do i understand who this force of nature really was.
but what does it all mean?

## did such a man as alexander exist?
your right.

## why is it master, in myth these lands you speak of are known?
india, where heracles, and dionysus traveled.

## thesius, jason, achilles,.. were victorious?
from generation to generation their stories have been past on.

## tales of amazons?
no, alexander, only common people believe these tales... as they believe most anything.

## but if we are superior to the persians as you say, why do we not rule them?
it is, it has always been our greek dream to go east.

## master?
out with it, out with it.

## why are the persians so cruel?
achilles simply lacks restraint.

## but for you..
is that the best you can do, cleitus?

## do i seem so old?
a broken neck comes free, fool.

## and if you don't?
i'll pay for him myself.

## with what, your singing voice?
i'll pay you.

## really?
perhaps you'll make a musician out of him yet.

## see?
he is my favorite.

## why?
because he loved patroclus and avenged his death.

## and his fate?
that he must die young, but with great glory.

## did he have a choice?
oh yes:to live a long life, but there would be no glory.

## do you hear me?
say nothing.

## hephaistion loves me,.. as i am, not who.
who shall i sing to sleep at night anymore?

## loves?
in the name of dionysus,... understand how philip thinks.

## what's your name?
antigone.

## huh, what's your name?
antigone.

## would you prefer a seat, cleitus?
i'll sleep in my grave, hephaistion.

## don't expect me to sit here and watch you shame yourself.
you defend the man who called my mother a whore and me a bastard!.. and i dishonor you?

## why, you drunken man, must you think everything i do and say comes from my mother?
he can't even make it from one couch to the next.

## this is madness, you will never get withing a hundred paces of him.
kill their eyes?

## have you seen the sheer size of his force, alexander?
not if you hold him on the left, my brave parmenion, with your son, philotas, for just one, two hours tomorrow.

## the hand of his daughter in marriage,.. since when has a greek ever been given such honors?
come alexander, we are still not really sure if it was persian gold behind the assassination.

## to whom do you pray?
phobos.

## are you ready for tomorrow's dawn?
ah, it's been too long coming if you ask me, i mean,.. they're skittish as colts.

## did patroclus doubt achilles when they stood side by side at seige of troy?
dexippos.

## darius has at last gathered a vast army...
by athena,.. how far was it you threw your man wrestling at the last olympic games?

## who is this king, but a king of air?
no, hermolaos, not now.

## what shall i call you?
gloukas, my king.

## and where is your home?
illyria.

## not for the men who fought i trust?
we'll pay them well, antigonus.

## how will i ever go back to lysimacheia after this?
i advise you not to touch the anatomy.

## princess, and tell me, how would you like to be treated?
as i am, a princess.

## why won't you ever believe me?
it is only a dark mind like mine that can know these secrets of the heart.

## how so?
when i was a child, my mother thought me devine, my father weak.

## and what's the point alexander?
just take her as your concubine.

## exactly, what can be won alexander?
we came here to asia to punish them for their crimes.

## to give these people cities?
to found cities, and expand our reach is not to drift parmenion.

## he consulted his peers in counsel, among equals, hmmn?
better than you really are, in you and those like you is this.

## why?
some say it was for alliance with the tribes.

## you love him?
he is hephaistion.

## great man, scared?
you i kill now.

## if only you were not a pale reflection from my mother's heart.
who is this woman you call your queen, alexander?

## who did this?
we'll be divided.

## or the mountains of the hindu kush...... when we crossed a 100, 000 man army into india...?
he was a god, cadmos...... or as close as anything i've ever seen.

## what do they know of the world, these schoolboys?
it takes strong men to rule.

## how can i tell you what it was like...... to be young, and to dream big dreams?
to believe when alexander looked you in the eye, you could do anything.

## if you hesitate, she will strike.
or do i?

## remember that, hmm?
never hesitate.

## you think they don't know your bastards?
damn your sorceress soul.

## but is it possible... that the source of egypt's mighty river nile...... could rise in these distant mountains of the outer earth?
india, where herakles and dionysus traveled...... all these men who went east, theseus...... jason, achilles, were victorious.

## why?
unless there was truth to them.

## tales of amazons?
no, alexander.

## but if we are superior to the persians, as you say, why do we not rule them?
it is...

## why are the persians so cruel?
when men lie together in lust, it is a surrender to the passions...... and does nothing for the excellence in us.

## i'll ride him.
is that the best you can do, cleitus?

## it's time.
and if you don't?

## you don't like your shadow, do you?
it's like a dark spirit coming up to get you.

## and his fate?
that he must die young, but with great glory.

## miserable fate.
did he have a choice?

## who knows these things?
anyway...

## when i'm king like you one day, father?
say nothing.

## who shall i sing to sleep at night anymore?
i wish we could spend more time together.

## loves?
in the name of dionysus...... understand how philip thinks...... for your own sake.

## would you prefer a seat, cleitus?
i'll sleep in my grave, hephaistion.

## who's your new friend?
he can't even make it from one couch to the next.

## you'll never get within a hundred paces of him.
kill darius?

## have you seen the sheer size of his force?
not if you hold them on the left, my brave parmenion...... with your son philotas, for just one, two hours tomorrow.

## when has a greek ever been given such honors?
these are not honors, parmenion.

## to whom do you pray?
phobos.

## fear?
it's been too long coming, if you ask me.

## did patroclus doubt achilles when they stood side by side at the siege of troy?
i don't know, majesty.

## you bleed free, my lord.
where is he?

## may i tend to your wounds?
no, hermolaus, not now.

## wealth in great quantities brings the crows.
what shall i call you?

## not for the men who fought, i trust?
we'll pay them well, antigonous... but not as mercenaries for future services.

## what is this?
i advise you not to touch, leonnatus.

## do these images fool us with their beauty and degrade our souls?
as i am... a princess.

## have you any other requests for me, my noble princess?
no.

## why won't you ever believe me?
it is only a dark mind like mine...... that can know these secrets of the heart.

## when i'm the cracked mirror of her dreams?
stay with me tonight, hephaistion.

## how so?
but as alexander's army, they can go where they never thought possible.

## is there not love in your life...... alexander?
i wonder sometimes, if it's not your mother you run from.

## who knows these things?
when i was a child, my mother thought me divine, my father weak.

## weak or divine?
just take her as your concubine.

## what can be won, alexander?
to found cities and expand our reach is not to drift.

## share our rewards?
you remember what aristotle said.

## better than you really are?
in you and those like you is this.

## why?
he is hephaistion.

## with your breeding?
i have given you ample proof.

## what to do with parmenion and his 20, 000 troops guarding our supply lines...... was a far more delicate matter.
who did this?

## was he innocent in this...... or had he decided to act before age further withered his power?
they'll be divided.

## you remember what aristotle told us of these mountains?
yes, i do.

## have you found your home, ptolemy?
more and more, i think it will be alexandria.

## where has our eagle gone?
we must go on, ptolemy...... until we find an end.

## do they speak?
only when offered.

## you bow before herakles, do you not?
and he was mortal...... but a son of zeus.

## why not?
i remember a time when we could talk as men, straight to the eye.

## who's with him?
you made me do your foul deed.

## cleitus?
no.

## he doesn't.
cleitus?

## and he needs you?
hephaistion, you make a mistake.

## have i become so arrogant that i am blind?
sometimes...... to expect the best of everyone is arrogance.

## weren't you told?
i go in alone.

## go.
is that what she wants?

## how can you behave so shamelessly in public?
because it was meant to be.

## tell me, or shall i put you on trial for his murder?
no, never.

## why would i?
even if it was the wish of your heart.

## what do you know of philip?
no, alexander.

## have you learned nothing from philip?
one day, you will understand this...... but i have only you in my heart...

## your majesty?
you break my heart.

## you men, afraid?
my king.

## and now when i look around, how many of them faces do i see?
it was the bloodiest of his battles.

## typhus, of india?
i wouldn't tax yourself, your majesty.

## and then what happened?
ours is a myth only young men believe.

## where is this doctor?
get out.

## tell us who.
who?

## who do you want, alexander?
fear not.

## pray tell us, who?
it is i who love you more than any.

## what did he say?
to the best.

## why would he say crateros?
babylon, persia june 323 b. c.

## his?
a burden.

## but wasn't it really about alexander, and another population ready to obey him?
i never believed in his dream.

## what are you doing here?
oh, i couldn't wait to see you.

## how are you, old friend?
i need a new name.

## what kind of a funny hat is that?
well, look'ee here.

## don't want to get your feet dirty?
well, i'm sorry, mrs. foster.

## oh, all the way from france.
winnie foster?

## how about that?
oh, look.

## you haven't had enough killing for two lifetimes?
somebody's on to us.

## do you know about catching fireflies?
afraid not, never tried.

## strategy?
one must never announce one's presence to the prey.

## for you?
no, thank you.

## have you lived here long?
forever.

## why?
i'm... looking for some old friends who live hereabouts.

## winifred, who are you talking to out there?
i don't know.

## middlehouse?
but that's a terrible place, everyone says so.

## what in these quiet woods should be so forbidden?
winnie had always sensed a mystery waiting for her there.

## how long have you been standing there?
not long at all.

## you own these woods?
yes, i do.

## what's your name?
winifred.

## a foster?
well, i'll be.

## is that a fact?
well...

## in other words, you're lost?
you don't want that water.

## i've heard that.
not a word out of you, hear me?

## have you?
it's, it's my little music box.

## why am i here?
you have every right to be upset.

## where's the child?
she's no child...

## why do you think i brought her...?
yeah, but now she knows about us, thanks to you.

## know what?
miss foster, this is my husband, angus tuck.

## you hungry?
oh, well, let's, let's all eat.

## mmm, where's the fish?
oh, they weren't biting for some reason.

## trust her?
we can't trust her.

## and miss foster says so based on...?
her instincts.

## am i whom you're looking for?
i do believe i fit the description.

## she's gone, is she?
looks like she... ran away.

## did she now?
somehow i'm not surprised.

## may i help you off with it?
oh, honestly, i can't understand why women torture themselves this way.

## do you have a daughter?
a granddaughter.

## what happened?
they died.

## do you have brothers and sisters?
no, it's only me.

## so where do they go?
oh, they go different places, do different things.

## have you lost your way, friend?
not hardly, reverend.

## are you familiar with it?
tuck.

## tuck?
i'm afraid i can't help you.

## more time?
well, i suppose.

## reverend, are you prepared to die right now, this instant?
if it's god's will.

## you'd like that, wouldn't you?
no muss, no fuss.

## hey, winnie foster, you asleep?
not anymore.

## what?
someday.

## this is the eiffel tower?
the one in paris, it's pretty tall.

## have you really seen the real one in paris?
yes, i have.

## you doing all right?
i think so.

## do you really want to know?
yes.

## had she been there a day, a week, a month?
no.

## are you afraid of me?
no.

## well, what then?
i can't swim.

## so, you're afraid you'll drown, right?
swallow too much water, sink to the bottom and die.

## you all right?
i think so.

## you like the feeling?
i love it.

## you are looking for trouble, aren't you, mister?
yes, sir, i sure am.

## you hear that?
tuck says it's the most melancholy sound in all of nature.

## you want to spend forever with me, winnie?
i do.

## the reason you don't want anyone to find out about you?
i knew it.

## you remember when i told you i was 104 years old?
well... it's the honest truth.

## did he tell you immortality isn't all the preachers crack it up to be?
hey, leave her alone, miles.

## then tuck got bitten by a rattlesnake, and you know what?
he didn't die...... but the cat did of old age.

## do you want to stay stuck as you are right now, forever?
i've just got to make you understand.

## is that wrong?
no.

## you detect in me a playful mood?
what i have in mind is a simple, clear cut trade.

## wh what is it you want?
you want your daughter.

## done and done.
you're involved in this, aren't you?

## nice to have things legal and tidy, don't you agree?
you're an intelligent, reasonable man, mr. foster.

## what kind of horrible people must these kidnappers be?
there is evil in the world, mr. foster.

## how am i going to take you home when i can't make my feet move from this spot?
if i could die tomorrow, i'd do it... just to spend one more night with you.

## you know this man?
i met him once.

## tell me, is it a relief... to finally be discovered?
over a century of hiding out must have taken its toll on you.

## and how do you know so much about us?
i first heard about your family from my grandmother.

## what was it, now?
anna.

## i'm sure you know it, mrs. tuck?
you have no right... to come to our home... and bring us such pain.

## what is it you want?
well, you see, the fosters have given me these woods in exchange for bringing young winifred back home to them.

## cooperative?
i want you to take me to the spring.

## they're my friends.
is that so?

## if they didn't kidnap you, why on earth did that woman club that man over the head with a shotgun?
because mae tuck was protecting me.

## i'll come back for you.
who's after you?

## i have to show you the eiffel tower, don't i?
1, 652 steps to the top.

## mother?
i was just wondering what it is about these woods you love so much.

## mother, are you all right?
i'm going to miss her, too.

## got any shirts, son?
it's mo oakley's boy.

## can't be old enough to fight, can he?

## what do you call that?
i'll do that.

## and i'll never see you again?
i think there's five.

## what can i do for you?

## of?
of never recovering.

## you know when you come across one of those empty shell people?
well, there came a time in each one of those lives where they were at a crossroads.

## are you looking for a place?
yeah, i guess.

## what?
we got short term apartments.

## patti, when do i leave?
hi, i'm david.

## so, frances, why don't you stand up, and let everyone say hello?
no.

## little more vino?
excuse me.

## can a black gal get a drink?
yes, she can.

## frances, little more?
yes, i think you could say that.

## i mean, how do you begin to describe all of this?
if you have a pen, i could write it for you.

## are you a good writer?
i used to be.

## are you going to buy it?
no, no, no.

## well, who wouldn't want to buy a villa in tuscany?
but the way my life's been going that would be a terrible idea.

## don't you just love those?
shit.

## can i help you, signora?
yes, i thought the house was for sale.

## so soon?
then we asked too little.

## why?
it didn't get more valuable in five minutes.

## are you bidding against us?
wait.

## how much will she pay?
we'll see.

## is it really double the price?
i can't pay double the price.

## what did she say?
in ltaly, what happened to you is a very good sign.

## it is?
yes.

## and now... would you like to see the house?
first, we open an account.

## before the money's been transferred?
it's a house, not a vespa.

## what are you going to do, steal it?
well, i'm not there alone.

## how's the belly?
it's growing.

## did you already sign?
yes.

## are you telling me i made a mistake?
i don't know.

## did you?
it needs a little work.

## well, who's gonna do it?
i am.

## you are?
i never realized you were so handy.

## the drain in your kitchen?
no, that was me.

## the plunger?
that was tom.

## why did you just say his name?
i'm sorry.

## you know?
of course i didn't mean i was gonna do all the work myself.

## who?
the guy you're gonna meet.

## you know what?
it's starting to rain here a little bit.

## can you star 69 ltaly?
no.

## hello?
okay.

## just don't fly around, okay?
you'll freak me out.

## i'm happy to see that you were not.
signora?

## you came to check on me?
you're meeting the contractors today, and i came to help you.

## here?
downstairs.

## so, do you think it can be done?
hidden pipes, a week.

## really?
oh.

## you want to see the rest of the house?
okay.

## do you all speak english?
only me.

## what do you think of nino?
i know his mother.

## see, frances?
no.

## but never pick when it's wet, huh?
no.

## ls she okay?
of course.

## are we celebrating something in particular?
gratitude to the saints for saving us from droughts, mad dogs, and glandular disorders.

## do you like it?
i suppose it wasn't a terrible idea, buying a villa.

## no lord and master, no consort?
no.

## i knew this would happen.
do you have one?

## remember?
don't blame me.

## everything all right, darling?
this.

## who?
federico, darling.

## fellini?
he discovered me in the piazza novena with my parents eating an ice cream.

## snakes are famous for changing their minds.
did you look under the bed?

## me in this big house?
excuse me.

## this house has three bedrooms.
do you know the most surprising thing about divorce?

## and the kitchen, what if there's never anyone to cook for?
i mean, you're the stupidest woman in the world.

## why did you do it, then?
because i'm sick of being afraid all the time and because i still want things.

## see, frances?
italian is easy.

## why don't you go sit next to her?
go on.

## katherine?
come through.

## why?
i said you're boring.

## when i woke up, they were crawling all over me.
how are you ever going to be happy if you keep wallowing?

## so?
there you are.

## who are you?
i'm sorry.

## you just kissed me and you're going?
yes.

## i'm sorry?
i've already found somebody else.

## may we see your papers?
i don't know, my dear.

## have you not heard?
we hear very little and we understand even less.

## what, dear?
i've left my wallet in the hotel.

## what's been done about the murders?
my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects.

## is he in custody?
tonight he'll be at rick's.

## but can't you make it just a little more, please?
sorry, but diamonds are a drag on the market.

## will you ask rick if he'll have a drink with us?
madame, he never drinks with customers.

## what makes saloonkeepers so snobbish?
perhaps if you told him i ran the second largest bank in amsterdam.

## the second largest?
i have been in every gambling room from honolulu to berlin.

## do you know who i am?
i do.

## what makes you think i haven't?
nothing.

## may l?
too bad about those two german couriers.

## will you have a drink with me?
i forgot you never drink with i'll have another, please.

## you despise me, don't you?
if i gave you any thought, i would.

## you object to the kind of business i do, huh?
but think of all those poor refugees who must rot here if i didn't help them.

## is that so parasitic?
i don't mind a parasite.

## renault or yourself?
myself.

## you know what this is?
something that even you have never seen.

## for how long?
an hour.

## hello, ferrari.
we got trouble

## how's business at the blue parrot?
fine, but i'd like to buy your caf.

## what do you want for sam?
i don't buy or sell human beings.

## when will you realize that in this world isolationism is not a practical policy?
ferrari wants you to work for him at the blue parrot.

## where were you last night?
that's so long ago, i don't remember.

## will i see you tonight?
what a fool i was to fall for you.

## what's in lisbon?
the clipper to america.

## run off with a senator's wife?
i like to think you killed a man.

## what brought you to casablanca?
my health.

## what waters?
we're in the desert.

## again?
this is no ordinary arrest.

## what's strasser doing here?
he didn't come here to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.

## why don't you spill it?
how observant you are.

## have a brandy?
thank you.

## what's his name?
victor laszlo.

## victor laszlo?
that's the first time i've seen you impressed.

## manages what?
his escape.

## is that a serious offer?
i just paid 20.

## why two?
he is traveling with a lady.

## what ever gave you the impression that i might help laszlo escape?
because i suspect that under that cynical shell...... you're at heart a sentimentalist.

## you were saying?
excuse me.

## won't you join us?
thank you.

## will you please come with us?
certainly.

## may i first cash my chips?
very lucky.

## how do you do?
you know herr heinz of the third reich.

## do you mind if i ask a few questions?
unofficially, of course.

## what is your nationality?
i'm a drunkard.

## are you one of those who can't imagine germans in their beloved paris?
it's not particularly my beloved paris.

## can you imagine us in london?
there are sections of new york that i wouldn't advise you to try to invade.

## who will win the war?
i haven't the slightest idea.

## are my eyes really brown?
you will forgive my curiosity.

## in this case, you have no sympathy for the fox?
not particularly.

## you see, major?
you have nothing to worry about rick.

## yes, monsieur?
i reserved a table.

## your name?
berger, norwegian.

## that is your decision?
it is.

## monsieur laszlo, is it not?
yes.

## what do you want?
to welcome you to casablanca and to wish you a pleasant stay.

## may i present miss ilsa lund?
i was told you were the most beautiful woman to visit casablanca.

## won't you join us?
if you'll permit me.

## sam?
yes.

## who's he?
you are in rick's.

## is what?
mademoiselle, he's the kind of man if i were a woman...... and i weren't around, i'd be in love with rick.

## how do you do?
this is a pleasure i've looked forward to.

## is it your order we come to your office?
let us say it is my request.

## we've been in difficult places before, haven't we?
i must find out what berger knows.

## could i see it again?
very well, mademoiselle.

## how's the jewelry business?
not so good.

## we had quite a bit of excitement, right?
yes.

## where is rick?
i don't know.

## when will he be back?
not tonight no more.

## does he always leave so early?
oh, he never he's got a girl up at the blue parrot.

## this is mr. laszlo.
you've already met rick?

## how do you do?
one hears a great deal about rick in casablanca.

## a precedent is being broken.
join us for a drink?

## emil?
a very interesting caf.

## what for?
your work.

## what sort is he?
i really can't say, though i saw him quite often in paris.

## ain't you going to bed?
not right now.

## we'll get drunk and stay away till she's gone.
ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?

## shut up and go home, will you?
no, sir.

## what?
my watch stopped.

## what are you playing?
a little something of my own.

## what did you do and what did you think?
we said no questions.

## why there is no other man in my life?
that's easy.

## ten years ago?
let's see....

## where were you?
looking for a job.

## or my heart pounding?
it's the german 77th, and judging by the sound, only about 35 miles away.

## why don't we marry in marseilles?
that's too far ahead to plan.

## why not?
i love you so much.

## have you seen her?
i can't find her.

## do you hear me?
come on, mr. richard.

## why did you have to come to casablanca?
there are other places.

## how long was it we had, honey?
i didn't count the days.

## can i tell you a story, rick?
i don't know the finish yet.

## was it laszlo, or were there others in between...... or aren't you the kind that tells?
i suspect ugarte left the letters of transit with mr. blaine.

## did you rest well?
i slept well.

## may we proceed with the business?
with pleasure.

## is it possible herr laszlo will receive a visa?
i'm afraid not.

## and mademoiselle?
you needn't be concerned about me.

## is that all you wish to tell us?
don't be in a hurry.

## and that is?
you know the leader of the underground movement in paris, in prague...... in brussels, in amsterdam, in oslo, in belgrade, in athens....

## what if you murdered us all?
from every corner of europe, hundreds, thousands would rise to take our places.

## may i speak to him now?
you would find the conversation a trifle one sided.

## are you finished with us?
for the time being.

## ferrari?
it can be most helpful to know ferrari.

## and the carrying charges?
naturally, there will be a few incidental expenses.

## did i say 700 francs?
you can have it for 200.

## did you come back to tell me why you ran out on me at the station?
yes.

## why not?
i got stuck with the railway ticket.

## hiding from the police, running away all the time?
believe that if you want to.

## you mean for me to go on alone?
and only alone.

## if the situation were different...... if i had to stay and there was only one visa...... would you take it?
yes, i would.

## when i was sick in marseilles for two weeks and you were in danger...... why didn't you leave me?
i meant to.

## you know you're being shadowed?
it becomes instinct.

## have you heard about the letters of transit?
yes, something.

## you know where they are?
not for sure.

## louis, are you pro vichy or free french?
serves me right for asking a direct question.

## would you repeat it?
what i said is not your business.

## you see, captain?
the situation is not under control.

## are you certain which side you're on?
i have no conviction.

## surely the reich doesn't admit that possibility?
we're concerned about more than casablanca.

## like laszlo?
i have been thinking.

## what watch?
ten watch.

## such much?
you'll get along beautifully in america.

## how is lady luck treating you?
oh, too bad.

## how'd you get in?
you're underage.

## he is?
renault's getting broad minded.

## have a drink?
of course not.

## monsieur rick, what kind of a man is capt. renault?
he did.

## where's your husband?
at the roulette table, trying to win enough for our exit visas.

## how long have you been married?
eight weeks.

## does he know that?
yes.

## and he's still willing to give you a visa?
you want to know....

## will he keep his word?
he always has.

## you want my advice?
yes, please.

## see?
here we are again.

## could we have a table close to him?
and as far away from strasser as possible.

## do you wish to place another bet, sir?
no, i guess not.

## have you tried 22 tonight?
leave it there.

## honest?
as honest as the day is long.

## how are we doing tonight?
a couple of thousand less than i thought there would be.

## monsieur rick, may i get you a cup of coffee?
no thanks, carl.

## why interfere with my little romances?
put it down as a gesture to love.

## i wonder if i could talk to you?
go ahead.

## isn't there some other place?
it's rather confidential, what i have to say.

## isn't it strange you always seem to fight with the underdog?
i found that an expensive hobby.

## are you enough of a businessman to appreciate 100, 000 francs?
i appreciate it, but i don't accept it.

## i beg your pardon?
i said, ask your wife.

## my wife?
i'm shocked to find that gambling is going on in here.

## occupied france?
under safe conduct from me.

## of what value is that?
remember what german guarantees have been worth in the past.

## what are they?
french authorities may find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.

## the other alternative?
perhaps you have already observed that, in casablanca, human life is cheap.

## what happened with rick?
we'll discuss it later.

## or carry on the best i can?
whatever i'd say, you would carry on.

## what did you find out?
apparently he has the letters.

## yes?
but he won't sell them.

## did he give you any reason?
he suggested i ask you.

## ask me?
yes.

## when i was in the concentration camp...... were you lonely in paris?
yes, victor.

## is there anything you wish to tell me?
no, victor.

## yes, dear?
be careful.

## how long can i afford to stay closed?
two weeks, maybe three.

## you finish locking up, will you?
i will.

## how did you get in?
the stairs from the street.

## won't you sit down?
richard, i had to see you.

## your visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit?
as long as i have them, i'll never be lonely.

## do i have to hear again how great your husband is...... what an important cause he's fighting for?
it was your cause too.

## you want to feel sorry for yourself?
with so much at stake, all you can think of is your own feeling.

## what of it?
i'm gonna die in casablanca.

## and then?
it wasn't long after we were married that victor went back to czechoslovakia.

## why keep your marriage a secret?
it wasn't my secret, richard.

## when did you first find out he was alive?
just before you and i were to leave paris.

## now?
i don't know.

## you'll help him now, won't you?
you'll see that he gets out.

## carl, what happened?
the police break up our meeting.

## had a close one?
yes, rather.

## don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this?
i mean, what you're fighting for.

## what of it?
then it'll be out of its misery.

## you know how you sound?
like a man who's convincing himself of something he doesn't believe.

## you love her that much?
apparently, you think of me only as the leader of a cause.

## yes?
come with us.

## on what charge?
because, one, you bet 10, 000 francs he'd escape.

## what friend?
ilsa lund.

## why do you still care what happens to laszlo?
i'm not.

## why do you think we want to hold you?
ilsa is laszlo's wife.

## how do i know you'll keep your bargain?
i'll make the arrangements with laszlo in the visitor's pen.

## should we draw it up, or is a handshake good enough?
certainly not good enough.

## is everything ready?
i have the letters here.

## when we searched the place, where were they?
sam's piano.

## haven't you told him?
not yet.

## but it's all right, isn't it?
everything's quite all right.

## you won't have trouble in lisbon?
no.

## you're surprised about ricky?
the explanation is simple.

## have you taken leave of your senses?
i have.

## i wonder if you realize what this means?
i do.

## hello? ls that the airport?
capt. renault speaking.

## hello, radio tower?
lisbon plane taking off in 10 minutes, east runway.

## you think of everything, don't you?
the names are mr. and mrs. victor laszlo.

## but...... why my name?
you're getting on that plane.

## but what about you?
i'm staying here till the plane gets away.

## what's happened to you?
last night we said a great many things.

## do you know what you'd have to look forward to here?
we'd both wind up in a concentration camp.

## isn't that true?
maj. strasser would insist.

## but what about us?
we'll always have paris.

## isn't that true?
yes.

## are you ready?
yes, i'm ready.

## what was the meaning of that phone call?
victor laszlo is on that plane.

## why not stop him?
ask monsieur rick.

## my letter of transit?
i could use a trip.

## did you translate the markings?
it's a slav dialect.

## so, what should we say in terms of resale value?
i am not interested in the resale.

## we turn a profit, do we not?
i will keep what i wish.

## will you be needing anything?
no, no, no.

## why not, solina?
one reason.

## where was that rule a month ago?
it's new.

## this is this it?
garage sale.

## hello?
ohh.

## what have they found?
furniture, candlesticks... some old piece of shit pottery.

## what about artwork or diamonds or gold?
fucking crucifixes and coffee cups.

## you really sure we want to do do this?
if it's worth locking, it's worth taking.

## what... the hell is that?
she said money.

## fucking thousand year old silverware?
probably got his goddamn mother in that thing.

## if you make a killing, why hide it in a safe...
marcus?

## this look like an old wood box to you guys?
the holy grail, the golden fleece... the crown fucking jewels, whatever it is, it's inside.

## right.
you want to get paid?

## why do you build this?
all right, you guys.

## i just won't let it get to me.
what are you looking at?

## so, what do you think it is?
you tell me.

## what?
nothing.

## what happened?
we were robbed, simon.

## what did they take?
my private holdings.

## why aren't they all over?
there's no need to inform the police.

## where are you going?
well, i must tend to this matter myself.

## matthew, what did they take?
matthew.

## a father?
ha ha.

## so, how long to the caymans?
we're under an hour.

## what the hell is going on?
you know something.

## would you just go sit down?
just sit down.

## what?
oh, man.

## shade?
shade, quit fucking around.

## shade, you back there?
it was probably just turbulence.

## what the hell are you?
oh, my god.

## marcus?
uhh.

## mary?
mary, wake up.

## who?
mary.

## why are you asking me this?
she was afraid of something.

## do i have some terrible secret?
her confession would've been confidential.

## remember?
we went to school together.

## the tits?
it's the talent that matters, val.

## i screwed up, didn't i?
didn't even notice.

## now we lost the sun, didn't we?
i have to go out.

## where?
oh, just...

## what are you doing?
what must be done.

## what are you doing?
fuck.

## oh, mr. van helsing, haven't you been selfish?
jesus.

## who the hell was that?
he meant to kill us.

## why?
that was solina.

## you understand?
shoot it in the heart or cut off its head.

## you understand?
they are the undead.

## i'm an atheist.
the undead?

## huh?
god loves you anyway.

## oh, ah... you know why you never had me, simon?
finish her, simon.

## they are nosferatu vampires.
won't you have a lot to explain?

## and you're all right with this?
i had them destroyed, eradicated... all but one my secret in the abbey.

## who?
dracula... not myth... no ravings of a mad irish novelist.

## what do you mean, can't?
for each act that destroys a vampire... he survives.

## he is, quite simply... beyond the reach of death, but why?
that is the question that has plagued me... for over a century.

## who is this creature that walks as a man... yet casts no reflection?
i made a promise a long time ago... that if dracula could not die, then nor would i.

## matthew, abraham, whoever you are... what else have you never told me?
for the first time, i believe... that there is someone else in the world like him... and he senses it.

## how did you feel?
scared, but a little bit drawn.

## do you have a sense of that?
he wants me.

## do you understand me, mary?
you've got to fight back.

## well, what if i can't?
i'm sorry.

## now, how does one become a vampire, solina?
no.

## how does one become a lover?
well, i don't know.

## whoa.
you see that?

## can i help you?
i'm here for mary.

## mary?
she's...

## mare?
no luck.

## you want to come in?
you can wait.

## oh, what's the word?
catholic.

## hey, can i get you some coffee or something?
i don't drink... coffee.

## why don't you make yourself comfortable?
i'll be right back down.

## yes, lucy?
i was named after the peanuts character.

## have you seen her?
she cut out early.

## problem?
oh, no problem.

## mary heller?
my name's simon sheppard.

## is there somewhere we could speak?
my father and i have not had contact in over 12 years.

## she never told you the reason, did she?
i saw what it did to her.

## buy a brother a drink?
sorry, mate.

## never, ever fuck with an antiques dealer.
how's this for a concept?

## mary?
if you harm my daughter...

## hello?
hey, mare.

## where are you?
i'm with your father.

## what did you say?
ahh...

## father?
my unholy addiction has corrupted mary's blood...

## you knew about this?
not until tonight.

## so, what now, simon?
we need a sacred place.

## it's what all this is about, isn't it?
i'm his.

## why are you doing this?
well, let's just say...

## fate?
your father kept us all safe from this evil... for a hundred years.

## father kept him locked up in some kind of dungeon?
he tried to keep him from the world, mary... but most of all, he tried to keep him from you.

## why silver?
it's not uniquely christian.

## is that hebrew?
aramaic.

## aramaic?
that's been a dead language for almost 2, 000 years.

## you know aramaic?
no, but he does.

## simon?
mary's his.

## who are you?
i can't die.

## he still loves you.
did you ever ask?

## how fast?
4:32.

## or did your lips just slip?
it's not that i didn't like it but i don't know what to think anymore.

## is it clearer now?
yep.

## how many are there?
pizza cops.

## oil?
yeah, it's my apartment but it's also kind of a garage.

## yes?
we've known each other for two years now.

## why did you wait until the day you quit to show me your apartment?
i take a long time to decide.

## and what made you decide?
your cleavage.

## it's nice, eh?
the dress is brand new.

## are you sure it's okay after all these years of friendship?
we prepared the ground well, it's time to build on it.

## what?
it's 6 o'clock.

## you just stopped working last night, you didn't find a job during the night, did you?
no, it's for my future job...... a kind of meeting i booked a long time ago.

## how long have you been a driver?
25 years yesterday.

## that's all?
yes.

## you want me to sing the national anthem?
yes.

## huh?
i use super unleaded.

## still wearing the moustache!?
go, paulo.

## hey girls, going to the beach?
today it's free.

## coming?
the driver is really nice.

## you see the pink house over there, with a big door?
yes, i see it.

## do you prefer a route in particular?
put all that in the kitchen, i'll organise it later.

## he eats all that in one meal?
no.

## can't you tell right from left?
yes but you should have told me sooner.

## everyone has their strengths.
should i have sent a sax?

## in a circus, in a zoo, the government or what?
a little bit of all three.

## should i have sent a fax?
excuse me.

## can i offer you something, inspector?
thank you, that's great.

## i don't want to be rude but i need to go work, is it ok if i eat in the taxi?
i didn't have the time it was too fast.

## do you think we're going to make it on time?
because if we're going to miss it maybe we should take our time.

## how did you do?
i didn't make it.

## what happened?
nothing, i just crashed into a butcher shop.

## you know what?
you should put a mouse in your car, instead of your steering wheel.

## what?
come on...

## 140?
yeah of course, they called in the air force.

## hey, have you heard this one?
listen, it's funny.

## what's the difference between a comb and a moron?

## how is that possible?
i'm going to be late.

## that depends, who you are looking for?

from the bar owner just in front of us.

## when a driver isn't driving, he's in the garage.
oh yeah?

## what are they doing there?
it's a miracle!

## where are you going?
after observation, action.

## me?
sleeping.

my boss will love that.

## it's possible, isn't it?
a man that works all week and then isn't around on sunday.

## do you think it's reasonable?
i'm really sorry, lily.

## we're going to wait all day in front of the garage again?
observation is finished, now comes questioning.

no.

## which one of you is called kruger, please?

## who could it be?
leave it, they'll probably go.

## where were we?
i was kissing you.

## how?
i don't know... the cops...

## you didn't kill anybody?
no.

## daniel, who's that dwarf?
a friend.

## playing with smurfs now?

## you've got a friend in the police?
not a real friend,...

## right, and the old lady is mata hari.
you work for the cops?

## can someone explain this to her?
i can't do it.

i...

## welcome to deadwood.
is it any wonder that i couldn't face reality?

## is she allowed to say that?
come on.

## have you ever seen sidarthur in person?
no, but i think stu wolff is the greatest poet since shakespeare.

## my father is stu wolff's lawyer.
you do?

## really?
your dad must have been in the same room as him and everything.

## aren't you the girl who just moved into the swenska house?
well, i'm lola steppe.

## is that supposed to be that famous new york sense of humor?
new yorkers learn to laugh at themselves and everything else when they're very young.

## yes?
we have a new girl from new york city.

## she doesn't really have your potential, now, does she?
look at her.

## and what about those glasses?
oh, no, that's fine.

## so what's with the great santini?
she's beautiful.

## who's that guy smiling at us?
that's sam.

## it's your first day here, right?
yeah.

## why doesn't your mother like me?
she likes you.

## not important?
she's the woman who gave me life.

## ironic, isn't it?
your parents think my mother is the destroyer of our social order.

## what?
nothing.

## not stick to the exquisite words of mr. george bernard shaw?
we're not english, and this isn't the 19th century, so i think we should adapt the classics to reflect our times.

## you're gonna be playing eliza?
well, of course.

## that's gonna give the play new resonance and immediacy for today.
was carla santini going to stand in the way of that birth?

## you mean it was your idea?
yes, lola, it's my idea.

## then how are we to proceed?
i guess i'll try, of course.

## why had i been so certain i was going to get the lead?
miss baggoli didn't say anything encouraging.

## is that a threat?
you heard it here first.

## what?
i can't breathe.

## can you believe this?
one of the most catastrophic events in the history of the universe has occurred, and everyone's acting as if nothing has happened.

## so, who's next?
me.

## are you crazy?
carla's the all time champion.

## so?
there's gonna be a new all time champion.

## oh, really?
what he told me isn't available to the public yet.

## and guess who already has an invitation?
it just so happens that ella and i do.

## oh, really?
yeah, really.

## how'd you manage that?
same way you did.

## what connections do you have other than the phone?
well, on whether we go.

## in new york?
and the party.

## are you partially insane?
you know, we have to go.

## is there something wrong with the salmon?
no, just not very hungry.

## how can you treat me like this?
i was your firstborn.

## what did ella's mother say?
she didn't ask her.

## hello?
om.

## hello?
yeah.

## okay, how about this?
daddy drops you off at the concert and picks you up after.

## is there no end to the humiliation you want to heap upon me, mom?
we're heaping humiliation.

## is mary going to die?
she's not gonna die.

## what is that smell?
okay.

## can't you take it away next month or september?
no.

## so, did you get yours yet?
actually, mine came in the mail yesterday, but i'm nice enough not to flaunt them.

## why don't you admit you don't have tickets or an invite and get it over with?
i'm sure there's gonna be a lot of photographers there.

## really?
i guess.

## you sure we have enough?
hi.

## so, do you think you could look absolutely perfect in something that you already own?
sure, i'll try and find something.

## yeah, they love us, right?
they really love us.

## wait here one second, okay?
don't cry.

## you must see these sidarthur people?
it's their last performance.

## well, why didn't you just ask, pumpkin?
i didn't know i could.

## i mean, what does one wear to stu wolff's party?
there's gonna be so many famous people there.

## i know it's not like me to be unprofessional, but how can i concentrate when sam is risking his life for me?
oof.

## lola and carla, do you have to talk?
that's odd.

## why isn't this locked?
oh, my goodness.

## well, i have no idea, do l?
you know, i just want to talk to you about my lines.

## you don't know your lines?
at this time, i don't even want to discuss this.

## you know what i think?
i've never really relaxed before.

## trying?
take a look under the hood.

## are you kidding me?
hurry, i don't want to miss the train.

## you mean you asked if it was okay?
borrowed it.

## you take the money, okay?
okay.

## you have your tickets and your money?
we have the money.

## isn't there a stall or something?
no.

## what's wrong?
ella, it's not here.

## when did you last see it?
in the train.

## you mean sneak in?
sneaking would be beneath us, but i can't think of a better word for what we're about to do.

## this is a little tricky, so just follow my lead, okay?
i wonder what song they'll do.

## can i have another look at your ticket, please?
right.

## yeah?
you can see him outside.

## and miss the concert?
yeah, i don't think so.

## ella, what are you doing?
i'm going back to the hotel.

## what if everyone gave up, ella?
there'd be no america, no electricity, no tivo.

## don't you want to see the look on carla's face when we show up at that party?
yeah, i do.

## where in soho?
we don't even know where stu lives.

## a picture of a door?
it's not just a door.

## ready?
yeah.

## ready?
your mom called.

## so, where are you going?
to a party.

## can't you wait outside or something?
right outside.

## and could you lay low?
you're scaring my friend.

## so, are you ready to have fun?
i hope so.

## dr. and mrs. lawrence?
yeah.

## could i just use your phone?
i have to call my parents.

## don't you remember?
it's over.

## yeah, remember?
he's been trouble all over the world.

## would you please relax?
i'd rather lose him than lose my life.

## where do you think he's going?
someplace great.

## this for you is great?
i'm getting really scared being out here all alone, lola.

## what?
come with me.

## do you believe how lucky we are?
i almost hear them praying that we don't sit near them.

## do you think anybody really knows who i am?
i don't even know who i am.

## do you think i have any real friends?
we'll just have coffee.

## is that too difficult?
you two better keep him in line.

## stu, do you have any cash on you?
we sort of left ours on the train.

## can you believe this?
we're actually having coffee with stu wolff.

## who are you?
the fates have sort of brought us together.

## ella what?
ella gerard.

## you?
lola steppe.

## why did you lie like that to the police?
they're gonna find out that your father is dead.

## i'm resigned to what life may bring, but why did you give a false address?
you know, ella, i think your true soul and spirit are finally beginning to emerge.

## why did you lie?
i didn't lie.

## a little?
exaggerating a little is saying you're a little taller.

## can we talk about this later?
we should tell stu what happened first.

## when?
i had a reason.

## the truth?
just give me a moment.

## more interesting?
we are 1, 000 miles from home in a new york police station with a drunken rock star waiting for your dead father to show up.

if somebody wants you to know.

## i know it is, but what do you think about that?
i don't think that wearing pink... indicates your sexual orientation necessarily.

## did you guys see the cover story on the oregonian about the gay rams?
yeah.

## but the scary thing is if they know what causes homosexuality... is that something you could change, something you could remove?
there's all this weird political stuff around it.

## how in the world do we know their spirit?
if they wear one of those bracelets, the rainbow and stuff, that's a giver.

## then why would it even matter?
you're wearing a bracelet and you're not gay.

we'll go, just drive 15 under the speed limit.

## we'll understand?
i just want to live to get my license.

## where it sticks out above your belt?
and you can't get rid of it, no matter what.

## what's up?
you suck.

## what's that smell?
that's just your mom.

## want more of these?
no thanks.

## what was that?
i don't know.

## this was made in germany, right?
yeah.

## can you still buy nazi flags?
sure, if you're a nut.

## that's hitler, right?
yeah.... who fears the intellect and hates all intellectuals.

## hey, how you doing?
you guys must be out of school today.

## and you?
good.

## what are you doing?
just taking pictures.

## can i take a picture of you?
nice.

## you going to the concert tonight?
no, my parents are being bitches.

## have you?
i don't appreciate you putting signs out like that.

## so, we'll park here, right?
we'll enter through the south entrance.

## we'll gear up there, we'll hear the primary explosions... go about here in the cafeteria, right?
when that goes, we should be able to pick off kids... as we traverse the east wing.

## what are you guys doing?
get the fuck out and don't come back.

## dude, what the fuck?
don't worry about it, it's probably just slow.

## are you sure you set it right?
positive.

## what was that?
sounded like bombs.

## what the hell is wrong with you?
okay, then be a bitch.

## what was that?
firecracker.

## nate?
come on, get up, nate.

## why are you doing this?
eric, put the gun down.

## yeah, what's going on?
i saw two guys come in the other side.

## where did you go?
i just...

## so how did you do?
did all right.

## what happened?
i shot the principal and some other people, and...

## why don't you handle this one, grace?
it's time i gave you more responsibility on the farm.

## really?
thanks, mrs. c. i'll make you proud.

## we're sorry, mrs. caloway.
you don't get this whole farm concept, do you, sister?

## why can't you?
uh, no, not really.

## everybody?
this here is maggie.

## on patch of heaven?
now, i want y'all to make her feel right at home.

## you hear me?
hey, thanks, everybody.

## is this thing on?
ahem.

## what?
no.

## but who would eat a chicken?
heh heh.

## what could we do?
ohh...

## uh, what is?
listen.

## what would you say if i told you... that you could win big money... and see beautiful downtown chugwater... if you went to the county fair?
ohh.

## tense.
what do you say, caloway?

## what's her specialty, sour cream?
going to town.

## ladies?
mrs. c.

## well, what made you change your mind?
i'd rather not talk about it.

## maggie, may i be frank?
well, think again.

## who put this here?
oh, buck, this ain't no dodge city... but we get our share of excitement.

## what you got there?
hmm.

## you hear that, rusty?
yeah, rico.

## boy, wouldn't that be the life?
whoo!

## what keeps the people from roaming?
they appear to be domesticated.

## ohh.
what was that?

## what kind of sheriff's office is that?
if that's the sheriff's office, this town rocks.

## you girls a little far from home, aren't ya?
well, if it isn't the phony express.

## what is that?
i believe you left this on our farm.

## hmm, i'd say...
don't you heifers get it?

## but, maggie, where are we gonna get all that money?
well, maybe maggie can just pull it out of her ear.

## who is that?
shh.

## don't you know a hero when you see one, huh?
oh, that is a sensible idea.

## let me think.
don't they have sarcasm where you come from?

## real fast?
kinda.

## why?
because i don't like it.

## what?
it's a farm auction, ladies.

## what's going to happen to the cow who lived there?
she'll be ok.

## this was your farm?
mm hmm.

## what happened?
alameda slim happened.

## mmm?
ohh...

## huh?
just ignore them, and perhaps they'll go away.

## hmm?
look, lover bull, we're here strictly on business.

## what kind of business?
we're looking for a cattle rustler named alameda slim.

## what was that?
it must be slim and the willies.

## slim and the willies?
i'll protect you.

## with what?
howdy, slim.

## you boys see anything before i got here?
yeah, we sure did there, rico.

## you guys ok?
i don't know.

## singing?
that didn't sound like singing to me.

## you boys headed back to town?
yes, sir.

## machine?
well, there it is, then.

## hey, watch it.
why don't i?

## where are you going, hotfoot?
i'm gonna go nab that rustler... and show rico i got what it takes... so say good bye to your farm, girls, because slim is mine.

## how can we compete with that?
look at the bright side, mrs. c.

## who better to catch a cattle thief than a cow?
yeah, even you can't argue with that kind of logic.

## how about a song?
i'm gonna get you for this.

## what?
thank you.

## big mike donald had a farm?
put up your dukes, mr. fancy britches.

## hello?
this here is the disguise i use... to sneak into all them auctions... and buy all the land, you brainless monotone monkeys.

## my singing?
songbirds sing.

## hmm?
why, it's one of the funniest, cornball, goofy, silly sounds... in the whole west.

## but it's just a little old dirt farm.
what?

## ah, what's the difference?
when you're talking revenge, every last acre counts.

## daddy, what's going to happen if they don't come back?
oh, but they are coming back.

## it doesn't take a cow to figure out... they saw the writing on the wall... and flown the coop while the getting was good.
what?

## excuse me!
what?

## audrey, remember when grace helped you figure out... why you crossed the road?
and, jeb, miss caloway knew just what to do... when your head got stuck in that spittoon.

## what trail?
i can't see anything.

## but what about catching slim and collecting the reward?
we never had a prayer... of catching slim in the first place.

## what's that supposed to mean?
strutting around with your vulgar show cow behavior.

## will the sun ever shine again?
mmm...

## where will you go?
oh, probably check out the grand canyon.

## where's grace?
hi, there.

## where did all this come from?
hey, it's green, it's leafy, and it's free.

## now, where was i?
without a doubt.

## maggie, what are you thinking?
look, i got a score to settle with that rhinestone fat boy... and nothing to lose.

## deal?
your powers of persuasion are uncanny.

## can't you stupid sack of hammers get it right?
oh, the ever punctual mr. weaseley.

## so, slim, what do you say we get a move on... and load these cash cows onto the train a. s. a. p., huh?
let's go.

## how come they got to go through?
buck...

## so what's the plan?
well, let's see...

## why?
listen, i came to warn you, one equine to another, about rico.

## 4, 337...
have you seen that guy?

## can't you morons count to yourselves?
come on.

## what do we got?
4, 997.

## wait, wait, what?
i thought you said 5, 000 even.

## ahem.
huh?

## what's the deal, slimbo?
maybe she wasn't an art lover.

## mother of mercy.
huh?

## is this the end of rico?
uh... ha...

## the whole territory belongs to me.
how are we supposed to drive that thing?

## huh?
five cents for these chicks.

## what?
uh...

## where's maggie?
i can't believe she just left.

## she risked her life for us, and who are we but strangers?
we were privileged to know her.

## well, it's your call, caloway.
how about forever?

## is this barnyard big enough for the both of us?
full house.

## sure you don't want me to wait?
no, thanks.

## how could i have forgotten?

## after two years of training... you believe that a $45, 000 airplane... is there for your amusement?
no, sir.

## honing your skills?
that's not training, mccawley.

## how could that be, when you're famous... for being the first man in the world ever to do it?
don't get cute with me, son.

## a what?
an homage, sir.

## sir?

## say, fella, are you enlisted?
yeah.

## just like this?
that's fine.

## why'd you do it?
i mean, i'm just curious.

## you know what?
i think you hit the bone there.

## what?
so is is there any chance... that you might, kind of, sort of... you know, like me, or...

## oh, how did you guess?
they never taught us... how to deal with this... feeling.

## wh what feeling?
well, it's kind of like... this.

## what did he mean?
like you.

## have you already had this shot?
yeah, well, once... already.

## what'd you do to him?
poor guy.

## are you ok?
uh, yeah.

## celebrate what?
oh, i don't know.

## why not?
so, uh, ahem...

## what's in your other hand?
mine.

## would you happen to have any friends?
huh.

## your last name's strange?
yeah.

## do you always stutter?
no.

## nervous?
yeah.

## why can't i get something like that?
hello.

## so, i mean, you never know what might happen tomorrow... or... or any day after that, you know?
so...

## why are you crying?
i guess it's the thought... that i might not ever get to see you again.

## are you gonna be a bad influence?
of course i'm a bad influence.

## would you like that?
we'll be dressing for cocktails and walk into the grandsalon.

## actually, you know what?
this is better.

## well, the future's not exactly in our hands, is it?
that was not part of the date.

## how could they order you to go?
they didn't order me.

## and now you volunteer... for the most dangerous place you could go?
it's not your responsibility, not your choice.

## don't, um... could you... not come see me off?
because, uh... saying good bye to you once is hard enough.

## you think it looks good on me?
i will come back.

## why you looking for her then?
it's my test.

## you just make sure and come back for the both of us, all right?
ok.

## are all yanks as anxious as you... to get themselves killed, pilot officer?
not anxious to die, sir.

## send the brits and russians more of our ships... and anti aircraft weapons.
how long is america going to pretend... the world is not at war?

## what choice do we have?
we're building refrigerators while our enemies build bombs.

## how many sailors per ship?
it depends.

## but say, on average... 2, 000?
then there's the flyers, the marines, base personnel.

## gooz, what in the hell are you doing?
just trying to fix this surfboard thing.

## yeah?
well, you're gonna need a broom.

## y'all pilots?
we're working on it.

## who are you?
terrors of the skies.

## family?
girl, sir.

## don't they know what we're facing out here?
they feel europe is the greater danger.

## i'm assuming these risk assessments include hawaii?
pearl harbor is too shallow for an aerial torpedo attack.

## you analysts got it all figured out, don't you?
the smart enemy hits you... exactly where you think you're safe.

## what do you mean, sweetie?
when i'm up there getting my slate wiped clean...

## could you be any more boring?
don't bother.

## you wanna come for a ride?
come on.

## all right, walker, who you got?
i'll take the cook.

## done.
why?

## against a mechanic?
that guy craps rivets.

## how's it feel up from the engine room?
ow.

## bleeding?
that's a scratch.

## see this?
boxing.

## did you win?
yes, ma'am.

## what do you get for winning?
respect.

## so, why do you have to fight with your fists to get respect?
i left my momma in texas... and joined the navy to see the world... become a man.

## volunteered?
he... he told me he'd been assigned.

## but you know what?
i look at myself in the mirror in this uniform... and i still don't know who i am.

## hey, danny... how'd you like to go flying?
come here.

## what destiny, to live like a crab in a shell?
we live well.

## but how can we, when every harbor is an enemy's?
oh, i'm sick of your crazy dreams.

## ... but to excel at swordplay and boxing?
yes, sire.

## do the gods approve the day and the hour?
the omens are good and also the prophecies, with but one exception.

## how can i, mother?
oh, i wish it hadn't been given me...... this agony i live with.

## elysium?
far from it.

## what's the matter?
oh, just a quickening of the breeze.

## what?
some ship had bad luck.

## who?
the fairest goddess.

## what was your ship?
cover him up, quickly.

## yes.
a man, my lady?

## what if he's a warrior and only pretending?
you must be careful.

## to whom am i indebted for this gallant defense?
nobody of importance.

## did i mention that?
my memory is clouded.

## you're addressing a slave of the palace, andros.
you're a bit impudent yourself for whatever you are, a slave?

## of what importance is that?
i tell you truly, i am prince paris.

## and why should that worry you?
never mind.

## do you know her?
she owns me.

## not even the king?
great power doesn't need knowledge.

## so you still hope i won't go to the palace?
more than ever.

## when will they be in council?
tomorrow, perhaps.

## see what i brought you?
my dear little slave girl...... i don't want what you steal from the palace.

## don't you believe i could love a slave?
yes, i believe.

## are you sure ulysses is coming?
his ship was not far behind mine.

## paris is anyone's equal with a cestus, bow and javelin.
you think the trojans built a citadel for peace lovers?

## you believe they want peace?
yes.

## lead us, achilles?
of course.

## who?
i, ajax.

## you are king menelaus?
yes.

## how'd you know we were here?
i beg my lord's indulgence, i know.

## troy does not plan war?
you are wrong, menelaus.

## where'd you find this impostor?
he came to the palace.

## what do you do besides this royal imposture?
it seems i try to do the impossible.

## you heard, ajax, achilles?
achilles is weary from travel.

## if i come fairly out of this fight, will you believe that i am paris...... and hear the trojan peace terms?
if your head's still on your shoulders, yes.

## to study our arts and culture?
the man can neither speak nor hear.

## what did you think of the trojan?
you saw what i thought.

## what is this game you're playing?
i might do many things with him.

## why did you marry him?
when a king takes spoils, he robs no one.

## the queen's handmaiden, eh?
the king commands me to entertain his guests.

## a fine greek custom, but guest?
he's in a prison, if he only knew it.

## must king menelaus command you himself to admit me?
the royal temper's already running a fever.

## shall i tell the king you said that?
get to your business, you little troublemaker.

## those two soldiers on watch down there...... are they going to help me too?
you're a captive.

## then what chance have i?
a cup of wine.

## does he think the man will swim?
he'd be deep in the forest by now.

## why do you wait?
it was just a foolish hope.

## here?
she sent you garments...... arranged for a phoenician ship to take you home.

## what more, trojan?
i didn't really expect her to come.

## you made clear to adelphus what i said?
he is far off by this time.

## and destroy the hope of peace you were taking home with you?
no.

## and always young, paris, remember?
what is remembered is forever young.

## ulysses, why do you sit?
menelaus, we will reclaim her, and with her, all the loot of troy.

## leader?
i'll see no one but achilles as leader.

## who are they?
i don't know, but i know the color of their gold.

## what will they call us there?
a woman who left her husband.

## what else can we ever be?
two people in love.

## you know the island of pelagos?
it's far southward...

## yes?
we have decided otherwise.

## what is it?
you'll have to see, lord aeneas.

## how could one so tender have managed it?
postpone your questions.

## by what name, my lady, shall we know you?
my name is her name is death.

## you were going to say?
i am helen, queen of sparta.

## the wife of king menelaus?
his wife no more.

## and what have you brought?
dishonor.

## you reject every word of wisdom?
my love has no logic.

## the coward's way to avoid the fight?
you exceed the rights of a brother.

## pelagos?
go home and search your hearts, trojans...... for all this must be answered soon.

## without you?
i've gained a victory of a sort tonight.

## here?
oh, yes, even here.

## what shall we pay?
aeneas, bring them here.

## see what you have brought upon us?
father.

## hector, where is my place?
beside your spartan woman.

## no trojans to greet us?
i had hoped they'd be foolish enough to scatter their forces.

## camp?
no, onwards.

## against troy's walls, achilles?
she's mine.

## the girl you fell in love with?
always keep that image with you, paris.

## then it can't be lost, can it?
what has been lived and shared is never lost.

## but if you should lose me...... could you resign yourself to that?
don't worry, nothing will happen to you.

## to our island, paris?
oh, goddess come to earth, make me immortal with your kiss...... and we'll live on nectar and ambrosia.

## how many years, fellow trojans, shall we suffer?
our only respite, a truce to burn our dead.

## how long will they accuse me?
they lost many loved ones, my lady.

## how, then, could i blame you for this war?
i could stop it.

## go back to someone you so despise?
if it brings an end to war and restores paris to the love of the trojans....

## and could i ever leave him?
you must help me to decide.

## would you defy the fates?
no mortal should attempt so much, helen.

## lovely?
no.

## you hear that, brother?
i've heard it often.

## with helen returned, integrity satisfied?
you are too outspoken, brother.

## helen?
helen.

## where is she?
she's not here, paris.

## where?
she's gone to the camp of the greeks.

## to menelaus?
she was determined to end the destruction...... and restore you to the hearts of the trojans.

## debt?
we recognize no claim of debt.

## then who pays for the greek blood shed on this plain?
trojan blood has paid in full.

## what more can you tell us?
new storms shall ride the sky...... but the guilt will be athena's, not helen's.

## where is hector and andromache?
they are to bestow the laurels.

## where is hector?
by the scaean gates, sire.

## achilles?
by his hand, my father and my brothers fell.

## what are you dreaming, ulysses?
i'm dreaming of my wife, the good, constant penelope.

## has this anything to do with the work...... that apagos and his men have been doing in the woodlands?
they're building a monument to the triumph of paris and helen.

## are you sure the trojans will take this monstrosity into the city?
i promise.

## aboard the ships?
we'll soon know.

## what was that for?
athena.

## are you jealous, aphrodite?
i'm only helen...... who wonders if she'll ever be a trojan, really.

## when the trojan people look upon that plain...... won't they always think of helen of sparta?
there is peace everywhere now.

## or i?
obey your king.

## i know that you see things, and i know that people don't believe you, but i do.
cassandra, have you just had one of your visions, hmm?

## what else?
if he lives, troy will burn.

i knew guys like bret at your age.

## mom, i'm not you, okay?
i'm not gonna get pregnant at 1 6.

## i'm sorry, okay?
i'm really sorry.

## be careful with it, all right?
okay.

## sam...... before i left...
i was wondering if your mom was home?

## hook up?
not hook up.

## i mean, meet somewhere and catch up on things?
sure, chris.

## joshua?
there's no sign of joshua...... his parrot...... or any of the arachnids.

## leon, is this the section he was working on when he died?
i thought so.

## can you give me a ride into town?
sure.

## what's that?
i think it's an exoskeleton of a male orb weaver's pedipalps.

## do you really want to know?
try me.

## so...... where were you?
i went to joshua's.

## and no tv.
what did i say about that?

## i know, i thought it was a slam dunk. who knew chris mccormack would suddenly get gold fever?
i'm trying my best here.

## might steal a car, want one?
bret, i'm on the phone.

## what the...?
good lord.

## what is that? what are they looking for?
that's just wrong.

## aunt gladys, how can you listen to this wacko?
i think he's very informative.

## do floyd and leroy still have that barbershop?
good idea.

## you can't light those matches?
four bucks.

## four bucks?
it's a good deal.

## i don't want to lose my virginity in the front seat of a truck. why didn't you say so?
i got a blanket in the back.

## i'm warning you, okay?
i can't believe my mom was right about you.

## do you have any idea how embarrassing that is?
we gotta go.

## what the hell are these things?
here we go again.

## bruiser?
oh, my god.

## aunt gladys, i lost the face fuzz.
are you in there?

## aunt gladys?
i can't explain now.

## what's going on?
so check this out.

## the hole in the basement was bigger. what hole?
let's input the measurements from your exoskeleton and see what happens.

## what the hell is this?
it's my media induced nightmare.

## so you're telling me a giant spider ate gladys?
maybe not.

## was there webbing around?
yeah, lots of it.

## she might have been attacked by a male orb weaver. what's the difference?
males compete for the female by bringing her presents.

## hold on to your shirt.
so gladys might still be alive?

## is that you, sam?
i don't know what's going on, but the phones are down.

## i'm closing up.
guns?

## you're always talking at me about something. can you turn that thing down?
first emma leaves, now sam's got me doing spring cleaning. can't get any worse.

## so, what happened with you and brian anyway?
he wasn't exactly the faithful type.

## ashley, mike, you guys ready?
just a minute, mom.

## how many spiders did joshua have?
i don't know.

## are you kidding me?
it's pete.

## what are you doing?
i need to make a broadcast.

## did she just say giant spiders?
that's just harlan's show.

## why didn't someone say something?
look at me.

## mom, are you there?
yeah, mike.

## why the mall?
help yourself, sweetie.

## kind of slow today, huh?
it's always slow here, wade.

## you happy?
no.

## how do you lower the gate?
key.

## do you have it?
spider, man.

## how's the lock down holding?
this one's pretty good.

## bob miller, my best customer, was hanging from my ceiling. what am i doing on the radio?
i've been telling you about the invasion for months.

## am i talking to myself?
i'm here for you.

## you saying those things are aliens?
you're not listening...

## where have you been, wade?
the phones are dead.

## does anyone have a cell phone?
use mine.

## norman?
show me the way to the roof.

## how's it looking?
roof's clear.

## perfume?
spiders have a developed sense of smell.

## come on.
nobody is dying, okay?

## you have the phone?
i thought you did.

## i have to find wade.
now, how about dialing?

## has anyone seen wade?
he went through a door back there.

## between the sewing center and the cinemaplex?
he must have locked it. we're trapped.

## i'll try to lead them away.
heights?

## you'll what?
defend the human race.

## you know what?
let's just go back inside.

## plan b?
i tell you what. we're just gonna run away.

## yeah?
okay.

## what are you doing here?
i can't find my way out.

## down here?
just chilling.

## mom?
ashley.

## can you lead these people out of here?
i don't know.

## that spider back there, was that the female?
no.

## so she's probably still close by, right?
mom sent me.

## why?
you don't want to know.

## what is it?
i think it's alive.

## bret, just go, okay?
it looks like an orb weaver den.

## is there a chance that gladys is still alive?
it's possible.

## are you crazy?
you'll have to get out without me.

## what are you up to?
i got an idea.

## my bike?
just do it.

## now?
yes, i may not get another chance.

## my dad told you?
now, get moving so you can make it up to me later.

## gold?
right behind you.

## what are you doing?
no, no.

## why isn't it working?
it needs fuel.

## see?
it'll set off the gas.

## here, will this work?
not my mall.

## they're not aliens, okay?
they're spiders who grew because they ingested toxic waste.

## see this?
all brand new.

## do you smoke?
no.

## any more people down in those mines?
yeah, i am.

## you know what?
those kind of pieces can win pulitzers too.

## and see what happens when greatness is demanded of you?
now he's at the new republic.

## how is it coming?
horrible.

## mallory, can i get some copies?
sure.

## how is it?
it's good.

## when is it due?
of course.

## when did you start talking to policy review?
i'm not.

## you think you might have something for her?
of course.

## they have?
it might invite charges of libel.

## you almost done with it, rob?
two days.

## amy?

## you just want to know how to get your name in print, right?
that sounds familiar.

## dead?
we're lost.

## you guys know what you're shopping for, right?
yeah, totally.

## what are you working on?
a piece gabriel garca marquez wrote about the falklands war.

## how about you?
young republicans at a cpac conference.

## oh, yeah?
yeah.

## but boring, right?
no.

## ahem yes, dear?
somebody for you on three someone from harper's.

## when did you start talking to harper's?
i'm not.

## could you send it to my voicemail?
very good.

## what?
i can't tell you, he made me promise.

## do you have a minute?
of course.

## he's made are you mad at me?
he's made some pretty serious charges.

## do your notes have anything about the minibars?
that would help.

## why?
he claims the omni shoreham doesn't even have minibars.

## what's wrong?
just tell me.

## that's it?
yeah.

## the rest of the piece is solid?
well, yeah, of course.

## you're not mad?
of course not.

## do you want my notes?
have a good night.

## hi, front desk, please?
hi, i need some information.

## they can?
okay, thank you very much.

## and you are going to put that in the article, right?
gosh, alec, i don't know.

## you wouldn't want to put in something that gossipy, would you?
no, absolutely not.

## what is this?
i found it in the freezer.

## i said that a couple of years ago.
don't you remember?

## steve?
i'm going to call it a night, but thanks for having me.

## who's he?
associate editor of george.

## when did you start talking to george?
i'm really not.

## are you mad at me?
l'm not your kindergarten teacher.

## okay?
they never shut up about it.

## you're writing for the new fucking republic.
you're 24 years old, stephen!

## lsn't that good enough?
not in highland park.

## you're going to throw this out, right?
it's kind of stupid, i know.

## do you have finals this week?
okay, moving right along.

## chuck, what do you have for us?
that's a bit of a hard act to follow.

## what the hell is this?
marty told us to circle all the commas in the last issue, so he could show us how we used them improperly.

## what?
apparently the issue was rife with comma errors.

## do you understand that?
okay.

## of course, how are you, marty?
l'm in a bit of an uncomfortable situation.

## editor?
there's a catch, of course.

## would that be a problem?
they feel very he's earned a lot of loyalty there.

## will you call me at the hotel?
yeah.

## i mean, how pissy does he get whenever you try to fact check one of his pieces?
it's like i'm sorry, but we have an obligation to get our facts straight.

## let me get out of here, okay?
well, i just want to thank you all again.

## ls anyone interested in hackers?
because i met this kid named lan restil.

## you rang?
yes, i rang.

## why didn't you get this?
yeah.

## more?
please.

## what's that?
there does appear to be a state in the union named nevada.

## don't hate me, okay?
stephen, you shredded it.

## this is the new republic, remember?
nothing slides here. lf you don't have it cold, you don't turn it in, ever.

## really?
really.

## and get back to work, okay?
the mailroom floor needs scrubbing.

## do you think i could get a phone number on him from you?
look, i think it's good that you tried this.

## to get a bunch of smoke blown up your ass by a pack of editors?
yes.

## it's a little funny... isn't it?
i was just looking for steve.

## you got a minute, steve?
yeah.

## can i get them?
of course.

## are you mad at me?
no, i just need the phone numbers.

## supposed to be under debate in 21 state legislatures?
i just checked off 50 no such act.

## as long as i'm grinding away on this thing, any chance you'd share your byline with me?
forget it.

## i'm on vacation with my parents, so leave me alone.
so why don't you just share the wealth, okay?

## what kind of parent goes on vacation with their kid in early may?
that's a good question.

## who's next?
er, penenberg.

## phone number for what?
for george sims, at jukt micronics.

## you got a pen?
yeah, sure.

## ready?
yeah.

## try again, okay?

## how are your studies coming?
their fine.

## ls there anything you need?
no.

## hello?
chuck? it's steve.

## george sims?
i did, yeah.

## sort of a prick, didn't you think?
i couldn't really tell because he hung up so fast.

## are you at home, steve?
no.

## why?
l left a message on your machine.

## yeah?
okay, night, chuck.

## want a laugh?
sure.

## steve?
this doesn't look like a real business card to me.

## my office at 9:00, okay?
yeah.

## really?
hiert's online all day long.

## did you call these people and get them directly?
no, i always left messages and spoke to them when they called me back.

## was jim ghort the only one you spoke to?
yes.

## do you have a number for him?
yeah, definitely.

## by the way, what was your basis for writing that jukt was a big time software company?
i didn't.

## you weren't in restil's home, with the jukt executives?
no, i didn't mean to imply that i had been.

## did the fax come through okay?
yes, it did.

## you want to read it back to me?
sure.

## i'm sorry?
okay.

## why would a major software company put their website where only aol members can access it, as opposed to the entire web?
i have no idea.

## how so?
quite frankly, it doesn't look like a real website.

## could somebody do that?
of course.

## do you still want that number for jim ghort?
i found it in my notes.

## sorry?
oh.

## oh, you know what it was?
jim ghort was the guy who told me about the law enforcement officials.

## are we off the record?
lf you like.

## i mean, why didn't you back me up?
i mean, i'm the editor.

## just editor to editor?
sure.

## completely off the record, and really almost human being to human being?
of course.

## so given everything that's happened, how strongly are you going to stand behind the story?
i'm looking into it.

## what about?
let's do it in private.

## what for?
these forbes guys want to come down on you.

## okay?
steve.

## i can back them off for a day or two, okay?
okay.

## the hacker conference was near here, right?
yeah, the building next door.

## how many people were at this thing?
it looked like a hundred, might have been two.

## here?
yeah, they moved in and out.

## excuse me sir, can i help you?
yes, you can.

## are you sure you're in the right building, sir?
yes, we're sure.

## why is that?
building's closed on sunday.

## that's why the restils only stayed a few minutes, okay?
because it was such a dumb place to squeeze into.

## huh?
people at the dinner.

## how many?
about 10, i think, including me.

## hiert was there too?
yeah.

## ls it near here?
yeah, it's across the street.

## this is the place?
yes.

## i didn't do anything wrong, okay?
i didn't do anything wrong.

## it was 10 people?
yes.

## for dinner?
yes.

## okay?
but it was a couple of minutes before 3:00, and lan looked like he was about ready to cry, and so they said okay.

## but for dinner?
go in and ask them yourself, chuck.

## i'm sorry i yelled at you back there.
you're supposed to support me, and you're taking their word against mine?

## okay.
chuck?

## you weren't at the conference?
no.

## okay?
and i wanted the piece to have an eyewitness feel to it, for color so...

## and everything we just told the forbes guys?
i'm so sorry, chuck.

## can you do that?
there might be facets of this that you're not considering.

## why are you defending him?
nobody's defending him, chuck.

## you know?
he sat down, and he hand wrote a bunch of phony quotes and handed them in as source material for the fact check.

## doesn't that offend you?
of course it does.

## how's he doing?
well, he's a wreck, of course.

## so...?
obviously he needs some help.

## what are you doing here?
i'm so dead.

## nobody's ever going to hire me again, are they?
l was so sloppy, trusting my sources like that.

## no?
a couple of times,

## now who's going to hire me?
steve, i have to ask you something.

## was that true?
hello.

## ls there a problem?
well, i don't know.

## david, what is the problem?
he asked me if i would drive him out to dulles later tonight.

## did he say where he was going?
yeah, he said he'd be staying with his family for a while.

## his parents live in highland park, right?
yeah.

## i'm sorry?
his brother, at stanford.

## the phony recording from jukt micronics?
it's a palo alto number.

## they are?
yeah.

## what?
i want you out of here, and you can't take anything with you.

## there are some files, okay?
i have to put them on a disk.

## jesus christ.
can i at least shut down my computer?

## can i take my rolodex?
steve...

## can i take my law books?
sure.

## okay?
i'm not a criminal.

## chuck...?
i said i was sorry.

## chuck?
um...

## the the thing with george sims?
that was the voice the voice that you heard on the telephone, that was my brother.

## i just thought that if i could get everybody off my back, okay?
for just a day.

## you can understand that, can't you?
you're fired, steve.

## what?
you're fired.

## chuck... will you please take me to the airport?
jesus.

## please, okay?
you don't have to talk to me if you don't want to.

## okay?
yeah.

## chuck, please?
stop pitching, steve.

## you've always been a smart, thorough reporter.
would you take his word for it?

## why can't you be one now?
because what you're telling me is impossible, chuck.

## ls that the kind of magazine you want to run?
every competitor we ever took a shot at, they're going to pounce.

## ls everyone in the conference room?
um hm.

## you know what could've prevented all this, don't you?
no.

## what?
pictures.

## how could you make up characters if everyone you wrote about had to be photographed?
you know, stephen... if you wanted to, you could do these kids a giant favor.

## yeah?
yeah.

## we don't want a bunch of teenagers getting ulcers, do we?
good morning.

## well, what do you think of this guy?
thank you.

## stephen?
l know you can't admit guilt of any kind, but i want you to confirm a few titles for me.

## ls that clear to everyone?
okay.

## can we move along?
holy trinity.

## and you know what?
those kinds of pieces can win pulitzers too.

## as soon as i get this piece done.
steve?

## how is it coming?
horrible.

## how is it?
it's good.

## will you guys help me with it, please?
of course.

## you almost done with it, rob?
two days.

## amy?
just finished the piece on ethanol subsidies.

## oh, yeah?
yeah.

## i can be back in 20 minutes.
do you have a minute?

## that's it?
yeah.

## do you want my notes?
no, absolutely not.

## apparently the issue was rife with comma errors.

## i mean...
and get back to work, okay?

## it's a little funny... isn't it?
yeah.

i'm sorry?

## oh.
can we have a talk here?

## okay?
yeah.

## steve?
steve.

## that's why the restils only stayed a few minutes, okay?
because it was such a dumb place to squeeze into.

## huh?
people at the dinner.

## this is the place?
yes.

## it was 10 people?
yes.

## i know, they almost didn't let us in.
for dinner?

## i thought i had it solid.

## okay?
and i wanted the piece to have an eyewitness feel to it, for color... so...

## he just made it up.
how's he doing?

## so...?
obviously he needs some help.

## can i take my rolodex?
steve...

## come on.
can i take my law books?

## chuck?
stop pitching, steve.

## no.
don't you know that?

## yeah?
yeah.

## well, what do you think of this guy?
one, two, three, four beautiful ladies.

## what are you doing?

## they just haven't seen half of a dress.
how did that happen?

## you know how you get there?
you meet the nice guy, you get married, and you get to experience... the miracle of life.

## will i be seeing you in four months?
yes, i will.

## what are you wearing?
i don't know.

## you took these from the photo shoot?
you know you're not supposed to take the clothes you model.

## what is this?
oh, bubble wrap.

## you like that?
hey.

## how are you?
hi.

## sunday brunch gridlock?
oh, i know.

## can we wait like normal, patient adults?

## jenny, can i call you back?
jenny.

## what?
oh, no.

## helen, what's the matter?
look at helen.

## jenny... helen, what happened?
hello.

## are you sure?
jumped the center divide and he slammed into them.

## so what happens now with the kids?
oh, hey.

## do the kids have any grandparents?
yes.

## i mean, can't we use something else?
helen.

## what?
it's not a mistake.

## can i read yours?
helen.

## are there any contingencies?
yes.

## when should i tell them?
as soon as possible.

## are you sure?
yep.

## this?
won't kill me for years.

## who's gonna take me to school?
i guess i am.

## and make me chicken fingers?
me.

## and give me a bath?
me.

## and check my nose boogies for infections?
we'll find someone else to do that last thing.

## is aunt helen older than you, audrey?
get farther down.

## is she playing hide and go seek?
i don't think so.

## aunt helen, can we go to the statue of liberty tomorrow?
no, because we won't be here...

## where's henry?
he said he'd be right back.

## i go to the bathroom for five seconds, and he's gone?
with mustard.

## you don't want mustard?
aunt helen.

## can you pay aaron, please?
and we'll all go together.

## where are we going to dinner?
this is dinner.

## sleepless sally gets really upset when the kids aren't going to sleep.
how many beds do you have in your apartment, aunt helen?

## sarah?
this was great.

## more time?
yeah.

## what about them?
they've got school.

## that's your plan, jenny.
are you happy now?

## all right, well, what about the idea of not selling lindsay's house?
i know you guys offered to pay the mortgage, but it's enormous.

## besides being my idea, what's wrong with moving down the block?
i mean, i think the calm of the familiar is better than the overwhelming hustle bustle of the city.

## guys, can you please keep the coloring on the eggs and not each other?
oh, no, no, no.

## why are you being a brat?
you're a brat.

## we need to help aunt helen.
you know what?

## ok?
that's the girl looking at 4b.

## i'll put you on a waiting list if a two opens up.
that's it?

## and look at this flower power, huh?
so i guess audrey can have the back room and henry and sarah can share the middle one and i'll just sleep on a pull out couch.

## how does that work?
when somebody buzzes, you stick your head out the window and you look down.

## don't chew on the windowsills, all right?
yeah.

## so, it's not that bad, right, jen?
no.

## hello.
so i see you have kids too, so maybe a play date sometime?

## can i ask you a special favor?
yes.

## these aren't her kids?

## can you handle the tuition?
not a problem.

## pretty much the standard heaven, hell, purgatory thing?
pretty much.

## you wanna go see the basketball courts?

## will you be joining us at saint barbara's?
i hope so.

## some kind of scooter?

## your shoes?

## ok?
let me help you.

## sweetheart, are you nervous about today?
i mean, it's a big day at school.

## when will you be home from work?
by dinnertime.

## audrey's in charge, though, so listen to her, ok?
i don't wanna listen to her.

## pastor wells, would you please show henry and audrey to the home room?
sure.

## wait, what about lunch?

## can you break a 20?

## sarah, do you want some crayons?
oh, no, not those.

## who's this?

## who's your date?
his name is pt.

i didn't say that.

## um, nilma, have you met the principal of our school?
hi.

## how can i come down on her for something we were caught doing a few days ago?

## in the balcony of the church?
seemed like a good idea at the time.

## sarah, honey, why don't you go play with turtle and figure out a name for him?
i just couldn't stand the idea of you losing something else you cared so much about.

## can i put him in a bowl?
yeah.

## why do you want to name everything hippo?
because i can spell it.

## could you just do it, please?
open it up and give me your fake id.

## what?
it's not over till the fat lady swings.

## see?
i'm supposed to...

## where's my son?
it's the general.

## why is there a fire?
i'll be there in five minutes.

## why stay silent?
it doesn't matter anymore.

## who made him betray his country and name?
the same person who betrayed me.

## what is this?
the top american agent...... in the north korean high command was executed a week ago.

## and they think it's me?
you were the only inmate.

## and what do you think?
with the drugs they gave you, you wouldn't know what you said.

## along with my freedom?
for as long as i deem necessary, yes.

## or even any luggage, sir?
mr. bond, so good to see you.

## been busy, have we, mr. bond?

hong kong is our turf now.

## what's in it for you?
chance to get even.

## cuba?
it seems mr. zao has lost himself in havana.

## delectados?
we haven't made delectados in 30 years.

## they are particularly hazardous for one's health, mr...?
bond.

## do you know why?
it's the addition of the volado tobacco.

## a tourist?
a terrorist.

## mind if i borrow these?
please.

## it is, isn't it?
too bad it's lost on everybody else.

## mojito?
you should try it.

## jinx, you say?
born on friday the 13th.

## do you believe in bad luck?
let's just say my relationships don't seem to last.

## and why is that?
it's when their prey comes out to drink.

## too strong for you?
i could learn to like it.

## how much time have you got?
until dawn.

## what about you?
i'm just here for the birds.

## ornithologist, huh?
now there's a mouthful.

## so you're gonna be busy tonight with the owls then?

## are you always this frisky?
i've been missing the touch of a good woman.

## what do you want?
i don't need a wheelchair.

## no?
you do now.

## what an amazing coincidence.
who's bankrolling your makeover, zao?

## interesting station, moneypenny?

## well, bond got away real fast, didn't he?
it is what he's trained to do.

## when's he coming?
i don't know.

## will you be using your title, mr. graves?
i'm proud of my adopted nation, but i'd never stand on ceremony.

## after that entrance, you can't be surprised...... you're called a self publicizing adrenaline junkie, can you?
we've heard about the icarus space program.

## what's the secret?

## settle downstairs, shall we?
you're a rare challenge, mr. bond.

## icarus?
perhaps you could join us.

## can i expect the pleasure of you in iceland?
i'm afraid you'll never have that pleasure.

## did you expect an apology?
i know you'll do whatever it takes to get the job done.

## so, what do you have?
nothing beyond the official biography.

## and his demonstration this weekend?
probably just another publicity stunt.

## there's always an excuse, isn't there, double o zero?
give me the old firing range any day.

## so this is where they keep the old relics, then, eh?
this is where our most cutting edge technology is developed.

## does this still work?
now, look...

## so where is this cutting edge stuff?
i'm trying to get to it.

## like my run?

## what happened to you?
bond.

## you saw my father after your exchange?

## what the hell is going on here?
priorities have changed, al.

i'm not going to let you do this.

allow me to kick start your memory.

## you could have every wanda on the planet.
what is your answer?

## why settle for leftovers?
we'll have to dig a little deeper.

## what is this?
this is where old folks go after florida, son.

## can i dig up my body now?
why, certainly.

## hello, my mutant, hello, my carcass, hello, my bug infested corpse.
how about we get back to that sacrifice a virgin idea?

## did, like, satan send you guys?
god hogs up all the good followers, and we get all the retards.

## help.
what's up with that face?

## shocked and amazed at the wonders of necroflesh?
look at you.

## you were tied to the tracks, and that stupid train just kept running over you, didn't it?
running over you.

## you done with this hallmark moment?
i can't take any more of this sentimental crap.

## who are you?
an assassin... like you.

## or is everyone just back from hell?
i think the government has been attentive... to the sensitivities of the nations involved.

## has this produced results?
last week's peace summit between arabs and lsraelis... was disrupted by bomb threats from the christian coalition.

i'll explain later.

## spaz?

## puking up decent food, boy?
it's rotten.

## you think we eat so good you can just spit up what you like?

## what makes you think i would join your army?

## you've been violated, girlie man, huh?
i could have killed you like that.

## is that a little more surprise than you wanted?
twinkle, twinkle, little spawn.

## you're not excited yet?
helter skelter's coming down with or without you.

i might.

## no matter how you find him.

## you want some water?

of course i am.

## so what's it gonna be?
time's running out.

## is that right?
if my heart stops, the virus is released, and everybody in the world dies.

## never.
how could you let him kill me?

## your perfect attendance record, you spoon sucking dipstick?
i was counting on spawn killing you.

## you were checking me out from the start, weren't you?
i'm too old for this.

## what if i sided with clown?
i'd have killed you.

## wanda, what do you think about a little head?
this is your last chance to join up.

## is it true the documents you've uncovered... implicate jason wynn?
yes.

## are the heat 16 bombs still a danger?
the entire heat 16 weapon system has already been destroyed.

## do you have any further comments?
something i should have done a long time ago.

## you see?
nothing.

## i know, can you believe that?
we could always test you a third time, rodney.

## what am i supposed to do?
he s afraid of the thing.

## what are you saying, dr. jackson?
it s an 8 symbol address.

## you like it here?
yes sir.

## like what?
now s good.

## wasn t me.
sir, what the hell was that?

## keep my ass from getting blown out of the sky?
the exceptional flying of major john sheppard.

## what say we cut to the part where you start talking real fast?
ah, weir s in here.

## in their flying city?
yes.

## flying city?
well, uh, keep in mind this is the race that built the stargates they did everything big.

## um who knows?
we know the ancients on earth were suffering from a plague.

## but isn t that reason enough to go?
well i ve been choosing members for this expedition for months, dr.

## what?
the z. p. m. he s, uh, he s canadian.

## me?
you re the one who fired that thing at me.

## you mean the drone?
the weapon the ancients built to defend this outpost.

## you do have security clearance to be here?
yeah, yeah, general o neill just gave it to me.

## the what?
jack, you know that gating to another galaxy requires an enormous amount of power.

## you think there are more of these zed things in atlantis?
i said don t touch anything.

## did i do that?
we could be on our way to discovering an entirely new ancient civilization.

## oh, don t you have a dozen or so people already who can use the ancient technology?
yeah, with concentration and training they can make it work.

## really?
this isn t a long trip so i il be as succinct as possible.

## what?
with all due respect, sir, we were just attacked by an alien missile.

## why d you become a pilot?
i think people that don t wanna fly are crazy.

## does anyone else here speak the language these guy's are speaking?
i just need a couple of minutes to finish my work, and you're not helping by standing there.

## we there yet?
we re just waiting on dr. mckay.

## can i have everyone s attention please?
all right, here we go.

## that would be dr. weir, right?
chevron three encoded.

## what is it we re looking at?
switching to zero locks.

## it s structurally in tact?
the climactic sensors say there s oxygen, no measurable toxins ; we have viable life support.

## what does it feel like?
hurts like hell, sir.

## security teams, any alien contact?
negative, sir.

## can you come down and meet me please?
we re three levels down, come in.

## so it might really be the lost city of atlantis?
not much. could travel between the stars, exchanging knowledge and friendship.

## what does that mean?
that if we don t stop everything we re doing right now, we are dead.

## what if it fails completely?
it s a matter of when, not if.

## all right, well how much time do we have?
it s hard to say.

## what about our own power generators?
we re working on that, but with our most advanced naquada power generators, the equations are coming up far short.

## well how do we do that if we can t search the city?
if there were more here, we d be able to detect them.

## can we use the stargate?
there s nowhere near enough power to open a wormhole back to earth.

## everything okay here, sheppard?
yes, sir, just a couple of kids.

## are you here to trade?
trade, yes.

## now how many times have i told you not to play in the forest after dark?
i m just glad you re safe.

## what was that mask you had on?
helps you see in the dark, check it out.

## this?
the wraith.

## can we go there?
afraid not, i come from a galaxy far, far away.

## is that a fact?
well then, we il just uh, we il have to get to know each other.

## will you join us?
i love a good cup of tea.

## who are these wraith?
we have never met anyone who did not know.

## what if the wraith are the enemy the ancient hologram lady is talking about?
all the more reason for us to have a defensible position should we need to abandon atlantis.

## do i?
no.

## then there is something you should see.
you truly cannot return to your world?

## how much further is this place?
not far.

## what s this?
i lost this years ago.

## someone s been busy, huh?
the drawings in the caves are extensive.

## does this represent the destruction of your city?
this drawing far predates that.

## someone knew it was gonna happen?
i believe it happens again, and again.

## where the hell is he?
they are not really there.

## what am i looking for?
there another part of the force field just failed.

## the city is sacrificing parts of itself in order to maintain these main areas, but catastrophic failure is inevitable.
how are we doing?

## to save it for whom?
survivors from the settlement ; we were attacked.

## what s going on?
we are in no position to help anyone right now.

## what the hell s going on here?
we were about to abandon the city.

## jinto, you have any other address where we can gate to?
yes, many.

## so now could our naquada generators supply enough power to the shield for defensive purposes?
not even close.

## all right, just shut up and listen to me for a moment, all right?
come on, what do we know about the wraith.

## why?
i don t need to answer your question because the people in charge didn t consider the ramifications before they reacted.

## how am i supposed to react?
and we re defenseless, you said so yourself.

## how do you know going off on some half assed rescue mission isn t going to bring them all right back here to our doorstep?
maybe it will, but it s the right thing to do.

## why?
because it is.

## do you know what that means?
it s just a matter of time before the wraith figure out that this is the base of our operations.

## we weren t there for more than a few hours before they showed up.
i mean who knows?

## and that one of these people you brought back here with you tipped them off?
it s possible.

## any idea what to expect?
no.

## how do i know he s not the one who told them?
someone comes.

## we re the ones you re after, right?
i m their leader.

## wait, what was that?
rotate the camera.

## you re sure this is the right address?
it s the only one we could get a lock on.

## dr. beckett, what was it you wanted me to see?
these cells have none of the normal human inhibiting proteins whatsoever.

## i say that anything he saw was caused by a residual command language in the severed nerve endings.
what about the movement major sheppard saw?

## very, very old.
all right, anything else?

## i don t blame ya.
how old?

## what is that noise?
i...

## ready?
i have no idea.

## a little puddle jumper like this?
it s a ship, it goes through the gate.

## i thought we were going with gate ship?
negative, flight.

## did you do that?
i was just wondering where we go from here.

## so how do we find them once we land?
well i ve been thinking about that too.

## is my son alive?
he s well and waiting for you.

## where s colonel sumner?
he was taken by the wraith.

## how about when?
not long.

## how bout a diversion a little bit?
we re gonna need to make some noise out there.

## rig up the c4 to blow a hole and get these people out of here on my signal, all right?
i can find the colonel with this, there aren t that many wraith around.

## what do you call yourself?
colonel marshall sumner, united states marine corps.

## is it valor or ignorance?
we traveled through the stargate as peaceful explorers.

## feeding ground?
all living things must eat.

## why do you care?
hunger is distasteful.

## what do you call your world?
earth.

## more?
our feeding ground has not been so rich in ten thousand years.

## is that the kind of treatment i can expect for myself and my people?
as i have said, all living things must eat.

## where is this new feeding ground?
i won t...

## how s the hand feeling?
much better.

## how did this come to you?
i don t remember.

## how d you find me?
tread marks, standard issue.

## how many are left?
sir, we need to leave.

## colonel sumner?
we are well enough.

## what can we do?
we re safe as long as they can t see us.

## then how can we get through?
we have to draw them away from the gate and double back.

## you see anything like a weapons console over there?
try and go invisible again.

## do we have an identification code?
nothing yet.

## no?
look around you.

## how come i never make friends like that?
you need to get out more.

## is there lemon in this?
one more thing major.

## well you are the ranking military officer now, or do you need to be reminded of that?
we need to get back out there ; do what we came to do.

## stop it.

the guys said you're interested in ufos.

## do you think they land here?
no, but they fly close to here.

## do they?
if you hear about anything, i'd love to go with you.

## why not?
people go to africa to watch dolphins from boats.

why couldn't people watch ufos from a delivery truck here?

## want me to wait for you?
sure.

## is she your sister?

## in kosovo, say?
doubtful.

## is everything all right?
yes.

## did we have company?
no.

## which flowers?
i don't believe it.

## what did he want?
he came to inspect the stove.

## ondrej?
not having a gas stove is no reason to get hysterical.

## really?
last time someone threw away a high power vacuum cleaner.

## are you recording this?
yup.

## do you have anything to drink?
otherwise i wouldn't try...

## how do you know it was a high power vacuum?
there was a grinder here.

## did you see the grinder?
nope.

## why do you collect this junk?
my son is a disappointment and i want to be remembered for something.

## would you go with them?
i'll shoot the breeze with them.

## think so?
you bet.

## measured by what?
moral maturity...

## so on the other planets you need three beings?
no, seven.

## why are we here, anyway?
i guess we're waiting for ufos.

## why are we here, anyway?
you don't really believe in ufos.

## then why are you in prague?
i came here to see dad.

## your dad?
yup.

## is he in this country?
yup.

## does he know about you?
nope.

## want to tell me about it?
nope.

## understand?
of course.

## why did you live with me if it was that horrible?
sorry, we were stoned.

## know what your problem is?
you've never done anything for anyone.

## for you?
this isn't about me.

## would you give up anything at all?
of course.

## do you want me to jump off a bridge for you?
no, i just wanted you to be brave about our break up.

## so you wanted to come back to me because i broke up with you?
yeah.

## what?
as station manager i am responsible for what you play.

## get it?
yes.

## how did you know that?
because the guy pinned in the car was a sign.

## a sign?
we find a guy pinned in his car the first time we meet.

## didn't that seem like a sign to you?
yeah, i guess so.

## dubrovnik?
this is prague, you moron.

## so you really steal, huh?
knock it off.

## why?
let him steal.

## what do you want to be?
a mover.

## do i know you?
i'm ondrej.

## why wouldn't he?
then i'll put it in some food.

## coffee?
no, thanks.

## do you have any mixes?
we must.

## you've made a mess of your life, haven't you?
i'm offering you a way out.

## life with a psychopath might be your only way out.
what way?

## i'm a wreck, too.
or are you looking for someone who'll leave you in a year?

## me?
just as friends.

## what are you staring at?
it wasn't that big a deal.

## what did you bake?
some excellent pastry.

## what is this?
nothing.

## did you set us on fire?
no, i didn't.

## wasn't it?
please...

## why did you film this?
i don't know.

## interesting?
yup.

## that's quite sad, isn't it?
yes, but it's also fascinating.

## live with her?
you already have a girlfriend.

## say what?
c'mon, alice.

## alice who?
you tell me.

## do you even know your own name?
listen, quit smoking pot.

## i thought we'd start going out, but the guys said i already had a girlfriend.
do you want me to go schizo?

## which guys?
from the band.

## you're joking, right?
no, i'm not.

## you don't want to hurt anyone?
i'm sorry.

## where have you been?
we started without you.

## where have you been?
we started without you.

## what is this?
beef.

## later, okay?
the father is indicating that they can talk later.

## i came to see you because i feel awful and i need to talk to you.
what the hell is this?

## do you know why you feel awful?
it's that lifestyle of yours.

## i see.
isn't it odd for a girl your age to move all the time?

## what?
you have an obligation.

## did you wash your hands?
yes.

## which video?
from robert's party.

## should i pack my things?
of course not.

## do you?
of course.

## do you think so?
of course you love us.

## did you think you loved her?
yes, i did.

## what's she like?
she's a bit selfish and tough, and she never gives up without a fight.

## is it even worth the effort?
it occurred to me that the guy i took to the hospital...

## can you tell us...
what kind of sign?

## how are we supposed to address the fhrer?
heil, mein fhrer.

## and the nazi salute?
that won't be necessary... since the fhrer isn't looking for a soldier, but for a secretary.

## can i ask your name?
margarethe lorenz.

## where are you from?
from fulda.

## and what is your name?
ursula puttkammer.

## where are you from?
frankfurt am main, mein fh...

## and you are?
traudl humps.

## shall we start then, frulein humps?
my blondi won't hurt you.

## how old are you?
22, mein fhrer.

## where would it be coming from?
you're right.

## where is that cannon fire coming from?
happy birthday, mein fhrer.

## where did they come from?
we don't know yet.

## koller, do you know berlin is under artillery fire?
no.

## can't you hear the shooting?
no, i'm in wildpark werder.

## are the russians that close?
they should hang the entire luftwaffe leadership.

## why not?
you're married to the sister of eva braun.

## do you want to die here?
absolutely not.

## what's going on?
we're leaving.

## and who's going to look after the people and the soldiers?
don't ask me, professor.

## is that so?
food supply would collapse.

## and when there's fighting all over the city, where does he get it?
the population.

## too late?
hewel, come here for a moment.

## politics?
i don't do politics anymore.

## what did you expect from a vegetarian teetotaller?
seriously, though, fegelein.

## why do you think they'll negotiate with you?
the nazi state and my ss are needed to maintain order.

## should i give eisenhower the nazi salute or shake his hand?
look at that.

## leaving already, gentlemen?
i wanted to talk to you.

## speer...... what do you think?
you have to be on the stage when the curtain falls.

## to play at war?
go home.

## what do you want?
i want my son.

## at which front did you fight?
i haven't had the honour yet.

## which position?
this is not a position, it's a trap.

## what with?
with the anti aircraft guns.

## do you really think you'll last even five minutes?
we promised the fhrer.

## don't you understand?
the war is lost.

## using which units?
steiner will attack from the north and join the 9th army.

## do you doubt my orders?
i think i've been clear enough.

## with all due respect, what will happen to the women and children...... and the thousands of wounded and elderly?
in a war such as this one, there are no civilians.

## but why don't you tell him that?
he doesn't listen to reason.

## are you crazy?
he'll throw us out.

## where were you?
none of your business.

## what will happen to us?
i could go if i wanted to.

## we can't all go, can we?
i can't go either.

## life will go on.
life will go on.

## what do you think, herr oberst?
we have to go.

## go where?
i don't know.

## if the war is lost, what does it matter that the people are lost too?
the primary necessities of life of the german people aren't relevant, right now.

## care to dance, frulein braun?
i'd love to.

## may i?
go ahead.

## what's wrong?
we have to leave berlin, eva.

## can somebody play some music?
i want to dance.

## do you have a request?
as long as it swings.

## how so?
i'm at 1000 meters from the enemy.

## and, general?
i'll be executed.

## why?
they think i moved my command post to the west.

## you're a doctor, aren't you?
yes, an internist.

## what about?
i'm going to be executed.

## why am i going to be executed?
you know that any evasive manoeuvre towards the west is forbidden.

## what do you mean?
my troops have been fighting for days.

## do you see this?
i don't want you to use that tone with me.

## how should i know?
i'm going to have a look.

## see that?
that's where the reich ends.

## may i?
he's damned stubborn.

## why doesn't he let me do that?
i should have been back by now.

## are you sure the fhrer still needs me?
drink.

## but you don't think steiner will attack, do you?
i doubt whether steiner is able to do anything...... but you probably know that better than i do.

## is it german artillery that i hear?
i'm afraid not.

## but hasn't steiner's attack started?
you have to go as fast as you can.

## what does he have to lose?
i don't believe a word of it.

## is this what it came to?
the military, everybody lied to me.

## how can i be a leader under these circumstances?
it's over.

## the fhrer wasn't serious about killing himself, was he?
frau junge, frau christian.

## now what?
time to end this charade.

## do you want us to stop fighting?
that's inconceivable.

## and then what?
no capitulation.

## what will happen to us?
gnsche says there's a tunnel that goes under the russian lines.

## why did you say you wanted to stay with him?
i don't know.

## where do they come from?
volkssturm.

## what is all this?
a greifkommando.

## what's this?
you have no authority here.

## you maybe?
stop it.

## can you operate?
not really.

## can you look after them for a moment?
thank you.

## brigade fhrer, what can i do for you?
your volkssturm is an easy prey for the russians.

## where are you?
i decided not to die in berlin.

## does my sister know where you are?
think about it.

## do you remember the song?
the best thing to do is to shoot yourself in the mouth.

## can i have one too?
me too.

## any questions?
no, mein fhrer.

## ... do you agree that i take charge...... with complete freedom of action?
if i receive no reply by 2200 hours...... i'll assume you have been incapacitated.

## how dare he say i'm incapacitated?
hello.

## how did you get into berlin?
it wasn't easy, but i must speak to the fhrer.

## what did he turn that into?
for that alone, he should be executed.

## is there any hope left?
frau junge, leave from here before it's too late.

## we can't leave him behind, can we?
he doesn't need anybody for what awaits him.

## and go where?
i can arrange for you to be taken to schwanenwerder by barge.

## did he ever doubt that?
lately, he often thought you were against him too.

## has he gone insane?
he must have told them i'm sick.

## what?
he's himmler's assistant.

## do you think i'll sit and wait until those jewish swine slaughter me?
this is part of a huge decoy manoeuvre.

## you also request to leave berlin?
mein fhrer, as you know, all medical departments...... that fall under the ss and himmler, have left berlin.

## what, you can't find fegelein?
keep searching.

## ernst, is something wrong?
no.

## what is it?
gruppenfhrer, you're under arrest.

## what?
you're suspected of desertion.

## you can't have hermann executed, can you?
there's no doubt.

## what does it matter?
everything's over.

## what's the point of that?
it is my wish.

## how long can you hold out?
at most, two days.

## including the government area?
yes.

## where are wenck's vanguard located?
2.

## when will they attack again?
3.

## where is the 9th army?
4.

## where will the 9th make a breakthrough?
you'll see, gentlemen.

## what's unlikely about the offensive?
wenck can't do anything anymore.

## do you think the fhrer doesn't know?
he'll never surrender.

## did you get some rest, my child?
in shorthand.

## what is it, herr minister?
imagine this.

## can i see your identity card?
you're talking to the fhrer here.

## and you, frulein braun, are you of aryan descent?
then there's nothing to stop us.

## do you, eva braun, take fhrer adolf hitler, present here...... as your husband?
then i declare you man and wife.

## how long can we hold out?
twenty hours, no more.

## what do we do when the last ammunition reserves have been exhausted?
i'll never surrender.

## where should i find them?
from the parked vehicles.

## what's all that petrol for?
i can't say.

## should i tell the fhrer you're indisposed?
it's only my collapsed lung.

## can we sit down?
please do, frulein...

## what are you doing here?
i have to report to the fhrer.

## will i have enough time?
the poison starts working after one or two seconds.

## when he's the fhrer, you mean?
come, let's smoke another one.

## children, what are you doing here?
we want to see aunt eva and uncle hitler.

## have you eaten anything yet?
only breakfast.

## what is it?
leave berlin.

## what will become of us?
tomorrow, i'll be cursed by millions, but that's how it is.

## why?
nothing can happen to us here.

## can it?
no.

## are you crazy?
for that damned petrol of yours...

## what news do you have, general?
adolf hitler and his wife committed suicide in the bunker.

## general, if you were me, would you make peace with you?
my government will never accept unconditional surrender.

## surrender?
never.

## what's happening?
we're surrendering.

## how long does it work?
around four hours.

## heide, you're always so brave?
have another sip.

## see?
that wasn't so bad.

## do you want to get sick?
please, mama.

## so what?
i want to get away.

## how do we get through the lines?
doesn't matter.

## don't you see what's going on here?
i insist that you help us, as a doctor.

## are you alright?
keep going.

## who's that?
a german.

## herr hewel?
thank god, you're alive.

## where are the others?
i don't know, frau junge.

## what's going to happen to us?
maybe you can get through.

## can i join you?
the fhrer's dead.

## do you want to continue the war on your own?
i'm obliged by my oath.

## so?
no opposition.

## what shall we do?
we can't surrender.

## what exactly do you mean?
when the russians come, we'll empty our weapons on them.

## is this prestigious murder and suicide our only option?
we're ss officers.

## come and sit down with me?
please.

## see this?
the fhrer gave it to me personally.

## as a last decoration?
maybe.

## but why?
maybe he didn't want me to be forced...... to say anything bad about him.

## who will benefit if you stick to your deal?
there they are.

## do you think i'll sit and wait until those jewish swine slaughter me?
this is part of a huge decoy manoeuvre.

## you also request to leave berlin?
mein fhrer, as you know, all medical departments...... that fall under the ss and himmler, have left berlin.

i'm nervous.

## george?
george doesn't know poop from applesauce.

## but where are you?
now, listen closely.

## is that stuart?
let me think.

## found what?
the calculator.

## will, where's stuart?
it's okay.

## i just need to get the calculator?
to figure out how long to rehearse.

i'll think of something.

## is anybody here?

## what are you waiting for?
this kid's priceless.

## tell me, cheese face, does this sound familiar?
oh, my wing.

## what are you talking about?
i can't drill through the wood.

## margalo, what does he mean?
okay, now it's getting sad.

## but, margalo, why?
don't be upset, mouse boy.

## a real friend?
i didn't lie about that, stuart.

## was that your best shot?
now, let me show you mine.

## what have i done?
i'll bet something terrible has happened.

## who am i kidding?
i have to get up there.

## but how?
i hope i live to regret this.

## yoo hoo?
come out, come out wherever you are.

## where are you?
ln the can.

## is this some kind of trick?
just get me out.

## is stuart in there, too?
no, snowbell, he's dead.

## stuart is dead?
falcon killed him.

## really?
no.

## george and will?
this is terrible.

## what have i done?
and this time, the truth.

## is it okay to break a promise to your brother?
it's wrong to promise your brother you'll lie to your parents.

## how would we all feel if anything happened to stuart?
he's at the pishkin building.

## am i in trouble?
no, son.

## who would do this?
or else you'll lose this.

## oh, and what do you think you'll be without me?
i think this is it.

frederick, i feel so helpless.

## party's over, fur face.
what do you mean?

## got you.
what's he doing?

## can't i get a decent meal in this city?
i am now.

## what did you think you were doing?
you almost gave me a heart attack.

## then why am i so proud of you?
mrs. little, this belongs to you.

## snowbell, where have you been?
you wouldn't believe what stuart and margalo have been through.

## tuna?
i guess.

## you've always dreamed of going, haven't you?
but falcon never let you.

## you're sure of the way?
we can call aaa.

## only what, dear?
well, now it's not just talk.

## are you scared?
the world's pretty big, and i'm pretty small.

## what's the silver lining this time?
she'll be back in the spring.

## when she can fall from a tree and land on her feet, then i'll be impressed.
did you hear that?

## honey, are you all right?
you're dreaming.

## is that better?
my poor baby.

## who?
the one you told me about.

## who is she?
nobody.

## what's her name?
i don't know.

## you mean it?
you know i do.

## doug?
let's do it.

## do what?
move to mars.

## why do you have to spoil a perfectly wonderful morning?
just think about it.

## you believe him?
okay.

## lori, move. that you've closed the pyramid mine... because you found alien artifacts inside?
there's a lot better places than mars.

## don't you wanna see saturn?
i wish we could find some artifacts.

## have you found kuato yet?
we don't even know what he looks like.

## what do you say?
that's the news.

## don't you understand?
i feel like i was made for something more than this.

## have you always wanted to climb the mountains of mars... but now you're over the hill?
then come to rekall lncorporated... where you can buy the memory of your ideal vacation... cheaper, safer and better than the real thing.

## rekall?
where they sell those fake memories.

## thinking of going there?
maybe.

## why not?
a friend of mine tried it, nearly got himself lobotomized.

## no shit?
don't fuck with your brain.

## yeah?
doug quaid is here to see you.

## is there a problem?
to be perfectly honest... if you like outer space... you'd be happier with one of our saturn cruises.

## what's in the two week package?
when you go rekall, you get nothing but first class memories.

## but how real does it seem?
as real as any memory in your head.

## did he get a refund?
you're talking ancient history.

## what do you say?
all right.

## what is exactly the same... about every single vacation you have ever taken?
i give up.

## how much is that?
let me tantalize you.

## your first trip?
don't worry.

## would you like us to integrate some alien stuff?
sure.

## don't you watch the news?
we're doing alien artifacts now.

## ernie?

## what trip?
you went to rekall.

## i did?
yeah, you did.

## what are you, my father?
come on, i'll buy you a drink.

## what are you doing?
some men just tried to kill me.

## are you all right?
no, they were spies or something.

## why would spies want to kill you?
let me finish.

## what did they do to you?
i got a trip to mars.

## you call this a delusion?
doug, i'm gonna call a doctor.

## you think i'm stupid?
i remember our wedding.

## all of this was implanted?
the job's real.

## okay, then if i'm not me, who the hell am l?
beats me.

## are you okay?
i guess i blew it.

## what does he remember?
nothing, so far.

## what if they bring him back?
to the right.

## you saying she likes it?
no, i'm sure she hated every minute.

## what is going on?
i'm trying to neutralize a traitor.

## have you got that?
i want him back in place with lori.

## what was that, sir?
i couldn't hear you.

## where is he?
second level, galleria.

## how we doing?
fine.

## what do you want?
you've been bugged.

## who are you?
never mind.

## how'd you find me?
i lost him.

## can you see me down here?
this is the suitcase you gave me.

## i gave you?
i'm gonna set it here.

## who are you?
we were buddies in the agency on mars.

## what was i doing on mars?
excuse me, but this is mine.

## where can i take you tonight?
drive.

## did you find him?
we picked up an explosion at the old cement factory.

## what have we got?
nothing here.

## any news of quaid?
not since you lost him.

## how long do you plan to stay?
two weeks.

## what the hell's this?
the martians love kuato.

## have you brought any fruits or vegetables?
two weeks.

## excuse me?
two weeks.

## again?
nobody on earth cares about mars.

## you mean the pyramid mine?
i used to work there until they found that alien shit inside.

## think so?
mr. cohaagen.

## richter... do you know why i'm so happy?
no, sir.

## but i thought who told you to think?
i don't give you enough information to think.

## suppose you could play along?
yes, sir.

## you need a taxi?
i got magazines, music, whisky.

## can i help you?
i would like a room, please.

## would you like the same suite?
definitely.

## identification?
i'll encode your room key.

## could i borrow your pen, please?
certainly.

## what's wrong with this one?
he ain't got five kids to feed.

## where's yours?
the usual.

## so, where to?
last resort.

## first time on mars?
yes.

## hey, you see anything you like?
end of the line.

## what about the past?
it's around the corner, right down this alley.

## probe the secrets of your heart?
i bet i can guess your birthday.

## tell me, are all psychics freaks?
afraid so.

## what happened to them?
cheap domes, no air to clean the rays.

## why not?
there's a better place down there.

## what do you want?
melina.

## what you been feeding this thing?
blondes.

## honey, take care of tony, will you?
no problem.

## you're alive?
i thought that cohaagen tortured you to death.

## you never wondered what happened to me?
hauser, thank god you're alive.

## what?
i don't remember you.

## what are you talking about?
i don't remember you.

## how did you get here?
she wasn't really my wife.

## oh, she isn't?
how stupid of me.

## she was hauser's wife?
forget that i said wife.

## why would i lie to you?
because you're still working for cohaagen.

## inside what?
i think you'd better leave.

## really?
all right, i'm leaving.

## did you ever fuck a mutant?
i need to talk to you about mr. hauser.

## who are you?
dr. edgemar from rekall.

## how did you find me?
it's difficult to explain.

## could you open the door?
i'm unarmed.

## what do you want?
this will be hard for you to accept.

## where are we?
at rekall.

## if it is my delusion, who the hell invited you?
i've been artificially implanted as an emergency measure.

## how much is cohaagen paying you for this?
think about it.

## brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure?
just as you specified.

## is that coincidence?
she's real.

## she's real because you dreamed her?
that's right.

## would you mind opening the door?
you open it.

## sweetheart?
come in, mrs. quaid.

## that you're having a paranoid episode triggered by acute neurochemical trauma?
stop punishing yourself, doug.

## then what?
swallow this.

## what is it?
it's a symbol of your desire to return to reality.

## honey... you wouldn't hurt me, would you, sweetheart?
sweetheart, be reasonable.

## that was your wife?
what a bitch.

## need a ride?
last resort.

## what are you talking about?
i don't know.

## so what can i do?
kuato's gonna make you remember some things you knew when you were hauser.

## like what?
all sorts of things.

## oh, shit.
since when?

## who's this?
he helped us get away.

## you're a mutant, huh?
all right, let's go.

## have you tried ramming down the door?
you wait here.

## where's kuato?
on his way.

## you heard the rumors about the pyramid mine?
yeah.

## aliens?
you tell me.

## you're kuato, right?
wrong.

## what do you want, mr. quaid?

## where are you going?
to the reactor.

## what reactor?
the one in the mines.

## where's this reactor come from?

ln 30 seconds you'll be dead.

## what's wrong?
i just had a terrible thought.

## what if this is a dream?
well, then kiss me quick before you wake up.

## which serice do you require, please?
help...

## do i have to talk about it today?
you make it sound so terrible.

## so we do this at your speed, yeah?
we can stop at any time.

## it might seem really... stupid, but let's just give it a bash, ok?
take a nice deep breath.

## ok?
this is how it works at brabourne.

## oh, is he?
my best friend, martin, didn't care.

## haven't you noticed that suddenly everyone's a blonde with cherry lip gloss?
there's been an invasion of amber clones.

## he's single?

## has there been a day in the last five years that we haven't talked?

## you know the old war bunker over there?

## liz?
i don't know what happened.

## what's the time now?
same as when you asked two minutes ago.

## so what do we do?
we're being held to ransom until martin says so.

## isn't that right, lizzie?
i don't know.

## is he really your friend, frankie?
he's not mine.

## right now, we're trapped because he wants us trapped.
oh, so this is a game?

## why?
well, i guess we're gonna find out.

i presume so.

## can we talk?

## can't sleep?
it... it's about martin.

## you knew this would happen even before we came down here?
no, of course not.

i'm sorry.

## i mean, can they really keep asking the same question hour after hour?

## hey?
well, i knew she was fucked in the head, but i didn't realise she was this vicious.

## you do know that, don't you?
thanks for taking me home.

## now, if you need anything, day or night, just call me, all right?
you can go back any time you want.

## but liz is the really nasty one.

## do you have a pen?
this is how it is at brabourne.

## what is it?
amber dumped mike half an hour ago.

## the s& m dungeon martin tried to take you to?

you just had to be with them.

## have you ever craved someone so much..... that you didn't exist any more?
no.

## so you're fucking her now?
he really doesn't kiss the way i thought he would.

## what's wrong?

## what did she do to you?
geoff.

## are you here to confirm that daredevil is responsible for this, detective?
come on, urich.

## got it?
got it.

## like alligators in the sewers?
it's, like, a drawing, an artist's rendering.

## did you know that?
i sure as hell didn't.

## what is your problem with our clients?
we have good, honorable clients.

## remember when they taught us in law so you could represent people who aren't all necessarily innocent?
that was your best course, as i recall.

## and what happened to your face?
nothing.

## can i say something else?
seeing eye dogs bond for life yours ran away.

## where?
front door.

## what are you blind?
i've never seen him before.

## what do you want?
i just wanted to get your name.

## sure you don't wanna tell me your name?
you're holding back.

## does every guy have to go through all this to find out your name?
try asking for my number.

## go?
wait a second.

## that's dad.
your bodyguard?

## how am i going to find you?
somebody's been talking.

## uh i am out.
wesley, did you know, back in ancient times... they would cut the tongues out of their bodyguards their first day on the job?

## i think you'll find this a very generous offer.
you think it's funny?

## her father's nikolas natchios.
so, what do you say?

## the billionaire?
yeah.

## see?
yes, the billionaire.

## what do we got?
oh, this one's a real winner.

## what's the good news?
the fluke wasn't bad.

## could you let us in?
mr. jackson.

## who are you?
yeah.

## you do?
you got yourself a defense.

## sir?
foggy.

## have i ever been wrong?
no.

## okay, now what?
take a look around.

## why the big cover up in the death of a prostitute?
i don't know.

## matt, matt, where are you going?
give me your pen.

## leave a note?
here.

## what do i see?
ammonia.

## so what?
over blood.

## what's the word for that?
mulatto.

## can i get you anything before we land?
more peanuts, please.

## isn't he facing the wrong way?
don't worry, he's got them right where he wants them.

## does this defense come with a two drink minimum, mr. murdock?
i'm sorry, your honor, i'm trying to make a point.

## you got the arm there, matt?
just reach down.

## you got it?
okay.

## was that too much?
yeah, it was a little much.

## officer mckensie, you were the arriving officer at the scene?
that's correct.

## who?
it's ben urich, post.

## so does this mean you want a rematch?
i told you i'd find you.

## how did you know i wasn't a mugger?
uh... you're my first.

## i've cooked, cleaned, mopped up her urine!
hey, your sister didn't write the will.

## just go sit on the couch, okay?
oh.

## you're taking away my home and giving me a 20 year old car?
absolutely.

## do you understand that i have nowhere to go?
eleanor, help me.

## where?
i see it.

## and what are your feelings, mary?
tell me what your intuitions say.

## what else have we got here?
low self esteem, high narcissism, chronic feeling of emptiness, identity disturbance.

## is this where we're going?
that's hill house.

## that's perfect, isn't it?
the hill house project is absolutely essential to my research, malcom.

## what is fear, anyway?
the only problem with fear is that it has largely become inappropriate and nonadaptive.

## does a racing pulse help some kid's score on an sat?
and yet we carry with us these primordial fear responses... that do the opposite of what they were intended to do.

## so why is that?
yeah.

## what are you doing here?
i'm with dr. marrow's group.

## why do you need so many chains?
that's a good question.

## what is it about fences?
sometimes the people on either side of the fence see a locked chain, they feel a little more comfortable.

## can't do both.
why do you suppose that is?

## are you mrs. dudley?
so far.

## really?
these are beautiful.

## why would we?
no one could.

## well, everyone calls me nell, don't you love it here?
i love it.

## aren't they great?
prada.

## what do you do, eleanor?
i'm between jobs right now.

## over, so and you?
well, that depends.

## you know what i mean?
mmm, not really.

## you know what i mean?
no.

## where do you live?
mmm.

## but you know that, right?
oh, sorry.

## can you believe it?
look at that.

## isn't it beautiful?
yes.

## isn't this one great?
no, that's creepy.

## isn't it based on the gates of hell by rodin?
well, it's not just hell.

## did you study art?
no, i studied purgatory.

## do you see?
well, let's not stand here.

## is it real?
no.

## shall we go in?
yes.

## and you are?
nell vance.

## nightmares?
not really.

## anxiety attacks?
no.

## and you?
let me think.

## so how was your drive, eleanor?
it was fine.

## do you know what?
the rest of you may hate your insomnia, but i'm not sure i want a cure for mine.

## are you kidding me?
3:00 a. m.

## have you ever seen that late night tv?
oh, yeah.

## nembutal?
mm mm.

## what are the basics?
food, water, shelter.

## god knows i'm all for helping people, saving the world, but doesn't everybody have a problem sleeping these days?
life's too frantic.

## what about you, nell?
but, um, i don't know.

## what is wrong with you people?
these are standard cognitive and perception tests.

## seriously, isolation is essential... in the creation of an experimental model.
you are not in competition, so do not worry about being the head of the class, okay?

## who lived here?
well, actually, that makes for a very good bedtime story.

## what happened?
let me see.

## what were you doing?
this'll stop the blood from getting into her eye.

## okay, mary?
okay.

## may i ask you not to tell the women?
yeah, yeah.

## you guys wanna hear something really scary?
i just found this out.

## remember his lovely wife, rene?
well, rene, the town beauty, she didn't just die.

## he just told you that?
yes.

## like maybe hugh crain was a horrible monster and drove her to it.
why did she kill herself?

## and equally overdone.
monster?

## why didn't he tell us?
he didn't say.

## for me?
yeah.

## you've been out of the world a long time, haven't you?
yeah.

## are you all right?
yeah, yeah, yeah.

## well, uh, listen, you should try and get some sleep, huh?
yeah, that's a good idea.

## how's this one?
i don't know.

## where's it coming from?
it's everywhere.

## can you feel it, nell?
mm hmm.

## nell, can you feel it?
oh.

## nell?
it's moving.

## it's over, right?
nell, come back here.

## hey, is everything okay?
oh, god.

## did you hear it?
yeah, i just heard it.

## here, let me look.
i w w was it part of the experiment?

## are there any lights?
yes.

## is that what you heard?
well, i did just take a bath.

## yeah, but then how do you explain the breath and the cold?
i don't know.

## the cold, who felt it first?
oh, i think it was me.

## well, eleanor, if it was you, did you say theo?
theo, if it was you, did you look, i don't need anyone to tell me i'm cold.

## what else could it be?
well, if you don't need me anymore, i guess that's it.

## will you two be all right?
yeah.

## you really didn't hear anything?
no.

## what about you?
i did all right.

## why do we have to be in this weird old house?
i like this house.

## doing or wearing?
yeah, no kidding.

## did you see what she had on yesterday?
wow.

## you just saw something move?
i saw something in the fireplace.

## you were here alone?
mm hmm.

## luke, can you help me?
just ashes.

## god, are you all right?
yeah, i'm fine.

## what is that?
a flue.

## is this what you saw?
no.

## hey, you guys should take a look at this.
hey, are you okay?

## what does that mean?
his face.

## what?
come on.

## do you really think i wrote that?
you found it.

## what are you talking about?
let's stop this now.

## who was it?
whoever wrote this, it's cruel.

## are you all right?
i know you think i did it, but i didn't.

## do you really think that someone's playing with you, eleanor?
yeah, it doesn't matter.

## hmm?
eleanor, the ledger.

## what?
it's crain's study.

## yeah, what?
there's hundreds of them.

## can we talk about this in the morning?
they showed me.

## how'd you find them?
the blood led me to the bookcase.

## the blood?
little footprints in blood.

## nell, you just gotta get some sleep, okay?
you've gotta sleep.

## dr. marrow?
eleanor vance continues... her alienation of the other subjects.

## what about all the noises, and the fireplace and the painting?
god, i've been looking for you everywhere.

## are you okay?
mm hmm.

## then who?
oh, no.

## eleanor, the fireplace.
what?

## where are you?
i'm here.

## where?
that's where you are.

## what's that smell?
i'm trying.

## what?
he killed them.

## killed who, eleanor?
calm down, now.

## and why?
she's delusional.

## but what is happening to her?
she's in a fugue state.

## what if she's right?
now, listen to me, all of you.

## is that it?
yes.

## what is your problem?
i gave you the clues.

## you don't feel.
a controlled experiment?

## where are you going?
i'm gonna find out what eleanor was talking about.

## what am i doing?
good night.

## who was holding my hand?
eleanor, don't be afraid.

## you can understand me?
help us, eleanor.

## climb over and step on the platform.
what?

## can you do that?
i can't.

## we have to wait until the dudleys arrive.
please?

## what?
that's real compassionate.

## i didn't write that, okay?
you'd never write that.

## jesus, i need to get them out of here.
that wouldn't be ethical, would it?

## what happened?
it's not real.

## ad?
oh, my god.

## eleanor?
come on.

## eleanor?
listen.

## eleanor?

backpacking is just an expression.

## for what?
fine.

## i mean, like, why are you here all by your eyelashes?

he's tall.

## you want me to trust some person that would go off with a complete stranger?
of course i'd tell you.

## what are you doing?
get calder.

## she wants freedom?
let freedom ring.

## what do you want now?
ben calder.

## sir?
make sure she has no idea who you are.

i'm all right.

## yes?
so...

## can i make you a sandwich?
no, i'm cool.

## there's something not exactly right about it, isn't there?
i mean, it's not bad.

## how's she gonna do all that?
women, you know, they think about that a lot.

## how do you know that?
well, you know, even i had a mother.

## she looks so free, doesn't she?
no one's judging her, no boss to worry about, no guys to worry about, no games to figure her way through.

## okay, can i just think for one second?
take your time.

## how do i get that in?
because i think you're onto something.

## aren't you?
well, i was thinking about a play on words.

## thank you.
playing games versus playing sports?

## do you like any of this?
a lot.

## all right.
did i say that out loud?

## uh, well, can i be honest with you?
please do.

## really?
all right.

## why what?
why won't why don't i just work on these story boards... and then bring them back around to you tomorrow if you're free.

## are you all right?
fine.

## you sure you're all right?
yeah, i'm fine.

## you laughing at me?
yeah.

## what time is it?
it's after 10:00.

## sorry?
i didn't realize how late it was.

## you want me to give you a hand with some of this?
no, thanks.

## what's going on?
well, i have an early meeting tomorrow with dan, and i wanted to make it later in the week so that i could be more prepared.

## really?
i insist.

## you have?
no, i don't.

## control top panty hose?
okay.

## seriously?
oh, yeah.

## and how did you look in them?
it was the turquoise wonderbra they noticed.

## because it's gray?
gray is the new black.

## hmm?
i wanna talk to you about something that's pretty important.

## can you pass the bread?
well, you know, boys and girls think very differently about sex.

## whereas guys and not all guys, alright?
but most guys, they pretty much just wanna have sex.

## and mom knows me for real and knows my friends and knows cameron, so let's leave the parental talks up to her, okay?
plus i promised cameron i'd do it.

## what new thing?
this ridiculous new guy you're trying to be.

## watch friends together?
i mean, it's nuts after 15 years of no relating.

## who are you to talk about relationships anyway?
you never had a real relationship with anyone in your entire life.

## so i'm gonna go, okay?
sure.

## johnny come lately, giving her advice?
oh, teenagers.

## how did you know it was me?
i didn't say anything.

## excuse me?
i didn't mean to really call you.

## yeah?
it's a relief an enormous relief.

## do you have any idea how rare it is for someone to actually like that about me?
trust me, this has not been a great thing in my life.

## a smart person would just get so very drunk now.
he didn't love you?

## how long were you married?
a little less than a year.

## you know that, right?
oh, yeah.

## what was that like?
it was great in the beginning.

## do you wanna know all this about me?
keep going.

## why?
i don't know.

## like what?
for starters, you really love what you do.

## how can you say that?
you're so great at it.

## you wanna hear something really great?
yeah.

## what?
i wish i was a mind reader.

## if we kissed, would it ruin everything?
listen to me.

## don't let this get weird at work?
no.

## good night.
do you want to come back to my place?

## what am i doing?
lola.

## lola?
i know i haven't heard from you.

## lola, how long have you been out here?
just a few... hours.

## you did?
it's so obvious.

## how else would you know the things that you know?
it wasn't obvious to anybody else.

## based on the other night just put me out of my misery.
i am?

## are you or aren't you?
say you're gay.

## you'll be the first to know.
how gay?

## you promise?
oh, yeah, i promise.

## thanks for pep talk, yes?
you two just take care of each other.

## you wear it well, yes?
happy trails, kids.

## who knows?
yeah.

## what fool turned her down?
you did, sire.

## well, did i ever meet with her at least?
i don't think so.

## it's true.
you're doing darcy?

## will you stop it?
they are.

## are you officially a woman now?
oh, i wish.

## you know who has penis envy?
we do.

## you ready?
okay.

## why are you not the happiest guy in chicago right now?
i wanna show you something.

## please?
please.

## should i close my eyes or anything?
no.

## so, you see those top two floors right there?
i do.

## what are you thinking?
you've got that look you have sometimes.

## yeah?
no.

## you can see all that?
maybe you're naked and i'm the only guest, but it'd still be elegant.

## where is that coming from?
let's turn up the volume.

## so, where's your bed going?
uh, right... here.

## dan?
i gotta talk to you.

## yeah?
he'll be there.

## darcy?
please.

## but this isn't about that?
no, no.

## what do you mean?
this is the biggest account this company has ever landed.

## what are you talking about?
darcy's here.

## why?
let me tell you something.

## this is all about saving your ass, right?
save it.

## erin?
i don't think she's in today.

## did she call in sick?
i don't think so.

## where's the geek in the glasses who carries all the files?
hey.

## no?
keep trying.

## do you know where this is?
yes, erin.

## okay?
i just wanted to come and see how you are.

## how are you?
as a matter of fact, i was just thinking that.

## you were... thinking that just now?
yeah, in my head.

## but you're, you know, not thinking anything now, are you?
i'm thinking a million things.

## you are thinking something right this minute?
mr. marshall, i am thinking that you are crazier than i am.

## yeah?
i'm sorry.

## is there something i can maybe do for you?
no.

## for me?
yeah.

## what makes you think that i would, uh, do something to hurt myself?
i just sensed it.

## you could sense that?
well, that's not that's not good.

## i'll get back as soon as i can.
didn't you try and meet with me a while back?

## darcy?
hi, darcy, it's nick.

## are you all right?
i hope so.

## you're not, right?
no, i didn't think so.

## darcy?
no, it's me.

## are you back in town already?
no, not until tomorrow.

## isn't she at the prom?
the prom.

## about this high?
she's been there for, like, an hour.

## alex, are you in here?
alex, it's me.

## i wasn't there when you left for the prom.
what are you doing here?

## yeah, well, that's not why i'm in here, so you can just go, okay?
oh, boy, i feel awful.

## i already took my hair out and everything.
are you okay?

## what have you got to lose?
i'm sorry.

## and look at you.
you know how ahead of the game you are?

## that clown made out with a girl with a tongue ring over you?
honey... you look beautiful.

## what am i doing?
she's not in the refrigerator.

## hello?
uh, hi, it's me.

## you need to what?
it's 1:00 in the morning.

## so, you sleep here now?
i thought i might as well give it a try before i have to sell the place.

## sell it?
you're not selling the place.

## oh, do i?
you're a riot.

## you know that?
it's true.

## why would he tell you that?
i didn't do the job he hired me to do.

## how is that possible?
oh, trust me, it's possible.

## well, who would do such an awful thing?
i would.

## have you ever done that?
taken the wrong road and no, of course you haven't.

## that you weren't really a winner?
everything about you how smart you are, how good you are everything just makes me want you even more.

## that's it?
i don't want that to be it.

## what kind of knight in shining armor would i be... if the man i love needs rescuing... and i just let him walk out my door?
my hero.

## why?
objects may appear larger.

## huh?
that other thing we were talking about before.

## can i write that down?
all right.

## what if he says i'm not?
he won't say that you're not.

## and?
i said what you said.

## and then he said?
i don't know.

## can i make you a sandwich?
no, i'm cool.

## there's something not exactly right about it, isn't there?
i mean, it's not bad.

## missed that?
it's okay, i can do it again.

## you'll be taking orders from me.

## any questions?
good.

## you want to catch the hunter?
you start with the prey.

## so... what's first?
the house of pain.

## where's the entrance?
i don't see any signs.

## why don't you post up on the roof over there?

## what exactly are we looking for in here?
anything that looks suspicious.

## scud, you reading me?

blade, i'm talking to you.

## what happens at sunrise?
we hunt.

## in broad daylight?
you got be joking.

## what are you looking for?
phosphor rods.

## hmm?
the way you talk to them us.

## why do you hate us so much?

## how long have you known blade, anyway?
going on 20 years.

## how'd you two hook up?
i was backpacking.

## how are we going to find these reapers?
we won't have to.

## what is this shit?
pheromones.

## they want us to spray on some suckpuppy's nut juice?

## and you, you're not coming?
no.

## you and miss muffet getting a little cozy?

## what is it, my daughter?
they took them.

## where are we?
some kind of chamber deep in their lair.

## what?
designed.

## did he?
how generous of him.

## you want to explain how nomak got ahold of this ring?
i would have thought that was obvious at this point.

## you thought you had me on a short leash, didn't you, jefe?
much better.

## see this?
they needed my help to bring you here to control nomak.

## i practically handed them the keys.
you think they scoped out my security system?

## you heard cue ball, right?
pretty soon they're all going to be daywalkers.

## what do you think about that?
two things one...

## what else should i find out?
i trusted you with my men ; with my will ; with my life.

## the spider, or the fly?
